The woman was rolled into the emergency department by paramedics Struggling to breathe she bent forward hands on her knees using gravity to help expand her chest This all started when she was admitted and now shes worse her husband told me A few weeks earlier pneumonia had put her in the hospital for five days When her oxygen levels improved she was discharged but at home she struggled to get out of bed and couldnt shake a deep fatigue The day I saw her in the ER her breathing was becoming increasingly labored Her lungs sounded quiet and clear but her heartbeat was rapid Her forearms were covered with red and purple bruises the aftermath of daily blood tests Her face was gaunt her lips were dry According to her husband she rarely slept and ate poorly while in the hospital She was losing weight Her husbands description led me to a diagnosis that my colleagues and I are increasingly recognizing posthospital syndrome Its long been known that hospitals can be the source of illness   million Americans develop hospitalacquired infections each year But posthospital syndrome is something different and more ominous In a  paper Dr Harlan Krumholz a professor of medicine and public health at Yale School of Medicine  that emerges in the days and weeks after a hospital stay Physiologic systems are impaired reserves are depleted and the body cannot effectively avoid or mitigate  health threats He called this period of vulnerability posthospital syndrome  The syndrome was identified as a result of new Medicare rules that hold hospitals responsible for readmissions within  days after discharge When health systems began studying patients who returned to the hospital soon after discharge two critical facts emerged First the problem is common and widespread occurring after nearly one in five hospitalizations of patients on Medicare Second and even more surprising the majority of cases represent an illness distinct from the initial hospitalization  Posthospital syndrome is therefore not a relapse it is a state of susceptibility that most often leads to a new affliction Infections for instance which are known complications of a hospital stay were just one small category of posthospital illnesses tracked in a large study of Medicare admissions Others included heart failure gastrointestinal conditions mental illness nutritionrelated problems electrolyte imbalances and trauma probably from falls and weakness  My patient was an example of this After the hospital stay her bodys defenses were crippled and dehydration nutritional depletion and overall weakness took a toll But her pneumonia  the reason for her initial hospitalization  had resolved   Dr Krumholz and Dr Allan Detsky a professor of health policy at the University of Toronto for the first time described precisely how to fix posthospital syndrome fix the hospital In many ways the hospital environment can be the opposite of healing Dr Krumholz said Beeping machines frequent needle sticks unpredictable waits to see the doctor unappetizing food and sleep deprivation are among the barrage of stressors he cites  The result is that hospitalized patients are often deconditioned in pain malnourished stressed with circadian disruptions he said And we ask why patients return to the hospital Maybe its what weve done to them To help solve the problem Drs Detsky and Krumholz have proposed sweeping changes in hospital care Their recommendations range from more cheerful dcor and preserving dignity by having patients wear their own clothing to reducing needles and procedures In the kind of selfsearching language rarely seen in scientific journals they call out most hospitals for serving a draconian unsavory diet at a time when eating well is critical for healing They also cite sleep deprivation caused by machine alarms unnecessary wakeups and preventable room traffic Ironically the intensity with which medical providers work to cure the problems that bring a patient into the hospital may be creating the very problems that bring them back Our mentality is that the hospital is a battlefield and everyone will have to deal with the fallout Dr Krumholz told me Posthospital syndrome however suggests that patients can be the victims of friendly fire My patient began to look and feel better with intravenous fluids and her breathing eased When her primary care doctor arrived we devised a plan for her second hospital stay Her husband brought in her favorite foods each day and jealously guarded her sleep Physical therapists worked with her to quickly increase mobility And her doctor ordered that needles and procedures be avoided whenever possible Within three days she was home functional and slowly recovering Many of the changes proposed in the paper have already been put in place in some institutions In pediatric hospitals certainly dcor is often bubbly and bright painful procedures are minimized Most hospitals now have wards that offer at a cost amenities including better food and service that is centered around a patients needs  proof that care can be structured with the patient in mind Of course hospital care represents a vast industry with many stakeholders and whether fundamental change can happen or how quickly remains to be seen Modern medicine is famous for being slow to adjust to new evidence  But Dr Krumholz is focusing on the basics There doesnt have to be all this collateral damage he said We can create a healing environment
