With the launch of new health insurance exchanges just about two weeks away many of the questions in this months mailbag focused less on the big picture and more on exactly how the law will operate for individuals We cant answer every question we get But here is a sampling of questions that were really popular or that would apply to a lot of people The subsidies which are available to those earning between  percent and  percent of the   are based on your   or MAGI That includes things like wages and interest less deductions like tuition and alimony and additional payroll taxes paid by the selfemployed Youll be asked to estimate what your income will be for next year if youre wrong youll have to reconcile with the IRS come tax time the following April If you dont have insurance youll get a bill just like now If you cant pay the hospital or other health care provider will still try to collect from you although there are some provisions of the law aimed at   that have been used in the past If they dont collect the health care provider would have to eat the cost Thats why hospitals were so anxious to have most people covered by insurance so they could stop having to provide so much free care to people who couldnt pay The answer to this question actually turns out to be a little bit tricky For those lucky enough to have health coverage provided by a former employer yes that generally qualifies as coverage for purposes of   Then theres the question of whether it bars you from going to the exchange and shopping for a better deal Generally if you have employer coverage you cant do that But it turns out that retiree coverage is sort of a special category According to a Treasury Department spokeswoman yes you can drop your retiree coverage and go shop on the exchanges And if your income is low enough you can be eligible for a subsidy But you can make that move only during open enrollment season So you need to be ready to look starting Oct  To answer Hellers question first no You cant just sign up when youre sick and facing big medical bills Otherwise thats what everyone would do The exchanges under the Affordable Care Act have been designed pretty much the same way most employer insurance plans are Theres an   every year when you can buy or change plans but with only a few exceptions thats the only time you can buy or change plans This years open season is a lengthy one  it runs from Oct  to March   In   it will begin in October and end in December of each year That means if you decide to go without insurance and pay the fine and you get sick its on you until the next open season When it comes to Simons question yes moving to a different state is one of   that allow you to buy or change plans outside the normal openenrollment periods So is getting married or divorced giving birth to or adopting a child or losing your jobbased insurance Any of those life events triggers a special day enrollment period where you can change or buy health insurance on an exchange Otherwise youll have to wait until the next open enrollment Indeed the nickname for the law did begin as a pejorative one and was used almost exclusively by its opponents during consideration of the legislation and early implementation of the law But President Obama himself made an   during the  campaign The campaign   proclaiming I like Obamacare Around that time many NPR reporters and hosts began using the phrase to describe the law although usually not on first reference It certainly no longer carries the purely negative inferences it used to as   recently acknowledged in a column
