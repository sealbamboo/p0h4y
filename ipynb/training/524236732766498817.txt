Last month, CVS Health purged its 7,700 pharmacies of tobacco products in a gambit to embrace a commitment to improving public health and generate goodwill. But the move comes with a price – an estimated $2 billion in annual sales will be sacrificed.. Now, the company is hoping to find a way to compensate for that bet. Its Caremark pharmacy benefits manager, which is one of the largest in the U.S., will soon require some customers to make a $15 co-payment on any prescription that is filled at a pharmacy selling cigarettes and other tobacco products.
