 The st century Christmas meal may feel like a bellybursting calorieladen arteryfurring feast but in the eyes of Jacobean and Victorian high society it would have been viewed as a mere side course  One of the earliest Christmas recipes in curator and food historian Ivan Days collection dates back to the s  Robert Mays The Accomplisht Cook describes a multicourse menu of more than  dishes  Diners could begin with oysters or perhaps brawn  a pickled pork prepared with domestic boar meat and poached in wine vinegar and spices until tender enough to falloff the bone  Cooks were encouraged to harvest the savoury jelly byproduct produced while making this  Splashes of red and yellow colouring were added with the help of cochineal and saffron  And the gelatinous fat was carved into a decorative garnish and served as a calorierich treat Robert Mays bill of fare also lists a variety of birds from the more familiar goose to plovers  now on the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds conservation list  Plovers were generously smothered in lard as were rabbits woodcock curlew pheasants and partridge  According to Ivan Day for many people this Yuletide meal would have been a feast after relative famine  To us this would be an arteryclogging meal with a ridiculous amount of food but people were more active back then  The working classes would endure hard manual jobs and even the most wealthy would have been riding all the time hunting or going to war And looking back to before the Reformation people would have fasted for many days during Advent breaking their fast with the Christmas breakfast On special occasions landed gentry would organise meals for their workers and Christmas dinner would be seen as an opportunity to stock up on calories at the expense of the rich  The   written in the th century describes vast quantities of roast beef and plum pudding made to fill the poorer mouths of the parish  Recipes for plum pudding could include many pounds of suet and sugar as well lots of candied peel and dried fruit  Mr Day says This may not be ideal for the sedentary office worker but for many people living back then this would have been burntoff pretty quickly Though turkey takes pride of place in Christmas cuisine today many other meats crowned the Christmas table in years gone by  According to Mr Day the choice of meat was dictated by household practicalities  People have been unable to feed all their animals through winter months so many would be culled and eaten before the coldest days arrived  And game  including pheasants grouse and partridge  would have been nearing their fattest at this point in the year  Another unusual meat to top the Christmas menu was British turtle as seen in a Bristol tavern menu from  above  Mr Day questions whether this was a rare reptile washing up on the shores of the Bristol channel or whether it was mock turtle made of a calf head substitute  The impressive menu scroll has more than  options including cows heel and crabs  According to Theodore Garretts The Encyclopaedia of Practical Cookery published in the s guests of Queen Victoria would have feasted on beef boars heads game pie and brawn  These dishes would have graced just the side table Pheasants veal pork and fish would have all been served at Christmas too  But for the more everyday Christmas meal Victorian housewives could turn to Ross Murrays The Modern Householder  His book suggests swan was a popular local dish at Christmas time roasted on a spit in front of a fire  Serving suggestions included garnishing with little swans carved out of turnips and paper frills   And accompanying illustrations suggest this could be placed on an elaborate table complete with boars head punch jelly and truffles  Mr Day says It is not easy to generalise the Christmas meals of the past  Most will have depended on the social class and wealth of the people sitting down to eat  But the majority would have had very different and less luxurious everyday diets to the general pattern of over consumption familiar today
