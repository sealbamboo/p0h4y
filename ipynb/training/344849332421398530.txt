energy expenditure had arrived at Arizona State University where Dr Meckes was a researcher To ensure they were operational he slipped one over his hip and wore it throughout the day including to an interminable meeting where he stood up and paced Im not good at sitting still he says Checking his monitor afterward though he was flabbergasted It had recorded that I was not moving at all says Dr Meckes now an assistant professor at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa Calif The experience inspired him to set up an experiment examining how reliable such devices are Until recently accelerometers which use electronics to determine bodily movement and intensity had been confined to research laboratories But now athome users can choose from a variety of devices sold under such brand names as Fitbit and Nike FuelBand Some are worn on the hip others on the arm or wrist All sense movement and feed data into the devices electronic brain where proprietary equations determine how much energy someone is expending meaning in practical terms how many calories they burn But by and large users have had to take such measurements on faith Unbiased comparative studies of the devices havent been available Which makes Dr Meckess experiment useful and timely particularly since his results presented last month in Indianapolis at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine join those of a number of other new studies in raising concerns about just how well todays activity monitors do their job For his experiment Dr Meckes gathered  adult volunteers and fitted each with three different monitors two worn on the hip and one around the arm The volunteers also donned portable masks that measure oxygen consumption the gold standard in determining energy output The volunteers then threw themselves into a variety of activities in the universitys physiology lab including walking on a treadmill cleaning a simulated kitchen standing up typing at a computer and playing a board game All three of the devices accurately measured energy expenditure when the volunteers walked briskly Dr Meckes and his colleagues found their estimates closely matched those of the oxygenconsumption monitor But the devices were far less reliable in tracking the energy costs of lightintensity activities like standing or cleaning often misinterpreting them as physical immobility Only the calorie cost of typing was overestimated and only by the armband monitor which considered the arm movements involved to be far more dynamic than they actually are These miscalculations echo those of the findings from several other new studies One also reported at the sports medicine meeting involved  adults young and old who wore an armband accelerometer and a portable oxygenconsumption gauge while walking jogging riding a stationary bicycle windmilling an arm ergometer and completing socalled activities of daily living like lifting boxes and sweeping Again the accelerometer measured the more strenuous bodily movements like jogging fairly accurately But it significantly underestimated subtler activities like sweeping and was terrible at measuring bicycle pedaling which involves no arm movement says Glenn Gaesser the director of the Healthy Lifestyles Research Center at Arizona State University in Phoenix who oversaw the study So too a study   in Medicine  Science in Sports  Exercise found that several hipmounted accelerometers underestimated the energy involved in standing up bicycling and walking or jogging uphill says Ray Browning an assistant professor of exercise science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who led the study The question of course is whether it matters if the devices are inaccurate especially if they underestimate daily energy expenditure and perhaps fiendishly spur some athome users to move more thinking that theyve expended less energy than they actually have The studies researchers think the inaccuracies do matter Theres a growing consensus among exercise scientists Dr Meckes says that people should spend less time in sedentary activities like sitting and instead stand up stroll or sweep more But if people get the idea from their activity monitors that such activities dont really count in terms of movement and calorie expenditure it may be harder to get that message across he says The good news is that accelerometers are improving Dr Browning says The algorithms underlying the devices measurements  which are developed by engineers using data from people wearing the devices  are constantly being refined And researchers including Dr Browning are exploring better monitor placement At Colorado State for instance he and his colleagues have created a prototype shoebased accelerometer which embeds the electronics in an insole In his recent study this device better captured changes in posture and foot pressure than hiplevel accelerometers Still the lesson at the moment for anyone who owns an accelerometer is that the devices measurements are likely to be imperfect  which says Dr Gaesser does not mean you should stash yours in a drawer They may not be accurate for counting calories he says But for many people theyre inspirational and if using one gets someone to move more then as far as Im concerned its serving a good purpose
