Most people dont start thinking about the health of their bones until midlife or later by which time it can be too late to do very much to protect against serious bone loss and resulting fractures Researchers who study bone health say concern about the strength of ones bones should start in childhood and continue through   when the body builds most of the bone that must sustain it for the remaining years of life Once peak bone mass has been reached further gains are minimal so childhood through adolescence is the best time to pay attention to bone development By age  girls have gained between  and  percent of their peak bone mass For boys the peak occurs a few years later About  percent of total adult bone is accrued in two years around the time that bone mass increases the most  at age  in girls and  in boys The amount of bone added during those two years is about the same as what is typically lost in the  years between ages  and  Lifelong studies have not been done in people but the best available evidence strongly indicates that increasing peak bone mass in childhood by just  percent could delay   especially in postmenopausal women by about  years Although nothing can be done about the three factors with the greatest influence on bone mass  age gender and    two others under personal control can make the difference between suffering crippling fractures in midlife and escaping the effects of osteoporosis until after age  Those are   and the bonebuilding nutrients   and vitamin D While the focus here will be on the effects of exercise it should be noted that calcium consumption by adolescent girls is often seriously inadequate compromising their ability to build strong bones that will last a lifetime Exercise affects bone strength in two ways in response to the pressure of gravitational forces like those experienced when walking running or jumping and in reaction to the stress exerted by muscle   You might think that any kind of exercise is good for bones and the more active a child is the better That is largely but not always true On average as with adults active children have higher bone mineral density and reduced risk of fractures compared with their inactive counterparts Dr Kirk L Scofield noted last year in   But some types of activities are better than others Studies have found that the bone mineral density of young endurance runners is consistently lower than that of sprinters gymnasts or ball sports athletes In fact those engaged in endurance and nonweightbearing activities sometimes have weaker bones and a greater risk of fractures both while actively competing and later in life than their inactive peers Repetitive stress can tear down bone and is not the best for increasing bone strength Dr Scofield said in an interview Its not that running walking cycling or swimming are bad Theyre just not as good for bone strength as other types of athletic activities Bones he said seem to respond best to a combination of stress rest and variety which suggests that youngsters engaged in endurance activities should also do crosstraining to maximize bone strength Dr Scofield a sports medicine specialist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis said that the most effective form of stress on bones is that which works against gravity and starts and stops as happens when playing soccer basketball or tennis doing gymnastics or dancing using resistance equipment or lifting weights In a   of  college women who participated in NCAA Division  sports runners had the lowest bone density values at every site measured except their legs Swimmers and divers also showed bone deficits when compared with those who played soccer or field hockey for example An   of young female aerobic dancers squash players and speed skaters found that sports training that involves high strain rates in versatile movements and high peak forces is more effective in bone formation than training with a large number of lowforce repetitions A major bonerobbing issue for some young athletes especially women is what sports specialists call energy availability  the amount of energy they consume during exercise minus the amount they expend divided by their lean body mass muscle and bone It represents the energy left to support all the bodys functions including formation of new bone Low energy availability can result from insufficient calorie intake excessive calorie expenditure during exercise or a combination of the two even if the athlete does not appear to be underweight and is not undernourished Dr Scofield said Runners for example may burn so many calories theres not enough energy left to maintain normal bone health He recommends a nutrition consultation for young athletes who suffer stress fractures an indication of bone weakness that can be from low energy availability A related concern that can result from excessive training is a syndrome called female athlete triad  an interrelationship between energy availability menstrual function and bone density Girls who overexercise and dont consume enough calories to support all bodily functions can suffer menstrual irregularity or lose their periods entirely which can lead to muscle and bone injuries In a   of  females athletes at three high schools published in The Journal of Athletic Training last year researchers in Provo Utah found that nearly  percent experienced menstrual irregularities and  percent developed musculoskeletal injuries with the highest percentage of injuries among those with irregular or missing periods I asked Dr Scofield what advice he would give to the parents of young children and adolescents His response Get kids away from electronics and encourage them to play actively and do a lot of different activities Equally important is to avoid pressuring them to be too thin He also urged adequate consumption of calciumrich foods like dairy products and canned salmon and sardines with the bones An assessment of calcium intake can be determined from a   Children ages  through  should consume  milligrams of calcium daily and those  through   milligrams If children are not getting enough calcium from their diet Dr Scofield recommends that they take a calcium supplement with vitamin D  is needed for the body to absorb and utilize dietary calcium and children ages  through  need  International Units daily Most vitamin D is obtained when skin is exposed to sunlight but the widespread use of potent sunscreens has greatly reduced this source so a supplement may be essential
