A lack of beds is forcing mental health patients in England to seek treatment in other NHS facilities up to hundreds of miles away BBC research has found The number of patients travelling to seek emergency treatment has more than doubled in two years  from  people in  to  in  Earlier this year one patient was admitted to a deaf unit as no beds were available anywhere in the country Health minister Norman Lamb said outofarea treatment was a last resort The care and support minister added that it was unacceptable if patients had to travel hundreds of miles for treatment and said he was determined to drive up standards of care in the NHS Leading charities have called the situation scandalous and a disgrace One mental health trust spent  last year placing patients in bedandbreakfast accommodation in order to free up muchneeded beds Mental health trusts are   over the past two years and the problems in the system have come to light following a   Sending patients out of area can be appropriate for specialist treatments Figures obtained as part of the investigation through Freedom of Information requests show some trusts are managing to maintain or even reduce the number of people they send elsewhere But the data from  of Englands  mental health trusts shows that overall the number of patients sent out of area has more than doubled between  and  The increase comes despite the number of patients being admitted to hospital for mental health problems falling slightly from  in  to  in  Kent and Sussex are among the worstaffected areas In Kent  patients were sent out of the county last year at a cost of m compared with just  people in  at a cost of  One patient complained she was made to sleep on a mattress on the floor due to the lack of beds The trust said there was unprecedented demand for beds last year In Sussex the number of patients sent out of area increased from  in  to  last year Lisa Rodrigues chief executive of the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said rising demand for mental health services and cuts to community services by councils were creating problems She said Mental health services are a barometer of how the system is operating and if you remove some of the lower levels of support that people rely on to maintain their lives its not surprising that theyll present in crisis We are seeing people coming to hospital who are much much iller when they arrive so we have higher numbers of detained patients but much more than that were seeing people have to stay in hospital for longer One patient who knows what its like to be transported far from home is Alison not her real name  The yearold from York who suffers from bipolar disorder was taken to a hospital in London  miles km away in the middle of the night when health officials couldnt find a bed for her closer to home Though she praises her treatment she says it was a shock to the system and the distance was difficult to cope with With me not being near friends and family I suffered I had anxiety I wanted to speak to people and have familiarity around me she said Other patients have had to travel even further with people being sent from Devon to West Yorkshire  miles and Oxford to Teesside  miles A London trust  Barnet Enfield and Haringey  has been reprimanded by the regulator the Care Quality Commission CQC for using seclusion units as bedrooms It also started to move patients out of beds and into bedandbreakfast accommodation The figures show that  people were sent to BBs last year The trust said the patients were fit to be discharged from hospital but had accommodation problems  however it admitted it was not ideal for patients A board meeting of the Birmingham and Solihull trust in January heard a complaint from a patient who was admitted to a deaf ward despite not being deaf which she says made her feel stressed and unable to communicate with staff and patients  An investigation by the trust found this had happened because there were no female beds available in the country Procedures have now been changed the trust says which should ensure it never happens again  Marjorie Wallace of the mental health charity SANE said This situation is a result of the longstanding agenda to reduce the number of psychiatric beds the most expensive element of care But this is a false economy  leading to misery for many who struggle to access the treatment they need and undermining their chances for recovery Paul Farmer chief executive of mental health charity Mind said It is a disgrace that people with mental health problems are being sent miles away from family and friends or being accommodated in inappropriate settings when they are acutely unwell This is the latest in a long line of clear signals that at least in some parts of the country NHS mental health services are in crisis Continued cuts to funding for mental health services are taking a significant toll on the quality and availability of services Mark Winstanley chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness added Its absolutely scandalous that people with serious mental health problems are being treated in such a terrible way  Anyone going through a mental health crisis should expect to get help in a therapeutic environment where they can get better  The last thing they need is to be shunted to a hospital hundreds of miles away or even worse left to fend for themselves in a bed and breakfast Karen Wolton a member of the Mental Health Lawyers Association commented Weve noticed a sharp increase in the last year with inappropriate admissions for outofarea beds Weve had people admitted from where they live in Margate to WestonSuperMare which is a trip of  miles Weve had people overdosing in order to obtain a bed Theyve told us that they deliberately overdosed because thats the only way to get a bed Weve also had people who are inappropriately discharged after long spells in psychiatric hospitals theyre being discharged to bed and breakfast accommodation Mr Lamb admitted there was an institutional bias against mental health in regard to waitingtime targets When the week maximum waiting time was established in the last decade it applied only to physical health he told the BBC That left out mental health and incredibly politically significant targets of that sort dictate where the money goes  The situation has to change he added But Labours public health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said mental health services were suffering from repeated government budget cuts Under David Cameron wards are operating beyond safe occupancy levels and patients are turned away she said  Ministers must ensure that mental health services are accessible They claim to support parity of esteem between mental and physical health but patients are being badly let down
