Dr Karl Bilimoria a surgeon at Northwestern University and the American College of Surgeons advises that identifying and addressing these questions may help ensure a healthy recovery after an operation In August Bilimoria and researchers at the American College of Surgeons released an online tool that allows patients in collaboration with their doctors to estimate what their risks may be in undertaking an operation   was created by using data from  million American patients and  operations ranging from tonsillitis to breast reconstruction It takes into account  preoperative patient risk factors including a patients risk of dying and possible complications such as pneumonia heart problems surgical site infection blood clots urinary tract infections and kidney failure It also projects how long the patient may have to stay in the hospital after the operation  This tool prompts an important discussion between a patient and his or her doctor that may not have happened otherwise Bilimoria said If you still have concerns here is a set of basic questions to ask your doctor to help promote these needed discussions What your doctor believes is best for you may not be what you think is best for yourself It is important to find out why this surgery is necessary and whether this surgery will necessitate more surgeries later  Some surgeries can benefit you for the rest of your life and some could require multiple additional procedures Knowing the possibilities of both the shortterm and longterm outcomes allows you to make a more informed decision and have more realistic expectations  Sometimes surgery can be avoided by taking medication or making lifestyle changes Establishing with your physician the risks and benefits of possible alternatives to surgery is an important step in addressing the big decision at hand In some cases surgery may not be necessary immediately but a condition will be monitored over time to take note of changes  It is important however to understand the implications of foregoing surgery Monitoring a condition might need to be continued over the course of decades  Make sure you keep copies of your medical files in case you move or change doctors If your surgery is not an emergency it can be helpful to tap the expertise of another physician about the necessity of performing a procedure  Most health plans including in certain instances Medicare will provide coverage for patients to seek a consultation with another physician about a procedure if the case is not an emergency Check with your primary care physician for suggestions of other doctors who can perform the same procedure  Bring your medical records during the consultation to avoid repeating tests that have already been performed  For emergency procedures a second opinion is not recommended The severity of the medical condition should always come first  The cost of surgery can be broken up into three parts a The surgeons fee b Hospital fees or ambulatory surgical center fees for outpatient services c Other professional services such as surgical assistants anesthesiologists medical consultants Be sure to consult your health plan to find out what portion of the cost you may have to pay out of pocket  is also a great tool to get a sense of how much your surgery should cost   Recovery time depends on a number of factors such as age health and type of procedure  Certain equipment tools and medication may be necessary as you recuperate  Knowing ahead of time which you will need after the procedure  will help speed up your recovery  Theres never such thing as too many questions Ask your doctor everything thats on your mind until you feel that you understand what will happen during the procedure   Read up on your surgery A good resource is    a website set up by the American College of Surgeons Division of Education Or just ask your doctor for any printed information that might help   When talking to your physician take notes or bring a friend or family member to do it for you
