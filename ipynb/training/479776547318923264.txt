The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta says that as many as  of its workers may have been accidentally exposed to live anthrax bacteria this month because of a safety problem at one of its labs Member station WABEs Michell Eloy reports from Atlanta that the CDC says the possible exposure occurred after researchers at a highsecurity lab failed to follow the correct procedure to deactivate the bacteria The problem was discovered last Friday and some of the anthrax may have become airborne in two labs as workers were transferring samples of potentially live anthrax to three lowersecurity labs that werent equipped to handle live strains In a statement the CDC says its taking aggressive steps to protect the health of all involved Officials say the risk of infection is low but that affected staff are being monitored and given antibiotics out of an abundance of caution They say theres no public risk of exposure Were aware of it and working with CDC FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said in an email Nothing leads us to believe its anything criminal at this point
