Warnings over ecigarettes are alarmist  and increasing their use could save many lives researchers have said For every million smokers who switch to ecigarettes more than  lives a year could be saved according to the University College London team  Meanwhile another group of Londonbased experts has attacked criticism of ecigarettes as misleading Last week the World Health Organization   The WHO said this was because they could increase the levels of some toxins and nicotine in the air Its report also warned about the risk of ecigarettes acting as a gateway by which nonsmokers might start smoking real cigarettes But the UCL team said the numbers of nonsmokers using ecigarettes amounted to less than  of the population according to the Smoking Toolkit study a monthly survey of smokers in England Prof Robert West added that even though some toxins were present in vapour from ecigarettes the concentrations were very low You have to be a bit crazy to carry on smoking conventional cigarettes when there are ecigarettes available he said The vapour contains nothing like the concentrations of carcinogens and toxins as cigarette smoke In fact concentrations are almost all well below a twentieth of cigarettes Using these estimates it would mean  lives a year being saved for every million smokers who exchanged real cigarettes for ecigarettes he said If all nine million UK smokers used them that would equate to  lives saved out of the current  premature deaths Prof West said His concerns were echoed by researchers at the National Addiction Centre based at Kings College London and the Tobacco Dependence Unit at Queen Mary University They carried out an analysis  published in the journal Addiction  of the WHO research which contributed to last weeks report They concluded that some of the assumptions WHO had made were misleading Lead researcher Prof Peter Hajek said I think any responsible regulator proposing restricting regulation has to balance reducing risks with reducing potential benefits In this case the risks are unlikely some already proven not to exist while the benefits are potentially enormous It really could be a revolutionary intervention in public health if smokers switched from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes So killing benefits which are huge for risks which are small is like asking people to stop using mobile phones and tablets or restrict their use and further development because of a one in  million chance that the battery might overheat in your device The WHO has yet to respond to the criticisms of its work Prof John Ashton president of the Faculty of Public Health which has been one of the bodies that has expressed concerns said he did not want to see a ban But he added We do want to be sure that any benefits they may have dont undo all the hard work thats been done over decades to save lives by reducing smoking We are particularly concerned that vaping may lead to young people starting to smoke cigarettes And he added At the moment there is very little hard data about ecigarettes until we get some solid facts on their impact on peoples health we need proper regulation Shirley Cramer chief executive officer of the Royal Society of Public Health said the argument was not clear cut Emerging evidence from the States suggests significant numbers of non smokers are using ecigarettes with the potential for them to get hooked on nicotine We need to curb the appeal of ecigarettes to nonsmokers  it would help if we stop marketing what is essentially a medicinal product as a cool or trendy fashion accessory
