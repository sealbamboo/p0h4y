So I got an email from a publicist asking me if I was interested in what has become a tremendously   titled  Foods We Eat In The US That Are Banned In Other Countries Curious I clicked as have more than  million other readers Whats my beef Well one of the eight bad boys of the US food supply according to the author is arsenic And I get it No one would choose to eat a toxic chemical But the claims made by the author  based on a book by Dr Jayson Calton and Mira Calton called  are out of date and misleading The article concludes that arsenic is used in chicken feed to make meat appear pinker and fresher And for more information BuzzFeed linked to an article that I wrote the site has since pulled the link see below But if anyone at BuzzFeed had actually read   they would have learned that while the poultry industry once used an arsenicbased drug called Roxarsone to stave off infections in chickens it was pulled from the market by its manufacturer in  And the National Chicken Council says that broiler chicken producers are no longer using arsenicbased drugs Now the claim that arsenic will kill you if you ingest enough as the article concludes is true But as scientists like to point out the dose makes the poison So lets look at the dose here Chicken meat tested in a study done before Roxarsone was pulled from the market contained about  ppb  thats parts per billion  of inorganic arsenic which is far below the  ppb tolerance levels set by the FDA Over the weekend when BuzzFeed pulled the link to my post it put up a correction notice stating Some studies linked in the original version of this article were concerning unrelated issues They have been replaced with information directly from the book    But heres the thing My post was not unrelated to the topic It just didnt support the notion that there was a danger here Derek Lowe a chemist and science blogger has   many of the other claims in the  Foods piece  for instance the statement that brominated vegetable oil found in many sports drinks and citrusflavored sodas is as the article says linked to major organ system damage birth defects growth problems schizophrenia and hearing loss As Lowe explains bromine   a hideously toxic substance  used as a flame retardant and as a battlefield gas But he gives a little chemistry lesson to explain that what ends up in our food supply  brominated vegetable oil  is chemically quite different And he too points to the issue of dose In very high amounts drunk over a long period of time BVO can build up in the body and cause toxic effects concludes a   that the BuzzFeed article linked to For instance there was a case of a man whod been complaining of headaches and fatigue who was found to have high levels of bromide in his blood But how much was he drinking Two to four liters of soda every day according to the report Writes Lowe Ouch There are other items on the list that seem to be yesterdays concerns For instance the fat substitute   Proctor  Gamble gave up on marketing the fat substitute years ago and it seems that now there are just a few fatfree potato chips left on the market that still contain it And earlier this year   brominated vegetable oil from Gatorade sports drinks
