British AE doctor Javid Abdelmoneim  spent a month in Sierra Leone treating victims of Ebola recording his experiences on specially designed goggle cameras for BBC Ones Panorama programme  With children you remember the ones who survive You almost never remember the children who died I guess it is a way of coping  Id been procrastinating all summer about going to West Africa When I got an email from the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres saying Were desperate it was the nudge I needed  They confirmed it at  BST on Friday and I left for Sierra Leone on the Monday arriving in Kailahun in the remote east of the country later that week  I was expecting to witness a great deal of suffering But you can never fully prepare yourself for the moment when you open an ambulance door and a dead body rolls out or for watching half of your patients die  As a doctor you have to recognise that working in an Ebola epidemic is completely different from how youd usually practise You know that you cant save every patients life but at least you can make sure that they have a painless death  Three or four of my patients died very sudden shocking deaths One man died on a Friday afternoon fully dressed and prostrated in the Muslim prayer position facing east  He had the strength to do his ablutions and kneel in prayer and then he died  it was so sudden he didnt even topple over  There were three young men  Mohamed Ahmed and Alfred aged   and   just boys  who all died on the same day Mohamed had a really long slow demise  it took him about two weeks to die  At the end he looked like a skeleton And Alfred was calling for his dad who was lying in the next tent also dying Three young men bang in one day  you have to ask yourself whats going on  In reflection I wonder whether I protected myself emotionally against the ones who were obviously going to die And did I get to know the ones who would survive Well why not You have to get through it somehow  Michael and Ambu two yearold boys were the first patients I got attached to They were so physically able and well despite testing positive for Ebola  They would call my name every morning as I came in and their English was pretty good so we would chat across the fence They said they were brothers but they just called each other that  everyone calls each other brother or cousin in Sierra Leone  Then I found out that Michaels sisters nineyearold Michaela and yearold Mariama were also in the Ebola treatment centre They immediately became my favourites too  They were special to me because they were just bundles of joy They had lost five siblings and their father and yet they never stopped smiling The last time I saw them was just before I left when I visited them in the orphanage where they were waiting for their mother to collect them  And then there were Alpha and Warrah two oneyear olds a boy and a girl who were being looked after by Abdul aged six I met them on my very first visit to the treatment centre and I thought Look at this sixyearold caring for these two oneyearolds Look at his humanity and think of the world leaving him to do this alone  With oneyearolds you have to find an informal carer from among the patients to look after them to change their nappies to wash them to feed them regularly These are things we do as a medical team but we cant do them very often as staff can only enter the highrisk zone in their protective suits for an hour at a time  So its good to have someone who can provide hour care Soon we found a lovely woman called Kadia who agreed to take on the role of informal carer  One of the oneyearolds died and one of them survived  the randomness of Ebola being orphaned surviving or dying alone  Alpha and Warrah epitomise everything that Ebola means to me  Watch Panorama Ebola Frontline on BBC One at  GMT on Monday  November or catch it later on the BBC
