For many years high medical bills have been a leading cause of financial distress and bankruptcy in America That pressure may be easing ever so slightly according to a survey released earlier this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But  in  Americans still face hardships due to medical costs  and AfricanAmericans continue to be the hardest hit A poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health found that  percent of AfricanAmerican families say theyve had problems paying for needed prescription drugs The poll is part of NPRs ongoing series The View From Black America Mike Jackson is one of those people Jackson  lives in Oklahoma City and works for a major insurance company He has high blood pressure and hypertension and has been diabetic for  years Treating these chronic health problems isnt cheap Jacksons medical bills add up to nearly  a month Jackson says Diabetes alone  just the two medications alone for diabetes would have run  a month Thats would have because Jackson couldnt pay This time last year he was laid off got divorced and lost his health benefits He worried that he wouldnt be able to afford the insulin he needs to control his diabetes so he started cutting back Instead of taking  units twice a day I was taking  units twice a day Jackson told NPR The idea behind that was if I watched what I would eat and then stay with the  units  I would keep my blood sugar down enough that hopefully it would not be much of a problem But cutting back on insulin for eight months did cause problems Jackson developed numbness in his foot and toes and nerve damage in his eye  all complications of uncontrolled diabetes My left eye actually shut wouldnt open Jackson says The muscle for my eyelid wont open An ophthalmologist gave Jackson a discount but Jackson is still struggling to make payments In response to an NPR Facebook callout yearold Ashley Liggins of Fort Worth Texas wrote that shell never forget being without health insurance and having to decide between medication for high blood pressure gas for her car or food for the week Like Jackson Liggins also tried to stretch out the medication she had by reducing the dose and even borrowing pills from her mother I was really worried says Liggins who now works in the financial services industry High blood pressure runs in my family A single mother of two wrote to us about being sued for unpaid medical bills totaling nearly  She has no idea how shell pay She too has high blood pressure a common worry among AfricanAmericans in our poll One in  AfricanAmericans surveyed said they too had serious problems paying bills from doctors or hospitals in the past year We specifically asked AfricanAmerican families what were the top concerns they had for health in their own families says Robert Blendon a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health who partnered with NPR for this survey And we ended up with high blood pressure stroke and diabetes as being the top Thats in contrast with other national surveys where cancer and other types of illnesses are often raised as the biggest concerns And even though most of the people in this poll did have health insurance nearly half still worried that if they suffered a major illness in the future they wouldnt be able to pay for medical care We found general economic insecurity among families who generally were doing well says Blendon and this fear of paying a larger medical bill was just one of the top problems they had For Mike Jackson covering the cost of caring for a chronic health problem became impossible Hes now working but its a temporary job that doesnt offer health benefits And Jackson worries every day about the future Its one of those things where if something happens to my car or to me healthwise Im in trouble If anything goes wrong Im one step away from disaster
