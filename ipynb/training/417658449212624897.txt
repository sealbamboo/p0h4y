The term life support exacerbates the problem too because those who are brain dead do not have a life to sustain said Arthur Caplan director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center This seems to be a fundamental problem in both cases that have entered the national spotlight he said  I think these cases have been botched horribly he said Theyre giving the impression that dead people can come back to life Heres a quick overview of the two situations  Doctors in Oakland California declared Jahi McMath  to be brain dead on December  three days after she underwent surgery to remove her tonsils adenoids  and extra sinus tissue which doctors thought were causing sleep apnea  She suffered complications from the procedure which experts have told CNN is commonly done but not routine  A judge concluded Tuesday that Jahi is brain dead but ruled that Jahi will remain on life support at least until December  The family of the teen is seeking to   the girls uncle Omari Sealy told reporters Thursday  Moving her would require the insertion of tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes family attorney Christopher Dolan said  However hospital Chief of Pediatrics David Durand said the judge didnt authorize a transfer to another facility  Childrens Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice Childrens Hospital Oakland continues to extend its wishes for peace and closure to Jahi McMaths family Durand said  But Jahis mother Nailah Winkfield said on Friday I would probably need for my childs heart to stop to show me that she was dead Her heart is still beating so theres still life there In Texas a hospital and family of a brain dead patient also clash over continuing life support but the situation is further complicated because the woman is pregnant  Marlise Munoz  has been unresponsive since November  when her husband Erick Munoz discovered her on the kitchen floor at their home said her mother Lynne Machado The family says she is being kept alive on a ventilator at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth Texas Her family says she would not want her life prolonged by a machine but Texas state law says lifesustaining treatment cannot be withheld from a pregnant patient regardless of her wishes or the age of the fetus At all times we will follow the law as it is applicable to health care in the state of Texas said JR Labbe vice president of communications and community affairs for JPS Health Network which oversees the hospital  These cases may make you think of   a braindamaged woman who died in  after living on a feeding tube for more than a decade Schiavo was the subject of a lengthy legal battle between her parents and her husband Michael Schiavo who maintained she wouldnt have wanted to live in a persistent vegetative state  But persistent vegatative state means the brain still has some activity even though the patient is in a deep state of unconsciousness Coma is another word for this    Both these situations are distinct from brain death  according to the   an individual is dead when he or she has sustained either  irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or  irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brain stem  It seems like there seems to continue to be confusion about what it means to die using neurologic criteria said Cynda Hylton Rushton professor of clinical ethics at Johns Hopkins University  Rushton suggests in fact that this phrase die using neurological criteria be used instead of brain death to emphasize what it means  Terms such as mechanical support or artificial machine support could be used to refer to sustaining the functioning of a brain dead person Caplan said  No one wants to take away life support  Caplan said  In Caplans view it doesnt do any families any good if hospitals ask them about mechanically continuing biological function in a brain dead patient He says doctors should be more transparent about the finality of brain death  It just creates the possibility of a terrible scenario like the one thats unfolded in Jahis case where the parents dont really understand and then start to resist any removal of machines because they just want to hope that the worst possible thing did not happen he said I dont think its kind to not be clear when death happens  In the Texas case Caplan noted where its the family against a law if Munoz is indeed brain dead she is not by definition receiving lifesustaining treatment  It seems to Caplan that the laws intention was not to continue treating the dead   That the heart can continue beating in a body like this is unnerving to people said Kenneth Goodman director of the Bioethics Program at the University of Miami One might argue that the fetus is alive and is the one on life support But that opens up a lot of other issues Will the fetus be viable Was it damaged by the mothers lack of oxygen when she lost consciousness Right now it is  weeks old Machado said doctors will know more about its health at  to  weeks  The Texas law in this case imposes the view of the state on the adult pregnant woman as to whether or not the fetus counts as a human being Peter Singer professor of bioethics at Princeton University said  The misunderstanding surrounding cases such as Jahis and Munozs signals a need for a national conversation about brain death and levels of brain functioning Caplan said  Although there are scientific criteria for brain death the concept contains a moral judgment Singer said When viewed in connection to organ transplantation there seems to be a value assessment that for instance the organs of a braindead person should be used to save someone elses life  Organ transplantation and the idea of brain death have different origins researchers argue in a   but they became linked in  when the first kidney transplant with a brain dead donor was performed  Had these procedures with brain dead patients not emerged until more recent decades in a cultural climate rife with righttolife debates perhaps there would have been more public discussion and controversy about the definition of brain death Singer said   The public might have taken a closer look at what matters Is it the person which exists by virtue of a functioning brain or the organism  If you think that somehow what is precious or what has a right to life is simply an organism then I suppose you might say Well this is not dead he said This organism is still able to function It needs medical support but of course theres a lot of people who need medical support Jahis family has said they are hoping for a miracle Such cases also bring up the question of what is societys responsibility to accommodate requests based on faith Rushton said  We really need to engage in a new dialogue that takes us out of the debate of faith into science into a conversation about what are the limits of our human knowledge and technology and how do we accept the fact that all of us will eventually die Rushton said These are the kinds of situations where there are no easy answers Medicine cant cure everything but we act as though death is optional she said  We may have technology called life support but even that cant last forever
