Exercise may help to keep the brain robust in people who have an increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease according to an inspiring new study The findings suggests that even moderate amounts of physical activity may help to slow the progression of one of the most dreaded diseases of aging  For the new study which was   researchers at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio recruited almost  older men and women aged  to  many of whom had a family history of Alzheimers disease Alzheimers disease characterized by a gradual and then quickening loss of memory and cognitive functioning can strike anyone But scientists have discovered in recent years that people who harbor a specific variant of a gene known as the APOE epsilon allele or the e gene for short have a substantially increased risk of developing the disease  Genetic testing among the volunteers in the new study determined that about half of the group carried the e gene although at the start of the study none showed signs of memory loss beyond what would be normal for their age  Then the scientists set out to more closely examine their volunteers brains  For some time researchers have suspected that Alzheimers disease begins altering the structure and function of the brain years or even decades before the first symptoms appear In particular its been thought that the disease silently accelerates the atrophy of the hippocampus a portion of the brain critical for memory processing Brain scans of people who have Alzheimers show that their hippocampi are considerably more shrunken than those of people of the same age without the disease Theres been less study though of possible shrinkage in the brains of cognitively normal people at risk for Alzheimers One reason is that until recently few interventions including drugs had shown much promise in slowing or preventing the diseases progression so researchers  and patients    have been reluctant to identify markers of its potential onset But then some studies began to suggest that exercise might affect the diseases progression A   for instance conducted by some of the same researchers from  the Cleveland Clinic found that elderly people with the e gene who exercised regularly had significantly more brain activity during cognitive tests than people with the e gene who did not exercise suggesting that the exercisers brains were functioning better But that study looked at the function not the structure of the brain Could exercise also be affecting the physical shape of the brain the researchers wondered particularly in people with the e gene To find out they asked the volunteers in their new experiment how often and intensely they exercised About half as it turned out didnt move much at all But the other half walked jogged or otherwise exercised moderately a few times every week  In the end the scientists divided their volunteers into four groups based on their e status and exercise habits One group included those people with the e gene who did not exercise another consisted of those with the e gene who did exercise and the other two groups were composed of those without the gene who did or did not regularly exercise  The scientists then scanned their volunteers brains with particular emphasis on their hippocampi Eighteen months later they repeated the scans  In that brief interval the members of the group carrying the e gene who did not exercise had undergone significant atrophy of their hippocampus It had shrunk by about  percent on average  Those volunteers who carried the e gene but who regularly exercised however showed almost no shrinkage of their hippocampus Likewise both groups of volunteers who did not carry the e gene showed little change to their hippocampus  In effect the brains of physically active volunteers at high risk for Alzheimers disease looked just like the brains of people at much lower risk for the disease said Stephen M Rao a professor at the Schey Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at the Cleveland Clinic who oversaw the study Exercise appeared to have been protective Meanwhile the brains of sedentary people at high risk appeared to be slipping structurally toward dysfunction  This occurred in a very compressed time frame said Dr Rao who described the differences in brain structure as quite significant How exercise was guarding peoples hippocampi remains unclear he said although the e gene is known to alter fat metabolism within the brain he said as does exercise which could be counteracting some of the undesirable effects of the e gene  More research needs to be done to better understand the interplay of exercise and Alzheimers disease risk But even so Dr Rao said theres good reason to tell people to exercise to protect their memories Many of us do not carry the e gene but everyone has some chance of developing Alzheimers disease  And if exercise reduces that risk in any way Dr Rao said then why not get up and move
