The very day I turned   of you wished me well on a decision to take the advice Id been giving others To leave a house I loved as one loves something animate not merely a construction of clapboard and stone before the inevitable crisis that would make it too hard to live there and also too hard to leave under my own steam My darling house belongs to somebody else now and a bit more than a month has passed since I bought an apartment thats nice enough  better than I expected really given the price I could afford With the new year here the days at their shortest and a couple of snowfalls behind me the time seems ripe to revisit this move  Did I do the right thing You betcha At the right moment Sure I did There are pluses and minuses upsides and downsides But Id still argue that anyone who waits much longer than I did to align her living circumstances to the inexorable march of time is kidding herself Anything is possible and you never know apply to much of life But Ive yet to meet anyone except on a movie screen or in a state of denial who doesnt get older every day  Absent a guarantee Id have died in my sleep while still able to walk up and down the stairs use a chain saw shovel snow and drive a car  to name just a few of the realities of suburban homeownership  waiting even a few years longer would have been folly   both physically and emotionally would have become geometrically harder with each year and impossible perhaps in an eye blink with one stroke of bad luck  So a tally of the experience still a work in progress in predictable and unpredictable ways I wish Id done a better job of culling my possessions leaving half again as much behind Im still living amid towers of boxes somewhat mitigated by my continued amusement at the moving companys name    I wish those boxes werent so heavy Ditto the furniture which the movers carefully placed where I wanted it until I changed my mind Or that I were stronger Or that the boxes didnt have to be broken down taped into bundles and shlepped ah ha to the basement along with garbage bags stuffed with the tissue paper enveloping every box of tea bags or can of soup I wish I understood the array of recycling bins in the basement new to New York City since my departure  years ago and commendable for sure Cans and bottles in clear bags Paper in dark ones Does this kind of new information keep the brain sharp like learning Sanskrit or doing Sudoku puzzles Because if it does I can consider my uncomfortable ignorance to be an Alzheimers preventive  I am baffled too by MetroCards swiping them on the train is a snap but the bus  not so much And those Muni Meters for parking  which way does the credit card go in Can you park there without paying on a holiday  This last actually required some investigation and the woman answering my  call surely thought me an idiot She kept repeating it was a parking meter holiday I was embarrassed to ask if these newfangled things   parking meters Since selling my car was No  on the Old Lady Moves agenda this was blessedly a shortlived confusion   I wish the bathroom wasnt so tiny I wish the southern light flooding my bedroom instead brightened the living room or office during the shortest days of the year I wish I controlled the thermostat so the apartment isnt either way too hot or way too cold I wish I could simply open the door to let the dog out rather than trade my pajamas for a parka at  oclock in the morning to walk him The dog Henry has made his own adjustments although he made them more nimbly than I At  years old hed always done his business on grass not pavement and he looked at me with bafflement the first time I took him out in the city After two days of sniffing hed picked his spots maybe yearolds in dog years are more open to new experiences than yearolds He figured out which doormen took unkindly to mess outside their buildings even if it was instantly scooped up Hes especially fond of urinating on a tree ringed with cabbage plants I wish he wouldnt but thought it more important to teach him not to wet the mound of blankets around the corner which turned out to be a sleeping homeless man I considered waking him to apologize but instead yanked the leash hard growled no in my best alpha voice and fled the scene It hasnt happened again  When the confusion of a move was ahead of me I was jotting every worry on a Postit lest I forget At what point do I sell the car Wheres the title Dog groomer Veterinarian  Well the car is sold I found a vet and I have a lead on a groomer Now after assembling two new watt lamps so heavy that the task was like bench pressing a chiropractor is at the top of the list But the appointment will have to wait until the remaining  boxes are unpacked  Also I need more BandAids for the damage caused by fumbled knives while opening those boxes And another bottle of Traumeel homeopathic magic for swelling and bruising when the hammer misses the picturehook nail and hits my hand instead  Clearly moving  like every other part of aging  isnt for sissies But I have more closet space than Ive ever had in my life and golden oak cabinets in the kitchen and bedroom that reach to the ceiling There are Bosch appliances that Im way too cheap to have ever bought for myself Central Park is four blocks to the west the East River promenade equidistant to the east Any kind of food is now delivered to my door my friends are a stroll or subway ride away movie theaters arent in malls and the superintendent cant do enough for me  Then theres the snow thing When I woke to gauzy whiteness the other day to the telltale sound of silence broken by the occasional grumble of plows I forgot where I was in that hypnagogic moment after sleep I dreaded the shovel the rock salt wet rag socks Frozen fingertips Slipsliding even with fourwheel drive to the A  P if I was out of milk  But no I live here now Somebody else shovels I walk to the corner for milk
