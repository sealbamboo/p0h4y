People hoping to find an allergyfree haven may be out of luck A new study has found that no region of the United States is allergyfree but the kind of allergy people are likely to suffer from varies by region race and socioeconomic status Researchers gave blood tests to  people  of them children under  to detect immunoglobulin E antibodies or IgEs The presence of an IgE antibody that reacts to a specific substance increases the risk of having an allergyrelated illness ike allergic asthma hay fever or rash  The scientists tested people for antibodies to a range of potential allergens including cats dogs milk cockroaches peanuts grass ragweed and shrimp No matter where they lived about  percent of people over  had positive tests for at least one allergen and so did  percent of the children  to  years old To me the biggest surprise is that the level of sensitivities didnt differ region to region said the senior author Dr Darryl C Zeldin a scientific director at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences This goes completely against what most people would have said The bottom line is that sensitization patterns differ by region but overall sensitization rates are high  Grass and ragweed sensitivities were higher in the West mold allergy more common in the East Positive tests for indoor allergens were higher in the East than the West but there were almost no regional differences  for peanut shrimp egg dog cat rat and mouse sensitivities The most common positive tests among the adult group were for dust mites grass and ragweed with almost  percent of the population showing sensitivity to each About  percent of people over  were sensitive to dogs or cats and among the youngest children milk and eggs were the most common positive tests Inhalant allergies like ragweed and grass peaked in the teens and s then decreased later in life Race and socioeconomic status also made a difference NonHispanic blacks had the highest sensitivity to all tested allergens except Russian thistle and egg Sensitivity to cockroaches and shrimp were associated with lower economic status and dog and cat allergies were more common in higher income groups In large metropolitan areas  percent of the population was sensitized to at least one allergen but only  percent in rural areas Outdoor allergens like grass and ragweed affected  percent of the urban population but less than a quarter of people in nonmetropolitan areas possibly because respiratory allergies are associated with air pollution The study   also found that allergies cluster in groups people sensitive to dust mites are also likely to be sensitive to grass and tree pollen sensitivity to peanuts usually considered a food allergy tends to cluster with plant allergies cockroach and shrimp sensitivity are a common pair probably because they contain a similar allergen a protein called tropomyosin Ganesa Wegienka an epidemiologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who was not involved in the research said that the paper provided a nice snapshot of whats going on in the US and she was especially impressed with the data on clusters of sensitivities This has implications for doctors and patients she said If a child is sensitized to one allergen in a cluster of allergens maybe the doctor should be looking at other allergens in the cluster to think about treatment plans
