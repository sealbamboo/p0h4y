Many observational studies suggest that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk for disease but it is not clear if low vitamin D is a cause or an effect of poor health Now a new study using a technique called Mendelian randomization provides persuasive evidence that low serum vitamin D itself increases the risk of death For the study   researchers used data from Danish government health records on  subjects All were tested for a genetic variant that reduces their vitamin D levels and  also had their vitamin D serum levels measured There were  deaths over the course of the study from  to   By studying two large populations of which one has the genetic variant for low vitamin D and the other does not researchers were able to virtually eliminate the impact of confounding factors like other diseases habits and behaviors that might be contributing to poor health These traits would be evenly distributed in the populations studied leaving only the genetic difference between them The scientists found that having the genes associated with lifelong low vitamin D increases the risk of cancer death by more than  percent and the risk of death from any cause by more than  percent They found no effect on cardiovascular disease death This study shows there may be a causal relationship between vitamin D levels and death said the lead author Dr Shoaib Afzal of Copenhagen University Hospital But he added We cant recommend that you go out and buy supplements We still need randomized trials for that
