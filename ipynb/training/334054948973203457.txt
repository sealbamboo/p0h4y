
 Dr Alfred J Tria is the chief of orthopedic surgery at St Peters University Hospital a bed facility in New Brunswick NJ and to the medical technology company Smith  Nephew his good word is worth a million bucks Well  to be precise Thats how much the company paid Dr Tria in fees for promoting its products and training doctors in Asia to use them from  to  according to disclosures required by the state of Massachusetts where Dr Tria is licensed In  Dr Tria earned  from private industry  more than any other Massachusettslicensed physician that year Dr Tria may be an outlier but gifts and payments to physicians from drug and medical device companies have been rampant in medicine for decades Over a twoandahalfyear period device and drug companies shelled out   according to a study published online this month in The New England Journal of Medicine That amount does not include outlays of less than  which are exempt from disclosure The companies treat doctors to dinner pay them to attend lectures and underwrite conferences and continuing medical education courses Asked whether such payments could pose a conflict of interest for physicians Dr Tria said Its a legitimate concern A spokesman for St Peters said Dr Tria had disclosed his financial relationships with industry to the hospital and refused to elaborate on the hospitals policy Information about these sorts of payments to physicians is available for the first time now in a handful of states that have passed laws requiring corporations to disclose payments to health providers Next year the data should be available nationwide when the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act goes into effect Corporations were supposed to start collecting the information last year For many decades we had no information  these were closely held industry secrets said Susan Chimonas of Columbia University who has researched industry payments to physicians We are just starting to get a sense of how much money companies are spending on the marketing and consulting arrangements The data will be a treasure trove for researchers For patients the question is what to make of this information and whether to seek it out when choosing a physician or making an important medical decision Orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and psychiatrists received the most lucrative payments the new study found Primary care physicians  such as internists and pediatricians  were least likely to receive payments In Massachusetts companies are required only to broadly categorize the purpose of the payments and nearly  percent of them were described as compensation for bona fide services Dr Aaron S Kesselheim an assistant professor at Harvard and the lead author of the new study says that though the reported information can be vague it can still be useful Its another piece of data for patients to examine as they consider treatment options he said If they go to an orthopedic surgeon who recommends a knee transplant and they go to another who recommends watching and   it might be interesting for the patient to wonder to what extent those two physicians have relationships with industry The question may also be appropriate if a physician changes a patients prescription for no apparent reason or prescribes a new or more expensive drug instead an older triedandtrue alternative said Dr Joseph S Ross an internist and assistant professor of medicine at Yale We know physicians are more likely to overprescribe or potentially prescribe inappropriately when they have a financial relationship with industry Dr Ross said His own research has found that   as long as theyre not too lavish The size of the gift is not a determinant of its influence experts say Even a small gift can generate positive feelings and influence attitudes and behavior I dont think doctors ever set out to make decisions that are not in the best interest of their patients said Dr Deborah R Korenstein associate professor at Mount Sinai and a coauthor of the study by Dr Ross But there are subconscious influences that people cant control and thats why patients and doctors need to be concerned she said A paper Dr Korenstein published in  found that more than a dozen expert panels that developed national clinical practice guidelines for managing   and high   were dominated by physicians with financial conflicts of interest  that is they were receiving payments from companies with an interest in how these diseases are managed Physicians often do not realize that they are being manipulated when drug companies offer to pay them consulting fees  for example for listening to pharmaceutical representatives describe new medications and evaluating their performance The real purpose is just to get the doctor to listen to the reps over and over again said Dr Adriane FughBerman director of   a project at Georgetown University Medical Center that focuses on the influence of drug company marketing Dr FughBerman advises patients to avoid physicians who see drug reps and dispense samples Ask Could I have a triedandtrue drug Could I have a generic versionÂ  Although many schools and hospitals have adopted new policies that guide interactions with industry they exempt physicians who are not staff employees and do not restrict the doctors income Tufts University Medical Center adopted a policy in  that required physicians to get approval and review if they were paid more than  in a year by a private company But a Tufts associate professor Dr Yoav Golan an infectious disease specialist was paid  by drug companies in  including  from Forest Laboratories  from Merck and  from Pfizer according to   A Tufts spokeswoman Julie Jette said the payments were approved by the university The policy wasnt intended to be a cap she said Dr Golan did not respond to an email requesting comment Dr Chimonas said she would encourage physicians and their professional groups to think about how all the information that is coming out is going to be interpreted or understood by the public Its so important for patients to be able to trust their physicians she said
