Its possible because of a kind of wearable robot  a fullbody apparatus developed by Californiabased Ekso Bionics Builtin sensors detect the users weight shifts and initiate steps Batterypowered motors drive the legs and make up for deficits in neuromuscular function  Linfoot is the first veteran to receive the Ekso suit for personal use  Its a gift made possible through a nonprofit organization focused on mental and physical issues facing returning veterans and their families  We were able to surprise the heck out a great soldier of ours Hes now marching around said Colin Baden president of   The symbolic walk signals Linfoots determination to move on  and the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty National Monument represents the freedom I fought for said Linfoot A highly decorated soldier Linfoot was a member of the US Armys elite th Special Operations Aviation Regiment Airborne During his th combat tour in Iraq his helicopter had a mechanical failure and crashed After just three months of rehabilitation Linfoot returned to duty as the officer in charge of the Special Operations Aquatic Training Facility Since retiring from service in  he has pushed hard to overcome limitations Linfoot now lives with his wife Mari in Clarksville Tennessee  He will provide crucial information to advance the technology of the bionic suit Its in limited trial use at hospitals and rehabilitation centers for patients with spinal cord injuries or those whove suffered strokes Creators of the Ekso suit predict the kind of rapid availability seen with other technology in recent years We definitely see opportunity to reduce the cost currently about  When you look back in time only a few people could afford the first cell phones Now the masses can enjoy that technology said   cofounder Russ Angold The idea was originally funded by the   the US Department of Defense agency that has a history of worldchanging innovations Today many entities are working to broaden applications of the wearable robot A team of engineers and medical doctors at   is working to enhance sensors in the suit that would make mobility possible even in difficult terrain Technology is developing not only to help people walk again but to help retrain neural pathways and mend the ruptured spinal column so that it can regenerate said GTRI Health Systems Technical Director Dr Shean Phelps a former special forces officer In this country some  million people  one in   live with some degree of paralysis according to a  report by the Christopher  Dana Reeve Foundation Actor Christopher Reeve who was outspoken about his resolve to walk again after a paralyzing accident died in  At that time the concept of the robotic exoskeleton was still in its infancy It was science fiction technology That is what we were working on said Angold Here we are less than  years later and were helping people walk again that otherwise couldnt And so weve brought science fiction to reality in a very short period of time Just five people in the world own Ekso suits One of the pioneers is endurance athlete Mark Pollack Though blind and paralyzed he recently set a record  walking the equivalent of a mile and a half in a onehour training session On this day a crisp clear afternoon in November Gary Linfoot stands his full  feet  inches tall and walks again  The site is significant on many levels The Statue of Liberty is a universal beacon of freedom and part of the National Parks Service which offers free yearround access to all national parks for disabled veterans   Being here on Veterans Day with New York City in the background  its very special says Linfoot It exemplifies hope for the future One day one day soon well be able to leave that wheelchair behind
