The budget President Obama will send to Congress Wednesday is expected to include some   and other health programs And if the word around Washington is correct it may also include a proposal aimed at winning some bipartisan backing  by   But there have been previous efforts to streamline Medicares antiquated system of deductibles and copayments And none so far has been successful Tom Miller a resident fellow at the conservative   says having separate deductibles and coinsurance schemes for Medicares parts A and B is an anachronism that dates back to the s when   Thats been a legacy which has been very hard to change he says because it requires an act of Congress which requires agreement  which tends not to be the case Currently Medicare Part A which covers hospital and skilled nursing home care and Part B which covers doctor and outpatient costs have   This year the Part A hospital deductible is  the Part B outpatient deductible is  Miller is one of many economists who say it would make much more sense to have a single merged deductible of around  That however would likely make many patients pay more Thats because most Medicare patients arent hospitalized in a given year but they   almost all go to the doctor Under most of the proposals floating around said Howard Bedlin vice president for public policy and advocacy at the   about  million beneficiaries would end up paying more and about  million would end up paying less In exchange however says Miller beneficiaries would likely get something they dont get now  stoploss protection That agreement for Medicare to cover all of a patients medical costs after he or she reaches a specific threshold is something the program currently  and almost inexplicably  lacks Thats the world in which you need insurance Miller says But Medicare traditionally doesnt have that type of structure Medicare actually did  briefly Congress added socalled   in  But it repealed it in  after an outcry from seniors who were outraged at being asked to pay for it Miller says the problem now however is that    either from a former employer or policies they buy themselves  that theyre not sensitive enough to the cost of the care they consume Theyre not facing enough incentives at the point of purchase to consider whether or not that  next visit to the doctor that next test might be worth the money if they were paying for some of it themselves as opposed to taxpayers paying for most of it he said Even worse said Miller the supplemental insurance companies have no incentive to economize either because theyre not footing most of the cost either  Medicare is Thats why some of the proposals being floated would no longer let private supplemental insurance cover those deductibles and coinsurance  and would require patients to pay at least some of the costs themselves But people like Bedlin say that logic is flawed Those tests economists talk about being overused Those are things that are ordered by the doctors he says Its not the beneficiaries who are choosing to take those And he says   that while making patients pay more does reduce unnecessary care it reduces necessary care as well And whats the implication going to be he said People delaying care they need ending up in the emergency room and ultimately costing the system more The bottom line however Bedlin says is that most Medicare beneficiaries just dont have a lot of extra money to spare Half of Medicare beneficiaries have incomes below  Very few of those get any help with costsharing  Id say only about  million out of that  million Even those who do have higher incomes already spend more of it on health care    on health care according to the Kaiser Family Foundation compared with about  percent for households without a Medicare patient That only proves yet again that everything in health care is more complicated than it appears
