Jackie Cartier of Boulder Colo has been running for  years That  has left her feet beaten up and bruised with thick calluses and the occasional missing toenail But she wont step foot in a salon to have a pedicure  I really need the calluses Ive built up said Ms Cartier  Whenever shes gotten the full pedicure treatment in the past she said those calluses have been removed And without that extra layer of protection her next few runs really hurt As for her toenails she says that shes embarrassed about the way they look But shell paint on top of however many nails remain some of them bruised and blackened and wear opentoed shoes anyway  Runners shy away from pedicures for a lot of reasons Not only may they want to preserve protective calluses they may also think having pretty toenails doesnt really matter when youre losing them so often Others are just too embarrassed to sit in a chair and have a stranger evaluate their battered feet Still others dont want to inflict any more pain on  nails that are already put through so much    Lost or discolored toenails are a perpetual problem for runners because running is blunt trauma on the feet said Dr Albert DAngelantonio an assistant professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Imagine if I beat on your skin a few times and hit you in the same spot he said You would get black and blue The same thing happens underneath the nail   Dr Ken Jung a foot and ankle surgeon at the KerlanJobe Orthopedic Clinic in Los Angeles likens the nail trauma that comes with running to stress fractures When the stress overcomes what your bodys able to handle you get stress fractures he said The same thing is true with the nail Its not the actual nail that is damaged but the nail bed the tissue under the nail that is rich in blood vessels Dr Jung says Running particularly running downhill or while wearing shoes that are too small puts pressure on the front of the foot and can traumatize the nail that protects that bed As a result the nail bed bleeds making the toenail appear black  The buildup of blood also creates pressure that can push up the nail The nail can then detach from the nail matrix the area at the base of the nail from which new nails grow For the majority of runners Dr Jung says that matrix remains unharmed Thats why often when a dead nail pops off a new one is already growing underneath After I ran the New Jersey Marathon I had seven and a half toenails  I say half because by the time one popped off half a nail had already grown back underneath  If the nail matrix is damaged however then the nail sometimes wont grow back That typically occurs after a more intense trauma I didnt start losing toenails until I was training for and running marathons but for some runners it can also occur when the toes jam against the front of an overcrowded tootight shoe or if the second toe is longer than the big toe Some ultramarathoners actually have the   to end constant pain Getting rid of toenails means they dont need to worry about the nails popping off in a race  Lauren Parker a yearold publicist in New York City uses pedicures as a treat  visiting a salon every time she finishes a marathon Shes run three so far Its my reward for putting my feet through a lot of training she said  While training for the race itself she keeps her nails trimmed and moisturizes her feet often That she said keeps my feet healthy not necessarily beautiful  Spas and salons have been catering to runners feet too As part of the Las Vegas Rock n Roll Marathon the Mirage Hotel and Casino last year offered a pedicure as part of a VIP package  Go Spa a St Louisbased salon has been offering the Perfect K pedicure for the last eight years A lot of our clients who are runners want that callus said Katy Oliver a spokeswoman for the salon So instead of sloughing them off the spa technicians leave them on They also cut the nails to a medium length   too short you risk ingrown toenails too long and youre more likely to bang the nail against the front of your shoe  The main benefit of a pedicure from a health perspective says Dr Jung is that it keeps the nails properly trimmed The nails should be cut straight across instead of rounded he said to prevent ingrown toenails  Of course you should take care to visit a salon that is hygienic in its practices  one that sterilizes its  tools including nail files and buffers Dr DAngelantonio recommends bringing your own instruments and also patronizing a salon that uses a plastic inlay inside of the soaking tub that the technician can replace after each customer to assure youre putting your feet in a sterile solution  And if you have an underlying medical condition like diabetes which can increase the risk of infection he says check with your doctor before getting a pedicure Ultimately theres not much people who run a lot can do to prevent lost or discolored toenails entirely Making sure your running shoes fit properly may help So can avoiding downhill running which jams your toes against the front of your footwear though thats not really practical  As for my own feet Im not embarrassed enough about my toenails to want to avoid my nail salon Right now I have my toenails painted American flagred  all nine of them
