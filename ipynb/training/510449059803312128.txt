Traffic jams are a part of daily life in Bangalore Whenever I visit my family there Im overwhelmed by it Each morning extraordinary numbers of buses cars rickshaws and bikes manage to squeeze onto the citys narrow streets until they all mesh into one chaotic mass Sometimes its hard to tell whether traffic is moving forward or backward The city has become a hub for Indias booming tech industry  but its roads and infrastructure havent quite kept up Last summer while trapped in a gnarly gridlock I witnessed the worst side effect of the citys traffic problems An ambulance was stuck The roads were so tightly packed and the commuters so determined to get ahead that it looked pretty hopeless It was only after  minutes and a lot of shouting from the traffic officer on duty that the ambulance finally got through This wasnt an isolated incident Last year an ambulance picked up a twoyearold girl who reportedly had low blood pressure and was having a hard time breathing The vehicle took two hours to reach a hospital nine miles away the     The girl died during the journey Every other day when you go on the street you see ambulances stuck says Dr Autosh Raghuvanshi the executive director of the Narayana Hrudayalaya a Bangalorebased health care company Its not just Bangalore Ambulance delays have been an issue in   and   as well This is a crisis situation Raghuvanshi says Thats starting to change says   an associate professor of medicine at Stanford University Indias first free public ambulance service called   launched in  Mahadevan helped train paramedics and develop guidelines for the program India is far ahead of where it was  years ago when taxis or private ambulances were the only option he notes But its still a work in progress Last year drivers and paramedical staff went   demanding raises and better maintenance for the vehicles And right now theres only one public ambulance per  people But Indias emergency programs are ahead of many developing countries Mahadevan notes Countries like Nepal Indonesia and Pakistan face similar problems In India theres a lot of experimentation with getting someone to scene as soon as possible Mahadevan says Here are some of the ideas being tested out In big cities like Bangalore the EMRI ambulances park themselves at key intersections during rush hour That way paramedics have a head start and can cut down their response time Right now it takes about  minutes on average for ambulances to reach patients says Jagadish Patil who manages the EMRI program for the Indian state of Karnataka We want to cut it down to  minutes In August Bangalore rolled out  motorcycle ambulances equipped with just an oxygen cylinder and a small medical kit the Times of India   Twowheelers can more easily slip though traffic so paramedics can reach and start treating patients more quickly Fully equipped ambulances may still need to trail the motorbike responders in cases where a patients needs to be transported to a hospital India isnt the first country to try out motorcycle ambulances Dr Reynaldo Holder a health care adviser for the PanAmerican Health Organization says hes familiar with their use in   and Colombia as well When theres traffic congestion they can get through the cars and even in some cases use the sidewalk he says Its good especially to navigate small narrow streets But its not a perfect system These motorcycle ambulances can get involved in traffic accidents because theyre moving too fast he notes And thats no help to anyone By Indian law cars are supposed to give way to emergency vehicles In reality that rarely happens And drivers rarely pay attention to lane divisions or speed limits When an ambulance does show up most drivers have a hard time figuring out how or where to pull over says B Dayananda a traffic commissioner in Bangalore So Bangalores traffic police are trying to reign in the chaos with a fun new campaign Billboards posted all over Bangalore feature   urging drivers to give way for ambulances Others feature   and   in single file lines If they can follow lane discipline why cant you the posters say Its still unclear how well these strategies will work Still Im looking forward to the day when Ill no longer have to worry about loved ones in emergency situation Mahadevan from Stanford says hes optimistic Give them some time to work through the kinks he says Emergency medicine in the US didnt happen overnight
