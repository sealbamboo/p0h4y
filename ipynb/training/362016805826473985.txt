The White House pushed back on Monday against allegations that healthcare reform is hurting jobs and the economy In fact the restaurant industry  given by many critics as the prime example of a place where jobs and hours would be cut if employers had to provide health insurance  is adding jobs said a senior administration official who spoke on condition that he not be identified Restaurants have had the fastest job growth among the industries and even faster than what would be predicted by their sales growth said the official In addition health care costs are slowing and by one measure inflation in health care spending is the lowest its been in  years says Council of Economic Advisers chairman Alan Krueger And to further make its point the White House posted a  extolling the virtues of health reform  The Obama administration has begun a full court press to  whose main provisions are just beginning to come into effect Republicans in Congress have been countering with hearings aimed at showing the legislations shortcomings and by making a show of voting to repeal the legislation or to prevent federal funds from being used to pay for it In sum data from across the economy  covering consumers government and private employers  point to the same conclusion health care cost growth has slowed Krueger   on the official White House blog  Prices for personal consumption expenditures PCE on health care goods and services rose just  percent over the twelve months ending in May  the slowest rate of increase in nearly  years Krueger writes PCE includes government and consumer health spending The senior official said the  Affordable Care Act was helping bring down these costs The law known widely as Obamacare has provisions to encourage hospitals to take better care of patients so they dont end up coming back again and again for complications The rate of these hospital readmissions has fallen to  percent slightly down from  percent in  the official said Spending on hospital services nursing homes outpatient services and drugs all grew at lower rates in the time period from March  to May  than in previous times going back to March of  the White House said And the official said the Affordable Care Act has not hurt jobs If the Affordable Care Act was slowing job growth then one would expect weaker job growth in industries that currently offer health insurance to fewer employees since these industries will be more substantially impacted by the employer mandate according to the official In fact since the private sector began adding jobs in February  job growth in these low coverage industries has been faster than the rest of the private sector Earlier this month the Obama administration  that anyone with  or more workers offer health insurance to any of them working fulltime The requirement defines fulltime as  hours a week or more  something constructed to make sure that employers didnt shave a few hours off fulltime workers weeks to avoid having to provide the coverage But many employers have threatened to cut both workers and their hours The state of Virginia already has done so  it has capped parttime workers hours at  hours a week State officials have said it would cost more than  million a year to provide them all health coverage Restaurants which employ many parttime and seasonal workers would be especially affected by the law and some restaurant executives have told Congress they will cut hours and jobs I suspect there will be some isolated instances the Administration official said but added there was no evidence such cases would affect the economy The White House also says one of the main plans of health reform  the health insurance marketplaces where people without insurance can buy coverage  are also turning out to be less pricey than critics had warned they would be In  states that have publicly reported premiums for  the average of the lowestcost plan is nearly  percent below projections based on Congressional Budget Office premiums Krueger blogs This includes New York State which recently announced that health insurance rates in  will be at least  percent lower on average than the plans currently available in the state
