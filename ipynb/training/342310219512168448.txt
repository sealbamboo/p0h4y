Are you more likely to sit less and exercise more if youve got a little device tracking you every step of the way Quite a few people think so But public health dogooders bent on getting Americans out of their chairs and off their couches want to know for sure Its high time they figured it out Stepmeasuring gadgets are flooding the market   is all the rage and employers from the   to private companies   wellness programs for employees around it Plus   associate professor in the department of kinesiology at Indiana UniversityBloomingtons School of Public Health says it has taken researchers a quite a while to appreciate how sitting for long periods of time affects to the body But now they do We are beginning to recognize that sitting without any movement may even be worse than not getting enough physical activity Johnston tells Shots She says many people dont realize how much time they spend sitting each day She recently completed a small study of four men and  women between the ages of  and  who completed a week test that involved wearing an Omron pedometer and getting nutritional and exercise tips by email She presented the research at the American College of Sports Medicines annual meeting While many researchers have measured the effect of pedometers on physical activity this study also tracked sitting time And the pedometers did seem to help people spend less time in their chairs Once given pedometers the study volunteers reduced their daily sitting time from  hours a day to  hours a day on average They also increased their their physical activity and lowered their body mass index Pedometers  and this one in particular  are good for people on the lower end of continuum who are very sedentary or just becoming active Johnston says The first time these people wear pedometers they are surprised by how little they move Then they enable the person to set goals The implications of a sedentary life increasingly look serious A  study   that men who sat more in their cars at their desks or in front of the TV were substantially more likely to die from heart disease Another study from  found that women over  who walked regularly had much higher odds of staving off disease and aging successfully than women who didnt A Mayo Clinic physiologist   that physical inactivity should become a mainstream medical diagnosis and that doctors need to do more to help inactive patients get moving As for pedometers Johnstons study is consistent with others including one   published in the in  which found that people who used pedometers had significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in BMI and blood pressure Unlike newer pedometer products like Nike Fuel  Band and Fitbit the Omron pedometer Johnston recommends doesnt have a builtin capability for social media sharing But Johnston says its the only one that has been validated as accurate by researchers and it doesnt require an Internet connection Its also cheaper at  compared with around  for a Fitbit or  for a Nike Fuel  Band Last month Fitbit started shipping the Flex a wristband pedometer that tracks steps distance and calories burned And market researchers predict wearable wireless health and sports gadgets will grow from  million devices shipped in  to  million in    the   But be careful about using any device while walking As   pedestrian injuries among people using devices are on the rise
