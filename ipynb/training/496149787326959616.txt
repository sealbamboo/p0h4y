It took three tries before Leslie ReidGreen found a suitable nursing home for her yearold mother Bella Solomon who has advanced   The first home her mother moved into was dreary and gray in an old hospital Ms ReidGreen said The staff wasnt very nice my mother hated it and it was far from where I live Frequent visits were an exhausting challenge The second home was a newer and much nicer facility though still more like a hospital than a home But the staff was unable to deal with her mothers aggressive behavior Within weeks the home sent her to a hospital where she was given antipsychotic medication She was returned to the nursing home but that stay lasted just a week or so followed by three months in a psychiatric hospital Ms Solomons behavior issues were finally stabilized and she returned again to the nursing home After another hospitalization for an infection she was placed on   The staff started ignoring her and failed to treat her   Ms ReidGreen said Finally in January after Ms Solomon had been on a waiting list for a year and a half a bed became available at yet another facility the Parker Home in Piscataway NJ closer to Ms ReidGreens home in Flemington Despite costing significantly less than the other two homes Parker has a homier atmosphere an attentive and pleasant staff and a more serene environment Ms ReidGreen said They take her outside the other residents seem content theres no smell of urine in the hallways the residents are treated with respect and even aides from other wings say hello to her by name Dogs are brought in for pet therapy and children visit the residents Ms Solomon no longer needs antipsychotics which are poorly metabolized by older adults and often overused The takehome message More expensive is not necessarily better Ms ReidGreen said Her experience and similar ones reported by other families emphasize the importance of thorough footwork well in advance of the need to place a loved one in a nursing home Nearly half of the residents in   are there because their dementia primarily   has reached a point where caring for them at home has become unsustainable They may wander from home not knowing how to return or even who they are or awaken many times a night causing mayhem and exhausting their caregivers Falls fires poisonings selfinjuries and physical aggression often become everpresent dangers The important message to families Its not a sign of weakness  more likely a sign of strength  to move a loved one with advancing dementia to a nursing home But it isnt easy to find a place that offers the services and environment that the patient needs Simply having a specialized dementia unit is not enough The   There are different levels of dementia and people with it have different needs Joanna R Leefer the author of Almost Like Home a guide to choosing a nursing home said in an interview Although most nursing homes now have a dementia wing theyre not all good she said I had to move my mother three times before I found the right place for her where my father who didnt have dementia could live too She found one home for example that was pleasant enough Yet people in the dementia unit primarily sat around Ms Leefer said My mother needed a lot of   and space to walk around Ms Leefer recommends looking for a place with different levels of dementia care As the disease progresses a residents needs will change The nursing home must be able to adapt to those changes Some people with dementia benefit from stimulation but overstimulation including a noisy environment can make others agitated and aggressive Some homes rely too heavily on   or antipsychotic medications to calm aggressive behavior experts say   can be triggered by factors like pain anxiety hunger or the need to toilet Ms Leefer wrote Before assuming that sedatives are the only solution a doctor should assess any possible underlying factors that might be triggering or aggravating a patients symptoms She lists six crucial questions to ask when assessing a nursing home for someone with dementia One of the biggest challenges involves patients who wander While some facilities lock the doors to residents rooms or even tie them to their beds others use a more humane approach Wander guards worn by patients set off an alarm when they stray too far Of course all doors to the outside must be locked at all times The   offers an extensive    for finding an acceptable nursing home at The list describes desirable characteristics of the building and its environment including the facilitys services room designs meal arrangements and recreational activities It discusses the appearance of residents their access to trained staff the staffs demeanor with patients and of course location and costs But no matter how good a home might be experts say that continued family support and involvement are critical to assuring good patient care Plan to spend several hours with the patient on the day of admission when anger hurt and acting out are likely Visit often on different days and times and get to know the staff Finally if the facility you choose does not offer
