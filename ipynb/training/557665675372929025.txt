The brains of adults who have elderly parents diagnosed with Alzheimers disease betray troubling hallmarks of the same disease even in middle age when the memory and mental skills of these grown children are still perfectly normal a new study finds  published Wednesday in the journal Neurology finds that Alzheimersrelated abnormalities were most pronounced in the brains of those with two parents suffering from the disease But among those having just one parent afflicted with Alzheimers dementia less severe abnormalities were evident Those unusual features followed differing patterns depending whether mother father or both had been diagnosed But the findings fell in line with previous research suggesting a persons risk of developing Alzheimers in old age is greater when his or her mother has had the disease than when his or her father has None of the  subjects who underwent magnetic resonance imaging or MRI scans and two types of PET scans showed any behavioral signs of suffering from Alzheimers Their ages ranged from  to  with an average of  and all had at least  years of education The researchers recruited  subjects who had a mother diagnosed with the disease after the age of   who had a father diagnosed with lateonset Alzheimers and  who were unlucky enough to have two parents diagnosed with the memoryrobbing disorder A final  subjects with no family history of Alzheimers served as a comparison group Scattered evenly through all four groups were  subjects who were carriers of the APOE genetic variation that confers a higher risk of Alzheimers Compared with the nofamilyhistory group the motheronly group and the fatheronly group those with two Alzheimersaffected parents showed the most reduced overall metabolic activity in their brains and the greatest shrinkage of gray matter in several regions strongly affected in Alzheimers disease The brains of those with any family history of Alzheimers also showed more substantial amyloid plaque deposits than did those without a family history of the disease But subjects with two parents affected showed the most amyloid plaque  a key hallmark of Alzheimers Even when the researchers created a smaller group of younger subjects  the  who were under   they observed the same patterns of abnormalities However the researchers  from New York University School of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College  said they could glean no relationship between APOE status and early signs of brain abnormality in the children of Alzheimers patients While dispiriting news for those who have watched their parents minds robbed by Alzheimers the new research may aim at something more hopeful By detecting and characterizing the earliest signs of Alzheimers risk studies like these may allow physicians to identify those who could benefit from therapies to prevent or delay progression of the disease long before it begins to affect cognitive function While no therapy for prevention of Alzheimers is yet in hand researchers and Alzheimers activists are putting heavy emphasis on the hunt for an agent or strategy that could nip the disease in the bud possibly decades before it manifests itself as confusion and memory loss Chief among them are agents that can disrupt the process of betaamyloid buildup in the brain either by improving the brains trash removal systems or blocking the chemical process that allows them to form In an   in late December Dr Denis A Evans a neurologist at Rush University Medical Center wrote that a shift in emphasis toward Alzheimers prevention seems warranted given the swelling numbers of those at risk and the discouraging record of progress in finding therapies to reverse or cure Alzheimers If they are to identify such a preventive therapy however they will need first to identify and track those most at risk  possibly by looking for the earliest changes in brain structure and function that are forerunners to dementia symptoms
