New research published today   confirms what scientists have been telling us for some time now the later you stay up the more sleep you lose the more calories youll eat and the more weight youll gain In a firstofitskind experiment sleep researchers from the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania found that when test subjects went to bed at  am and woke four hours later at  am they consumed about  calories after  pm far more than their bodies needed In addition more of those  calories came from fat resulting in a weight gain on average of about  kilo  pounds after five consecutive nights of limited sleep Research over the years has produced similar findings but the new Penn study is significant because it used  people And because the research took place in a lab scientists were able to control for a variety of factors  Andrea Spaeth a doctoral candidate and the studys lead author called the logistics a nightmare but worthwhile because it increased the power of the results  Spaeth said participants in the study could eat almost whenever they wanted and as much as they wanted Meal sizes did not differ between baseline days and the five experimental days or between the sleepdeprived group and a small control group But the deprived group ate more times through the day and shifted their calorie intake toward late night she explained The next morning theyd actually eat less  AfricanAmericans were especially vulnerable to the effects of sleep deprivation AfricanAmerican men gained the most weight about  kilos or  pounds followed by AfricanAmerican females and white men both just under  kilo or  pounds and white women almost onethird kilo or  pounds This is the first racial difference in such a study explained Kenneth Wright associate professor in the department of integrative biology and the director of the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder This provides experimental evidence for what we see in the epidemiological literature that AfricanAmericans seem to be more influenced by the effects of sleep loss Why that is and why exactly anybody gains weight with sleep loss is still somewhat mysterious Wright explained In an   his lab found that key hormones regulating food intake like ghrelin and leptin were within normal levels in sleep deprived people but they still ate more  It could be he speculated that control centers of the brain  ie willpower  are weakened causing us to seek rewarding pleasurable food which could explain why we tend to eat fattier food late at night Were seeking comfort But there are other factors at work too We have biological mechanisms to prompt us to consume more energy when were awake Spaeth said But such evolutionary adaptation does not account for the fact that modern man in western society no longer has to hunt down an antelope or dig up a tuber to get food All we have to do is open the refrigerator What were doing is really overcompensating for small increases in energy requirements This is partly why shift work can be so detrimental to health Wright said Shift work goes against the fundamental biological clock in our brain We evolved to be awake during the day when we are supposed to be physically active and consuming food When we are awake at night the circadian clock does not adapt There are consequences to thatThats why shift workers are at greater risk for many health problems we see in modern society Shift work isnt going away any time soon though Wright said finding ways to compensate for this circadian havoc is a key goal of chronobiological research
