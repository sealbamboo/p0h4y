When it comes to reining in health care spending it still seems like each hospital administrator thinks the guy at the other hospital should do it Hospitals are still racing to offer expensive new technology  even when it hasnt been proved to work better than cheaper approaches Case in point   a hightech radiation treatment for cancer The local government in Washington DC is on the verge of approving two proton beam facilities at a total cost of  million The centers would be owned by the two dominant hospital systems in the area Johns Hopkins Medicine and MedStar Health Meanwhile the Maryland Proton Treatment Center is already being built  miles away in downtown Baltimore Both Hopkins and Medstar have been pleading their cases before a local health department committee that grants hospitals the right to build new buildings and services Hopkins documents are   and MedStars are   And both health systems argue that the nearest proton therapy centers are too far away for Washington residents to use We believe that this therapy is absolutely necessary but we also think that its appropriate to be applied to certain types of cancer with certain treatments and not everything says Chip Davis president of Sibley Memorial Hospital where the Hopkins proton center would be built The center would open in  and would   in profits by  But not everyone agrees with Davis that more proton therapy centers are needed Neither Hopkins nor MedStar should be building says Dr Ezekiel Emanuel a former health care adviser to the Obama administration who is now at the University of Pennsylvania We dont have evidence that theres a need for them in terms of medical care Theyre simply done to generate profits The higher costs of proton services ultimately trickle down to taxpayers employers and consumers in the form of higher health insurance premiums Its hard to bend the cost curve when youre spending a lot of money says Emanuel These are tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in treatment for interventions that do not improve survival improve quality of life decrease side effects or save money There are already  proton therapy centers in the US and the Maryland Proton Treatment Center in Baltimore is one of  more on the way The Baltimore facility is a giant cementencased building the size of a football field with a price tag of more than  million Its being funded by forprofit developer Advanced Particle Therapy At its heart sits a ton piece of equipment called a cyclotron which accelerates protons until theyre whizzing around at twothirds the speed of light The stream of protons is then directed at a tumor delivering a blast of radiation The idea is that the proton beam is so focused that only the tumor gets irradiated protecting the surrounding tissues and minimizing side effects Baltimores treatment center will be staffed by physicians from the University of Maryland Radiation oncologist   who will direct the center says hes hopeful that the technology could be used to treat up to a quarter of all cancers At the end of the day when I face a patient and I tell a patient I can treat you with technology that will treat less of your normal tissue with radiation you dont need versus more radiation to the tissue that should not be radiated which would you like to choose Mehta says The vast majority of patients will choose the technology that gives less radiation to their tissues Studies suggest that proton therapy   who have brain and spinal tumors protecting fragile developing organs that are near the cancer and preventing future developmental delays and secondary tumors But childhood cancers are rare and theres not much clinical evidence that proton therapy is better than standard radiation for most other cancers The particular proton technology used at the Maryland center something called spot scanning hasnt undergone any randomized clinical trials at all Mehta acknowledges Nonetheless he says the center will treat about  patients a day at a cost twice that of standard radiation The group he suggests includes patients with prostate lung abdominal and other cancers Mehta estimates that  percent of the patients treated at the center will be adults and up to  percent will be prostate cancer cases A   published in the   in December however found that prostate cancer patients who received proton therapy fared no better than those with standard radiation treatment despite substantially higher costs Its hard to find a lot of children with brain cancers you can treat with the device but you can find millions of men with prostate cancer says   a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School And because the centers cost so much to build and operate a high patient volume is the only way they can afford to stay in business But the University of Marylands Mehta argues the studies that show disappointing results for prostate cancer are based on flawed data and dont reflect the true value of proton therapy Doctors at the University of Maryland say their proton center is more than enough for all the patients living around Washington and Baltimore Theyve even invited specialists from both Hopkins and MedStar to practice there Thats unlikely to happen A committee in Washington has recommended that both proposed centers be allowed to proceed A final decision from the agency director is expected soon
