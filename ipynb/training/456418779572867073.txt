Theres something unsettling  freakish even  about Lawrie Browns photos of everyday meals In one photo the Californiabased photographer has placed a shockingly blue raw chicken atop a bed of rice and peas In another pink cereal puffs float in a sea of yellow milk And Brown slathers three hefty scoops of green ice cream with purple fudge in a third with bloodred cherries as garnish Other photos in her   feature green corn blue crackers and green spaghetti These dishes are familiar but their natural colors have been swapped for bizarre tones Instead of roast chicken food porn Brown gives us an unappetizing alienlooking chicken And the pure white were so used to seeing in the cereal bowl has been replaced with a sort of yellow goop Some of these colors like the blue on the chicken and the   are latex paint But the pink cereal the green ice cream and the   were sold in those eyepopping colors Brown says the project came about as she started hearing about food additives and the more she learned the more fascinated  and repulsed  she grew It got to the point where I didnt think I could make a good purchase at the grocery store she says Health advocacy groups   theres mounting scientific evidence linking artificial food dyes to behavioral issues in children The Food and Drug Administration   probing that link To help people become more aware of food dyes Brown got out her camera bought some paint and looked for food that was conspicuously dyed along with tableware to create a typical American table setting As far as the colors I wanted something kind of whimsical and colorful and bright and sort of a contradiction to what was going on in the background Brown tells The Salt While the painted hues in Browns images are intense theyre not that far off from the colors in the products we see every day in the grocery store Just think of blue MMs and energy drinks and yellow Skittles But making food more fun isnt the only reason for the preponderance of artificial dyes in processed food We actually taste food first with our eyes says   an experimental psychologist specializing in the perception of food at Oxford University And thats what food companies hope to appeal to when they coat food in brilliant jewel tones Visual cues kind of have precedence and can set up expectations about what it is we think were going to taste and what the flavor will be he says And those expectations tend to be a very powerful determinant of what we actually experience For example different shades of red can make us perceive food as  percent   than it actually is Green tends to make us think the food will be sour And blue can make us turn away in disgust which may explain our reaction to Browns blue chicken There could be an evolutionary reason behind this Spence says Fruit turns from green to red as it ripens so our ancestors associated red with sweet and green with sour And blue food isnt as common in nature unless were talking about bluishgray meat which usually signals spoilage In fact Browns blue chicken is reminiscent of a wellknown experiment from the s in which steak and fries were served under a special lighting that made the meal look normal The participants enjoyed it  until researchers revealed under normal lighting that the steak had been dyed blue and the fries green Just like that their appetites were gone But the response isnt always disgust Sometimes our brains may enjoy the surprise Think back to  when food manufacturer Heinz introduced its notorious green and purple   Spence says The funky colors may not have been popular with adults but kids loved it  even if it was only for a short time Indeed Brown says that different people had different reactions to her photos  particularly the one with the green ice cream with the purple toppings I had one person say that they just love grape toppings and then I had another person that found it disgusting she says Spence says its hard to imagine a world without food dyes We even alter the   by varying the feeds for chicken If anything he says we might see a shift toward natural food coloring The   might just get its day in the sun
