Plans to improve care for patients in hospitals in England at weekends have been commended by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh is expected to announce an increase in the number of senior doctors working weekends It comes after a yearlong inquiry into NHS care following concerns over higher death rates on Saturdays and Sundays Labour said the government must set out clearly how the plan would be paid for Sir Bruce is expected to outline the plans on Sunday In a   interview he warns hospitals that they could face multimillionpound penalties if they fail to keep up their standards at weekends Xray ultrasound CT and MRI scans will be carried out as promptly at the weekend as during the week the paper reports Sir Bruce also proposes to stop the practice of care being provided at weekends without consultants being present  hospitals that refuse could face losing their right to use junior doctors He tells the paper Historically at the weekend our service has been delivered largely by junior doctors in training and now we are changing that Meanwhile a group of senior consultants have called for proper staffing of NHS wards at weekends  Last year a study by the Royal Society of Medicine found patients were  more likely to die if they were admitted on a Sunday than midweek The research looked at both emergency and planned admissions Mr Hunt said Patients should be able to depend on the NHS every day  not just Monday to Friday  I want the NHS to expand to provide sevenday services so that more patients get the best care when they need it  It is great news that Sir Bruce Keogh will shortly be setting out his plans for the NHS to provide sevenday services Dean Royles chief executive of the NHS Employers organisation said Sevenday working is probably the most important issue facing the NHS at the current time and movement in this direction is essential if we are to ensure its sustainable longterm future The NHS cant afford to sit back and rest on the laurels of its year history We are increasingly seeing hospitals and communitybased health services develop innovative services that anticipate and respond to patient needs but all too often NHS employers find the terms and conditions of doctors are getting in the way of progress We are now facing a onceinageneration opportunity to change how the NHS works Patients employers medical royal colleges and the government all want to see sevenday care Andy Burnham shadow health secretary said the idea was right in principle but called for more detail about how it would be paid for It would not be progress if it is achieved by closing smaller AEs or raiding other services such as community or mental health services This would take the NHS in the wrong direction  forcing even more people into hospital when the future demands more care in the home he said He said the government should urgently stop the cuts to frontline staffing  Things will not get better unless the government first stops the rot he added NHS England declined to comment on the review ahead of its publication Meanwhile in the open letter published in the Telegraph eight surgeons raised concerns that patients were being put at risk because inexperienced hospital staff were being forced to take on too much responsibility It follows the treatment given to one of the consultants retired surgeon Russell Hopkins whose aftercare following a hip operation in June  failed him catastrophically the surgeons wrote Mr Hopkins a former British Medical Association Wales chairman was left with nerve and bladder damage after being left for days without seeing a consultant as his condition worsened  They said surgery was too large and technical for a shift system of junior staff  In the letter the consultants called for a return to the system that predated the working time directive which limits surgeons hours with doctors organised into firms Many surgeons yearn to put ethics before directives and to practise these oldfashioned fundamental values they wrote Health boards and council social services in Wales have produced joint plans for the first time this year to manage winter pressures while officials do not rule out seven day working as part of an overhaul Dr Grant Robinson the Welsh governments clinical lead for unscheduled care said radical changes were needed to the system Sometimes there are some big game changers   seven day working is a radical change that as the potential to help Last month   It followed a call by Scotlands health secretary for more to be done to make sure the NHS provided the same service at weekends as it did during the week  Alex Neil said five health boards would pilot new approaches in a m trial He has also committed to having consultants in wards seven days a week
