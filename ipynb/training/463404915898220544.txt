Relief is in sight  and it wont involve a lawsuit  for the four counties in Colorado that have the the   Obamacare health insurance premiums in the country Local officials in the ski resort region in the mountains west of Denver had   over the high rates But on Friday Colorado Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar said she wants to redraw those boundaries making the resort counties part of a much larger county pool The Affordable Care Act sets a lot of limits on what insurers can do They cant charge sick people more for instance But one thing that still counts is location location location Premiums can be higher or lower based on how much doctors and hospitals cost in a specific area And states get to draw those geographic boundaries When Colorado lumped the four resort counties together it created the   in the US almost by accident It is about fairness Salazar said explaining the new boundary When we put the resort counties together we didnt know what the difference and disparity was going to be We found out pretty quick Thats a switch from what Salazar said in December when she argued that it wouldnt be fair for some of the states poorest counties to subsidize its richest by lumping them together in the same risk pool Resort county commissioners like Dan Gibbs welcomed Salazars proposal The status quo was killing our middle class he said But if redrawing the rating map has the effect Salazar predicts resort county residents will still have some of the highest ACA premiums in the country The current premium for a yearold nonsmoker in the resort counties is  a month Salazar says her best guess is that rates would drop   percent in those counties bringing the premium down to between  and  a month Rates would go up in the nonresort counties Salazar says prices could rise  percent which would drive the cost of a comparable plan up from  a month to about  The new   of premiums and what drives the costs has some county officials meeting with local hospitals to at least study costs and look for strategies to bring them down Resort county hospitals have long worked with local elected officials and businesses to bring health care costs down says Steven Summer president of the Colorado Hospital Association Thats ramped up as a result of the transparency around new premiums he says Summer also says labor and supplies are significantly more expensive in resort areas Theres a higher cost in maintaining the surge capacity they need to care for tourists seasonally Summer says Hospitals have to stay open and pay staff yearround even though theres little demand much of the year You cant just flip a button and be ready he says Talk about rates for next year is pure speculation until June  when insurers have to submit proposed premiums for  So far theres been no backlash from people in counties whose premiums are likely to rise Commissioner Salazar is taking public comment until Wednesday and plans to issue a decision Friday Beyond next years rates another announcement Friday will surely influence health care prices in Colorados resort area Kaiser Permanente the states dominant health insurance company said it will enter the western Colorado market in  Kaiser hasnt said which towns it will serve or to which facilities it will send members for care but increased competition could drive prices down
