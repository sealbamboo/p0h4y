Women with lowrisk pregnancies are to be encouraged to have nonhospital births   which could see almost half of motherstobe planning to deliver their baby away from traditional labour wards Guidance from National Institute for   and Care Excellence Nice says that midwifeled care has been shown to be safer for women and recommends that all women with lowrisk pregnancies   of the total  should be advised that giving birth in a midwiferyled unit whether attached to a hospital or not is particularly suitable The changes published on Wednesday  have been made because women who give birth under midwifeled care have less chance of being asked to undergo medical interventions such as episiotomies caesareans and use of forceps or ventouse Susan Bewley professor of complex obstetrics at Kings College London and chair of the Nice advisory group added that infections were more common on hospital wards Were supporting an individual calm conversation about what is right for each individual in her circumstances Bewley said They may choose any birth setting and they should be supported in those choices as thats their right The   body also advised midwives not to clamp and cut a babys umbilical cord until at least a minute after birth in the absence of complications and generally within five minutes The announcement reverses decades of NHS policy and   Research suggests that   risking anaemia In separate guidance on postnatal care Nice said parents should also be informed about the association between falling asleep with their baby on a bed sofa or chair and sudden infant death syndrome until the baby is  months old The change represents another significant change to the guidelines issued in  which   Parents should also be informed that the association may be greater if parents use drugs or have recently drunk alcohol or if the baby was of low birth weight or premature Nine out of  of the  babies born in England and Wales each year are currently delivered in hospital under the supervision of obstetricians Nice added that commissioners should ensure that women have all four possible options for giving birth available to them hospital care midwifery units in hospitals midwifery units based in the community and at home Professor Mark Baker Nices clinical practice director said Its very difficult to explain why this is happening but the closer you are to hospital and indeed if you are in hospital the more likely you are to receive hospital care and surgical interventions Surgical interventions can be very costly so midwiferyled care is value for money while putting the mother in control and delivering healthy babies The outcome for the baby is the same in different settings except in the case of firsttime mothers giving birth at home where there is a small increase in risk of serious complications  nine in every  compared with five in every  in the other settings  which the guidance says mothers should be advised about Home births are the cheapest followed by midwifeled units and then hospitals but Bewley said costs did not come into the equation Cathy Warwick chief executive of  said For lowrisk women giving birth in a midwifeled unit or at home is safe and reduces medical interventions We hope this will focus commissioners and providers of maternity services attention on ensuring that women have a real choice about where they give birth The RCM has been campaigning for about  extra midwives to be recruited Warwick said the new guidance would not stretch existing medical staff further but ensure they were better employed as more women would have births without interventions which require more resources Elizabeth Duff senior policy adviser for  welcomed the advice and urged the NHS to put these guidelines into practice as soon as possible and make home and community birth a real not just theoretical option Community midwife units have lower medical intervention rates and rates of transfer to obstetric wards than those in hospitals but   For women not giving birth for the first time they also have a lower rate of transfer to an obstetric ward than mothers who planned to give birth at home
