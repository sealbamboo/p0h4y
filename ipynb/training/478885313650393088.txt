Hello, everyone, and how are you today? A shiny sun is warming the Pharmalot campus, where the birds are chirping, the official amascots are watering the weeds and a short person is getting ready for another day of learning. As for us, we are immersed in the usual rituals – foraging and phoning around. We trust that you relate. So please join us as we quaff a cup of stimulation and get on with the day at hand. Hope yours goes well and do stay in touch…. The headlines this morning includes pieces about retracting a Pfizer study, a new cream for eretile dysfunction and lawsuits over Xarelto. Also, having fended off Pfizer, at least for now, Pascal Soirot is talking up prospects for AstraZeneca.
