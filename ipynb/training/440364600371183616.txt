Infant sleep machines designed to soothe baby with sound are popular with harried parents but they could end up harming babies hearing according to a new study Researchers tested  widely available machines that play white noise and other soothing sounds for an article published Monday in the journal Pediatrics At one foot away three of the machines produced such intense sound levels at maximum volume that if played through the night they would exceed   for adults at work Used too loud or too close or too long these machines can exceed safety standards and potentially damage the hearing of the infant Dr Blake Papsin the lead researcher and chief otolaryngologist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto told NBC News And those sound limits may be too liberal for infants whose ears differ from adults says Papsin The infant ear has a little straighter tube Its a little wider open and it amplifies the higher frequencies At distances of one foot and three feet the maximum volume on all the devices exceeded the more conservative recommended noise limit for infants in hospital nurseries and at   feet  of the devices did so The study only looked at the potential for harm No one knows how parents actually use these machines and there have been no hearing studies of infants exposed to them But the researchers recommend that parents play the machines as quietly as possible as far from the baby as possible and for as short a time as possible Or maybe not use them at all None of our sleep specialists recommend them says Papsin who suggests that parents address underlying noise issues and help baby sleep by reading books or singing lullabies The researchers recommend that manufactures lower the maximum volume include automatic timers to shut off the devices and insert printed warnings about noiseinduced hearing loss The researchers did not reveal the names of the tested machines and several individual manufactures declined to comment In a statement the USbased Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said its members welcome any and all information that will advance the safety and well being of children and use that information when applicable in the safety and design of products
