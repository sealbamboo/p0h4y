For thousands of people across the country going to a regular gym just doesnt cut it Instead they prefer CrossFit routines like swinging kettlebells flipping tires and doing squats and dead lifts until they drop Now kids as young as  are taking part The idea behind   says cofounder Jeff Martin is to pair fitness and fun Since he started the program with his wife Mikki in  it has taken off There are hundreds of CrossFit Kids classes across the US and more in cities across the world When   in Rockville Md opened classes for kids about two years ago it was the first of its kind Now there are dozens in the DC area alone The owner Justin Bacon explains there are three classes for different age groups one for  to yearolds another for  to yearolds and another for teenagers The kids version isnt exactly like the adult classes On a recent visit its a circuit of pushups pullups and squats A few months ago the focus was on learning dead lifts and an Olympic lift known as clean and jerk Owen Belamaric  is not so sure about CrossFit When I ask him what it is he doesnt like he says the workout  its always really hard Which raises the question is it good to make the workout hard for kids That depends on your definition of hard In terms of weightlifting the scientific opinion has changed in the past few years  is a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City and author of   Metzl says when people think about strength training for kids the initial thought is Are you crazy Kids should not be lifting weights But he and many other sports medicine specialists are convinced that strength training can be great for kids That idea gained momentum in  when the American Academy of Pediatrics revised its   The AAP used to recommend against weightlifting but after considering new research it determined its safe for kids to start a light weightlifting routine after age  Metzl explains that kids who strengthtrain wont look like mini Schwarzeneggers  that type of bulking up doesnt happen until after puberty The muscles dont look better they just act actually a lot stronger and it is very helpful for them Metzl says Some of the kids do say they feel stronger Nicole DoriaRose brings her two sons to the CrossFit DoneRight class in Maryland on Saturdays The little one likes it because he feels like hes getting stronger I asked him in the grocery store to help carry some bags the other day and he said Oh I can do this and I do CrossFit  she says At first DoriaRose was skeptical about weightlifting for kids Ive read about kids teenagers starting weightlifting too young and getting hurt because  their bodies arent mature enough to handle it but at this level theyre doing just a little bit of the weightlifting and theyre really teaching them how to do it properly she says The problem is that some kids push themselves more than they should which means proper form can be compromised Last month yearold Sean Cooper set a personal record with an pound dead lift That kind of exercise worries   a former power lifter and director of the Sports Medicine Biodynamics Center at the University of Cincinnati He says there is no evidence that CrossFit is good for adults let alone for kids   The people who most use this type of training are people like military people Navy SEALs and we dont even have any data thats even highly effective in highly conditioned people like that Hewett says He says some CrossFit trainers arent teaching appropriate techniques for weightlifting or are trying to supervise too many athletes at once And that could be dangerous What kids are attempting to do is Olympic lifts like a snatch or a clean and jerk and they dont have the power to properly perform the exercise to bring it up to their shoulders and then bring it over their head So theyre grabbing this thing at their waist and theyre trying to twist and turn their torso which is putting their spine at significant risk with weights that are greater than they can handle The best way to train kids according to both doctors is with high repetition lightweight training Kids should be able to do eight to  reps of whatever weight with no problem Metzl who just launched a kids strength training education project called   with the AAP explains that for kids to reap the benefits of strength training they dont need to push too hard Were not looking for full muscle fatigue at all Metzl says There have been a number of studies that compare highrepetition lightweight training to lifting big weights for a short time to bulk up muscles and surprisingly the strength benefits are almost equivalent between the two Of course Hewett says kids should be incorporating activity into their daily lives and that will keep them in shape Doing things they like to do getting out into the park into the playground playing relatively lowimpact sports and doing that throughout their childhood and hopefully throughout their lifetime Hewett says So if your kid wants to do CrossFit and the class has good trainers thats just fine But if your kid prefers doing cartwheels outside to lunges indoors thats fine too The point is to make exercise fun and a part of everyday life early on
