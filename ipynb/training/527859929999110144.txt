Encouraging greater integration between the NHS and social care systems     is like motherhood and apple pie Noone would argue against it The line where NHSfunded healthcare ends and councilfunded social care begins has always been blurred and failings on one side undoubtedly have an impact on the other So the idea of getting social care workers to join up with health staff such as district nurses physios and occupational therapists to provide sevendayaweek support in England has been widely welcomed In fact some of the more innovative areas have been pioneering it for a while What the governments bn Better Care Fund is doing is focusing national attention on the issue and probably helping to accelerate it That is good news for the vulnerable patients  many of them elderly  who benefit from this sort of help to keep them living independently in their own homes and out of hospital and care homes But there is an elephant in the room that noone in government wants to talk about in much detail Its the funding situation A popular saying in the sector is that combining two leaky buckets does not create a watertight solution The phrase was used by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens in his   after he started in post in April It refers to the fact that both health and care are facing a tricky financial future The bn funding gap predicted for the health service has been much discussed  only last week NHS England   how it could be bridged But social care is also facing its own funding shortfall A   published earlier this week by the Local Government Association and Association of Directors of Adult Social Services put it at bn That may not sound much compared to what the health service is facing but in terms of the overall budget it is a similar proportion In fact councils argue they are only managing to keep the service afloat at the moment after talking some very difficult decisions About bn a year is being ploughed in to social care from cuts to other services such as leisure centres and libraries  But this on its own has not been enough Councils have also had to ration care by raising the eligibility criteria Four years ago over a quarter of councils were providing help to those with moderate or low needs now it is nearer one in  are That means you have to be sicker or even more frail to get help What is more social care is meanstested If you have over  in assets you will not get any help from the state It has meant that at a time when the numbers getting help should be rising because of the ageing population the reverse has happened Over the last four years the numbers getting help has fallen by a quarter to just over m So what does this mean for the governments plans In short the impact will be limited according to many experts  Age UK has been quick to point out that the money being set aside for this accounts for less than  of the combined NHS and social care budgets  The result is that the Better Care Fund will just affect a small part of the health and care system It will entitle people to a single assessment   a common complaint is that people have to repeat their stories to the NHS and social care system  and help when it is most needed such as immediately after being discharged from hospital or when a persons condition worsens and without extra support they may need to go to hospital or a care home What it does not really address is the ongoing support that many of these people need on a daily basis such as the help with washing dressing or eating  For that they will still need to fall back on social care but in the words of the Councillor David Sparks chair of the LGA which after all represents the councils who run the system that continues to let down the very people it is designed to help
