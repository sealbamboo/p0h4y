I sometimes wonder when Ill run out of ideas for beets as year after year around this time Ive devoted a weeks worth of   But it hasnt happened yet Beetroots whether roasted steamed or raw easily find their way into new salads side dishes and main dishes They are friendly with Mediterranean seasonings of all kinds Greek Middle Eastern North African Italian and Provenal The greens are interchangeable with other mildtasting greens like Swiss chard and spinach one bunch of beets gives you two vegetables to work with With the beets and their greens you get two sets of nutrients anthocyanins and betalains known for their antioxidant properties from the beetroots and vitamins K and A as well as other phytonutrients  lutein and zeaxanthin  from the greens Both are excellent sources of folate and beets are a very good source of manganese potassium and copper I find that I often need greens from two bunches to have enough for a recipe which is one reason Im always looking for new dishes for beetroots This week I made three vegan salads one with beets and their greens drizzled with a garlicky tahini dressing that Ive always loved with typical Middle Eastern dishes like deepfried cauliflower and falafels I combined beets with fennel and orange in a crisp refreshing salad and with wild arugula and herbs in another I made a Greek phyllo pie with beets and greens and a gorgeous beet pure with yogurt and North African spices But pretty much every beet dish is gorgeous
