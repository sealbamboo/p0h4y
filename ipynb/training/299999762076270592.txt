Its another case of a beautiful idea colliding with some ugly facts The beautiful idea is the notion that clearing the blocked artery of a stroke patient with a device snaked right up to the blockage would salvage threatened brain cells and prevent a lot of disability A lot of stroke patients in the US are already getting this   withintheartery treatment because the Food and Drug Administration approved the devices without clinical proof that they work Medicare has begun paying for the treatment But now come those ugly facts Three studies have now found no difference in outcome between patients who got the endovascular treatment along with an intravenous dose of a clotbusting drug called tPA or Alteplase and other patients who got only tPA There wasnt really clear evidence that endovascular therapy added to tPA  was better overall than tPA as the standard treatment Dr Joseph Broderick   MedPage Today It was hard to detect a signal of benefit in the studies that were presented Broderick who led the   was referring to disappointing results presented this week at the International Stroke Conference in Honolulu Hes research   at the University of Cincinnati Stroke specialists will be chewing on the findings for months and perhaps years to come But the first guess about why the arteryclearing devices didnt improve outcomes is that patients didnt get the treatments in time After all the endovascular procedure cant be started until after intravenous tPA is tried first and that can be as long as fourandahalf hours after the first symptoms of stroke Even a onehour delay in the time to treatment negates the benefit of a higher rate of artery clearance   of the Medical University of South Carolina notes in an   accompanying online publication of the three studies in the   Chimowitz was referring to an   of  stroke patients called SYNTHESIS Expansion Dr Brian Silver of the Rhode Island Hospital Stroke Center agrees that the disappointing outcomes were probably due to the passage of too much time Its not sufficient to just open up the blood vessel it has to be done early on Silver   in an interview with MedPage Today There was a hint in Brodericks study called   that outcomes might be better if tPA can be started within two hours of stroke onset and endovascular treatment within  minutes of that But that kind of speed is almost impossible to achieve consistently in the real world It takes time to gather the specialized personnel needed to do the fancy imaging tests and then perform the delicate endovascular procedure safely Not to mention that many stroke patients arent lucky enough to live close to a center that can muster the effort quickly Speaking of fancy imaging a   nicknamed MR RESCUE tested whether CT or MRI scans could identify patients most likely to benefit from endovascular treatment based on the amount of brain tissue at risk from the blockage but not yet dead Many of these patients have large blood clots in a major artery of the brain and tPA doesnt always dissolve these blockages But alas even patients who seemed to have the most favorable scans had the same level of disability at  days whether or not they had undergone the clotremoval procedure or had received standard therapy   the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke which funded the MR RESCUE study So whats next Given the   there will be more studies to figure out how to improve outcomes for patients who arent being rescued with tPA alone Some will involve new clotbusting drugs and devices But Broderick tells MedPage Today that some of these studies are not paying enough attention to how quickly the therapy is delivered And none is big enough by itself to provide good answers And many worry that it will be difficult to recruit stroke patients and their doctors into studies that randomly assign them to receive tPA alone or in combination with endovascular treatment Thats because the endovascular devices are so widely used Maybe Chimowitz says Medicare will have to declare a moratorium on paying for endoscular therapy until these urgently needed trials are carried out That ought to stir up some lively debate
