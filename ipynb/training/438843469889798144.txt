Traditionally research has focused on womens biological clock But in recent years scientists have been looking more and more at how the fathers age at conception might affect the baby too A study   Wednesday hints that age really might matter  in terms of the childs mental health Researchers from Indiana University and the Karolinska Institute found that compared with children fathered by men who were  years old kids born to dads who were  or older were three times as likely to have autism and  times as likely to have ADHD Kids born to older dads were also more likely to go on to develop substance abuse problems and get lower grades in school The findings appear in  Paternal age may have a stronger effect than we previously realized says Brian DOnofrio the studys lead author and an associate professor of psychology at Indiana University To figure out how paternal age was related to childrens psychiatric health the researchers looked at millions of parents in Sweden who had children between  and  The researchers took into account the mothers age as well as other demographic factors that might play a role in the childs cognitive development and mental health Theres a growing body of literature that suggests that advancing paternal age is associated with a host of problems   tells Shots Another   published in   last month found that the children of older fathers seemed to be at greater risk for developing schizophrenia and autism DOnofrio and his colleagues paid special attention to siblings and cousins and found that even among kids in the same extended family a dads age when his child was born made a difference Most previous studies with   had compared children born to unrelated families DOnofrio says and that made the earlier results harder to untangle Men who tend to become fathers at a young age can be very different from those who choose to have kids later in life he says For example older dads as a group tend to be more educated and wealthier By comparing kids within the same extended family the researchers were able to account for such differences in their current work The results are in line with a growing body of research linking older fatherhood with various developmental problems in children This study gives a bigger picture says   a professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York who wasnt involved in DOnofrios study but researches similar issues The older age of dads is associated with not just one disorder or another but with a large number of adverse developmental outcomes he says However the study looks only at how paternal age and childrens mental health are associated  its a correlation Reichenberg cautions not a proven causal link Scientists havent yet determined the mechanisms of the effect But it doesnt seem to be simply a matter of overdiagnosis among the children of older parents the scientists say Other research has found that as men get older their sperm cells are more likely to contain random mutations that might theoretically contribute to disorders like autism in their kids Other environmental and   factors could also be at play Reichenberg says It could be that kids with older dads tend to grow up in different environments than the kids of younger dads The epigenetic argument Reichenberg says postulates that an environmental factor can activate or deactivate something in the genome Previous studies have looked at this phenomenon in animals Ultimately men and women of all ages he says should remember that age is only one of many factors influencing the developing babys health The most important thing is that future mothers and fathers should still go ahead and have children even if the father is older than  or  Reichenberg says Most of these children will be absolutely fine DOnofrio agrees that men and women who arent ready to have kids in their s shouldnt fret too much Delaying childbearing also enables people to become more financially secure complete more education he says And that has a positive effect on children Its routine for doctors to remind women older than  that there are risks associated with older motherhood Reichenberg says So should be the case maybe for fathers
