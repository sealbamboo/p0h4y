Many experts and parents believe that exposing preschoolers to music makes them smarter  that is gives them an advantage in cognitive development in other areas But two new randomized trials have found no evidence for the belief In one trial  yearolds accompanied by their parents attended six weekly minute classes on musical arts and a matched group of  attended classes on visual arts  In a second test  yearolds and their parents were assigned to music classes and  to no classes at all Children living with professional musicians and those already taking music lessons were excluded and there were no significant differences between the groups in age family income ethnicity parents level of education and other factors The   Researchers tested the children after the classes were completed for skills in spatial linguistic and numerical reasoning but found no differences between the groups The authors acknowledge that they used only one music curriculum and that a trial with a different kind or intensity of training might produce different results  We should be very cautious in making positive claims about cognitive benefits of music lessons said the lead author Samuel A Mehr a doctoral candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education He added We should teach music because music is important
