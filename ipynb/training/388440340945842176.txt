If a new study from a team of Oxford researchers holds up men hoping to attract the woman of their dreams had better work on their kissing In the surveybased study published today in the Archives of Sexual Behavior women declared kissing to be much more important than men did  so important theyre more likely to change their opinion of a mans desirability based solely on a kiss  Using an online survey technique polling  men and  women between the ages of  and  Rafael Wlodarski and Robin Dunbar of the department of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford found that people used kissing as a way to judge a potential mate and to help establish and maintain a bond but not to become sexually aroused    Why people kiss has long interested scientists  In primates its a social bonding tool according to Frans de Waal the CH Candler professor of primate behavior at Emory University and one of the worlds leading experts in primate society  Kissing among apes is common most often used as a greeting or a means of conflict resolution de Waal said In chimps the kiss often resembles a toothy gnaw on a shoulder though sometimes on the mouth too Bonobos are even closer to what you would call human kissing he said More open mouth put on anothers mouth sometimes including tongue action But its more a playful thing not so much a sexual thing After kissing primates whove been arguing calm down and reestablish friendly relations When a member of a primate troop has been gone and returns other members often kiss it  Kissing evolved goes the prevailing theory by the transfer of food from the mouth of a mother to the mouth of babies  But why do people do it To find out the Oxford researchers asked people to rate their own sexual attractiveness their sociosexual styles  short term and onenights stands versus looking for a longterm partner  and gender Then they were asked to indicate in which situations they kissed and how important kissing was  When they sifted through all the answers the researchers concluded that kissing wasnt really used as a way to create sexual arousal but was used to judge the value of a potential sexual partner and as in primates to help establish or maintain a social bond Women were especially attuned to kissing quality In answer to the question Have you ever felt attracted to someone only to find that your attraction to them had changed after an initial kiss the results showed that women were more likely than men to have experienced a change in attraction after an initial kiss  The more attractive the woman the more likely she was to have changed her mind if a kiss wasnt up to snuff  Furthermore women valued having a partner who was a good kisser more than men More kissing and more satisfaction with that kissing as well as more sex in the relationship were all positively associated with relationship quality A growing number of studies are showing that when two potential mates are close to each other they unconsciously exchange a great deal of information about genetic fitness health and fertility Immune system compatibility information is passed in human pheromonal cues Wlodarski said possibly in saliva but more likely by scent Kissing in many cultures can take the form of sniffing or inhaling the other I would guess that this is the more likely mechanism which allows individuals to assess potential mates  Studies have shown that women can detect some immune system information from men through smell And men can detect when women are ovulating Neither gender is aware but for example female strippers earn higher tips when they are ovulating Close contact through kissing could help that exchange Massage eye gaze touching have all been shown to engage oxytocin and reward brain circuits relieving anxiety and increasing trust  Kissing in established relationships probably works to strengthen bond between individuals via these types of mechanisms Wlodarski said by establishing trust intimacy and the release of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides like oxytocin and dopamine Thats probably why even longmarried couples who often touch and kiss even if theyre not having much sex report good relationship satisfaction That may also be why the people in Wlodarskis survey reported much more kissing before sex rather than during sex or even after sex It was not to get aroused but to feel relaxed and intimate
