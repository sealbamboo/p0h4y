A newer form of mammogram may do a better job of finding cancer a study finds But the technology is still too untested to know if its going to be useful for most women or even to know for sure who might benefit Its called breast tomosynthesis or D mammography Since being   by the Food and Drug Administration in  the new type of scan has been touted by radiologists I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this technology for your mammogram today   the website of a radiology practice in Washington DC D mammography is helping us every day to find more early curable breast cancers But so far there has not a lot of evidence to back up the claim of superiority As a result many insurers arent paying for it If a woman wants a   shell probably have to pay  or  out of pocket to have the extra scan added to a conventional mammogram And shell get an extra dose of radiation in the process Adding the D technique increased the cancer detection rate from  to  per  patients according to data presented Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago And it reduced false positives from  percent to  percent according to   a professor of radiology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center who led the study It really addresses a lot of the criticism of   by the US Preventive Services Task Force and others Conant tells Shots In  that panel   that women under age  not get mammograms because of the high rate of false alarms The decision was  by many in the cancer and womens health communities Conventional mammograms are far from perfect missing about   according to the National Cancer Institute Mammograms also deliver a false positive result about  percent of the time which means women have to undergo more testing and the anxiety that goes with it Conants team looked at results from  women who had D scans at Penn in  That year the hospital started using the technology on every woman who walked in the door for a mammogram They then compared the findings with results for  women whod had standard digital mammograms at the hospital the year before It wasnt a randomized trial And the results could be better because the first time a new test is used it typically picks up cancers that were missed by the old technology After that the success rate often drops Still Conant is enthusiastic Its an exciting platform she says I would highly recommend seeking out tomosynthesis Other breast imaging experts arent so sure The gains seem to be modest in both directions says   a diagnostic radiologist at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center Is this something that will prove to be worth the additional time expense and radiation exposure I think that Dr Conants study is encouraging but its not the definitive study We need to wait and see if the next round shows the same benefit and whether we can figure out if its for everybody every year says   a professor of radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis Theres been speculation that women with dense breasts may benefit more from D mammograms because the usual mammogram isnt good at seeing through dense tissue Standard mammograms take two images of each breast one vertical and one horizontal In a D mammogram the Xray machine swings in an arc to take about  millimeterthick images The radiologist then views them like a digital flipbook That should up the odds of spotting tiny tumors But there are as yet no data showing D really is better for dense breasts or whether some other subgroup of women might benefit more from this technology I think it will get worked out eventually Monsees tells Shots Right now women have to get both a regular mammogram and the D version which means they get a double dose of radiation Thats still within safe limits Conant says though not ideal Update  am The FDA   an application from Hologic Inc manufacturer of a D scanner for a software module to make D images from a D scan This would reduce womens radiation exposure Tomosynthesis is not the beall and endall Conant agrees Instead she hopes its the beginning of an evolution toward more precise personalized breast cancer screening In November the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services posted an FAQ stating that breast tomosynthesis should be included in the cost of regular mammography for Medicare patients which may pressure private insurers to start paying for it But that wont necessarily make womens decisions any easier I cant give you a Yes you should no you shouldnt  Lee says of whether women should go D at this point When she started doing mammography  years ago Lee says there were no other choices Now women can choose sonograms MRIs and various flavors of Xray screens Unfortunately the more tools we get the harder it is to know which ones to use
