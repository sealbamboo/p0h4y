Fifteen years after they have weightloss surgery almost a third of patients who had Type  diabetes at the time they were operated on remain free of the metabolic disorder a new study says And six years following such surgery patients had shaved their probability of suffering a heart attack over the next  years by  their stroke risk by  and their likelihood of dying over the next five years by  additional research has concluded The two studies both presented Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery in Atlanta offer the first indications of weightloss surgerys longerterm health benefits for patients While researchers have demonstrated dramatic improvements in many bariatric patients metabolic function in the short term the durability of those improvements has been unclear Research suggests that over several years many bariatric patients regain some of the weight they lose in the first two years  a fact that has raised doubts about the costeffectiveness of the surgery which can cost  to  for the initial procedure plus a wide range of costs to treat complications after surgery The new studies findings that patients health prospects remain better for several more years may make weightloss surgery a more appealing treatment for insurers to cover and for obese patients with health concerns to seek out The study that followed  bariatric patients in Sweden for  years found that in the first two years after surgery  achieved diabetes remission They were able to cease taking medication for the metabolic condition After  years a little more than half of those had diabetes again But  had remained in remission By contrast only  of the comparison group  similarly obese patients with diabetes who did not get surgery  had seen their diabetes remit in the first two years At  years out diabetes remission was six times likelier in those who had surgery than in the those who did not In another study researchers at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio followed bariatric patients for an average of six years after surgery They tallied those patients likelihoods of developing a wide range of health outcomes at the time of surgery and six years later and compared them To do so they used the Framingham risk calculator to estimate the beforeandafter year risks of heart disease stroke death kidney disease and complications such as diabetic retinopathy and poor circulation The Framingham risk calculator is derived from probabilities gleaned from following more than  subjects in Framingham Mass in the Framingham Heart Study which started in  In this study the bariatric patients lost  of their excess weight and  saw their diabetes remit after surgery Overall their risk of having coronary heart disease stroke or peripheral heart disease dropped by  Bariatric surgeon Dr John Morton a professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in either study suggested that the results of more modern bariatric surgical procedures may be superior He added that reducing the stress of obesity on the body even if some weight returns may improve a patients longterm health prospects Carrying extra weight can carry forth year to year said Morton who is presidentelect of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery He likened longterm obesity to smoking cigarettes for years suggesting that the number of years a person remains obese or smokes may interact with their degree of obesity or how much they smoke to influence his or her likelihood of developing health problems Any removal of that extra weight and inflammation is a help Morton said A previous version of this post incorrectly said the new studies on weightloss surgery were presented at the Obesity Societys annual meeting They were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery The two groups both were meeting in Atlanta as part of an event called Obesity Week
