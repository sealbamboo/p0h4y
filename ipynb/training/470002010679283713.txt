There was a time when people drank because they were thirsty People in desk jobs didnt give hydration much thought beyond refilling their coffee mugs Throughout most of the th century marathon runners were discouraged from drinking during exercise for fear it would slow them down writes Dr Timothy Noakes professor of exercise science at the University of Cape Town and author of Waterlogged Noakes notes that those athletes did just fine It was only during the mids after the widespread appearance of the first sports drink  Gatorade named for the University of Florida football team  that the pendulum swung A recent investigation by BMJ formerly the British Medical Journal concluded that in the decades that ensued the sports drink industry promoted hydration by sponsoring scientists who advised sports medicine organizations which then developed hydration guidelines Thirst quenchers In the May  Saturday section an article about hydration products said that the Bai brand of beverages has nine flavors There are  flavors Also they are sweetened with stevia and erythritol the article mentioned only erythritol  Athletes were urged to drink as much as possible before they sensed thirst Sports drinks were encouraged for anyone who broke a sweat And the advice trickled into mainstream culture I recall that when I first came to the University of Connecticut in  no one carried water into the classroom Now one out of three students carries a water bottle says Lawrence Armstrong a professor in the universitys Human Performance Laboratory He attributes the proliferation of watertoting students to a media concept explosion on drinking eight glasses of water per day Its not that drinking water or sports drinks for that matter is bad Water is the main component of the human body making up  of its mass After three to six days without water a person will die Studies have shown that even mild dehydration affects mood and cognitive ability  giving credence to the eightglassesofwater advice says Armstrong who was one of the studies lead authors But Institute of Medicine guidelines state that most healthy people can meet their daily water needs the oldfashioned way by letting thirst be their guide And though sports drinks can offer benefits to athletes exercising at high intensities or for long periods of time the average person or recreational athlete doesnt need a sports drink says Armstrong The human body is proficient at maintaining homeostasis adjusting electrolyte balance to stay within optimal range so its unlikely a healthy person would hit a sodium deficit under normal conditions Plus the high sugar content of many sports drinks can significantly increase daily caloric intake Still the nonprofit IOM estimates that adequately hydrated people drink  to  liters about  quarts to a gallon of fluids each day And  comes from food
