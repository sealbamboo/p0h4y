When it comes to the history of vaccines its been a long bumpy ride Once hailed as lifesaving wonders of modern technology vaccines are now more likely to be a source of suspicion and angry playground debate 
                   
                  Will we ever agree on the risk and benefits of vaccines Probably not 
                   
                  But to sort out fact from fiction Healthcom took a look at the scientific research to date on vaccines 
                   
                  Thimerosal a preservative containing about  mercury prevents contamination by bacteria It can be found in most flu shots according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC 
                   
                  However since  thimerosal has not been present in routine vaccines for children younger than  And both the flu shot and some vaccines for adults and older children can be found in thimerosalfree versions or with only trace amounts 
                   
                  A small  study by Andrew Wakefield claimed to find a link between the measles mumps and rubella MMR vaccine and autism setting off a panic that led to dropping immunization rates and subsequent outbreaks 
                   
                  Since then the studys been deemed flawed and its been retracted by the journal that published it In  the Institute of Medicine released a report that found no scientific evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism In September  the CDC published similar results 
                   
                  Its more risky for your child to not be vaccinated says Carrie Nelson MD chair of the Commission on Health of the Public and Science for the American Academy of Family Physicians 
                   
                  Vaccines arent risk free The most common side effects are soreness at the injection site and fever which are best treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen Less common are seizures defined as jerking or staring and risks   For example  in  children suffer a seizure after receiving the DTaP shot its  in  with the MMR vaccine 
                   
                  Some kids are at higher risk for side effects than others In these cases it may be best to   
                   
                  Unfortunately thats a big   Often likeminded unvaccinated families by choice attend the same preschools playgroups and schools thus making it very easy for vaccinepreventable diseases to spread says Ari Brown MD pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics 
                   
                  Dr Brown says this was true with outbreaks in San Diego and Boulder Colo And some people cant be vaccinated due to health or age restrictions Plus you can catch some germs like tetanus and hepatitis A from contaminated soil or food not another person 
                   
                  Vaccines are not a  guarantee you wont get sick But they are a huge help 
                   
                  Take the flu vaccine you may still get the flu if you get the jab but it is likely to be less severe Or take the chicken pox vaccine Dr Brown says it is  effective against preventing infection and  effective in protecting against serious illness 
                   
                  For the best protection experts rely on herd immunitythe more people who are vaccinated in the population the better chances of protecting everyone including people who cant get shots due to age health or religious reasons 
                   
                  Dr Brown says its quite the contrary Each dose allows the body to mount an immune response and make defense antibodies so the body can fight off a real infection if it showed up she says 
                   
                  Children are given multiple vaccinations at a time to provide as much protection as early as possible Both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that vaccinations be given to children simultaneously when appropriate 
                   
                  There are numerous vaccines that can help keep adolescents and adults both young and old healthy Most obvious is the flu shot which is given annually 
                   
                  College students should get a meningitis vaccine before living in a dorm and elderly adults can benefit from pneumonia vaccines 
                   
                  Adults also need boosters for tetanus and pertussis Children arent fully immunized against pertussis until age  Dr Nelson says smaller babies are at high risk and pertussis can be transmitted to babies by adults with waning immunity 
                   
                  There are two HPV vaccines Cervarix for girls and women  to  and Gardasil for females  to  But Gardasil can also be given to boys and men between ages  to  according to the CDC Gardasil protects against types  and  of human papillomavirus which cause about  of all genital warts 
                   
                  Dr Nelson says she recommends the HPV shot to patients but its variable Its like a  split Still she says girls definitely receive it more often than boys 
                   
                  According to the CDC approximately  cases of genital warts occur each year in the United States 
                   
                  Well this is partially true According to the American Academy of Family Physicians pregnant women should not be given vaccines for varicella chicken pox or MMR 
                   
                  But the inactivated flu vaccine is safe and even recommended for pregnant women Dr Brown says During pregnancy womens immune systems are compromised making them more susceptible to infection 
                   
                  But many are not getting the flu shot the CDC says that at last estimate only  of pregnant women got one Dr Brown says the shot triggers the mothers antibody production protecting her baby through the first six months of life 
                   
                  Dr Nelson says infections are more likely than vaccines to trigger lifelong immunity An exception is the flu it changes strains every year But you may think twice about taking your little one to a chicken pox party 
                   
                  The problem with natural immunity is the risk of complications Chicken pox can lead to encephalitis pneumonia or if kids scratch too much skin infections like MRSA A polio infection can cause permanent paralysis mumps deafness and   type b Hib brain damage 
                   
                  Those are the chances people take if they defer the vaccine Dr Nelson says 
                   
                  The only infectious human disease that has been eradicated worldwide is smallpox according to the World Health Organization WHO Even today there are outbreaks of conditions like measles mumps and pertussis 
                   
                  Vaccines can protect you when youre around those who arent vaccinated either in the US or elsewhere According to the WHO less than  of people in many parts of Western Europe receive vaccines and thats where  of measles cases occurred in  
                   
                  Vaccines arent a cash cow for docs Its probably more of a money loser than anything says Dr Nelson because theyre labor intensive Some doctors do receive financial incentives from HMOs but the bonuses are there to support highquality practice and help the physicians justify the manpower that goes into administering them she says 
                   
                  Vaccines are about  of total pharmaceutical revenues says   a website run by the Penn Center for Bioethics Weve had problems with vaccine supply because so few pharmaceutical companies are making vaccines anymore Dr Nelson says Three decades ago more than  companies produced vaccines today about five companies account for  of the market
