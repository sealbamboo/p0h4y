Scientists claim they have evidence that explains why lifestyle changes known to be good for you  lowfat diets exercise reducing stress  can lengthen your life Based on a small exploratory   researchers say these good habits work by preventing chromosomes in our cells from unraveling Basically they assert that healthy living can reverse the effects of aging at a genetic level Its all about the little caps on our chromosomes called   They work like the plastic tips of shoelaces to protect the ends of chromosomes the strings of genes in the heart of every cell that tell it what to do Without telomeres   Scientists have been fascinated by telomeres for several decades In    an author of the new study shared a Nobel Prize for pioneering work in the field As people and other animals age their telomeres get shorter and shorter  a wellgrounded observation that some scientists think is not only a marker of aging but a fundamental driver of   Study author   of the University of California San Francisco notes that things that are bad for us accelerate the shortening of telomeres Smoking makes your telomeres shorter and emotional stress is associated with shorter telomeres and lack of exercise Ornish says And we know that shorter telomeres are associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases and a shorter lifespan Ornish is known for his work showing that heart disease in particular can be not only prevented but reversed by rigorous changes in diet exercise and stress reduction In recent years he and his colleagues have focused on the hypothesis that telomeres are at the root of these healthpromoting changes They studied two groups of older men One group didnt do anything special the other adopted Ornishs healthy regimen These included a whole foods lowfat plantbased diet thats also low in refined carbohydrates Ornish says Walking for a half an hour a day Doing various stress management techniques including yoga and meditation for an hour a day And spending more time with their loved ones including friends and family After five years study authors say men who followed this regimen actually lengthened their telomeres by about  percent Men who didnt had a  percent shortening of their telomeres over that period The big caveat is that this was a small study  only  men in the betterlifestyle group and  in the status quo group Moreover  of the  in the healthyliving group actually had telomere shortening while  of the  others had telomere lengthening Ornish says thats apparently because some men assigned to the group for improved lifestyles didnt follow it as well while some in the comparison group actually did adopt healthier habits Ornish says the research team expected that men with better habits and longer telomeres would also have higher levels of an enzyme called   that maintains telomeres But curiously they didnt Despite this puzzle the small numbers of men involved and what researchers would call the crossovers between the two groups in their behaviors Ornish says the results are statistically significant and consistent He believes the findings are real and their implications profound If your telomeres get longer then your life is probably going to get longer and youre going to have a lower risk of developing a wide variety of conditions Ornish says And since its the same lifestyle intervention that weve found could actually not only prevent but even reverse the most common chronic diseases like heart disease earlystage prostate cancer Type  diabetes etc it makes sense Others in aging research are intrigued but its going to take some convincing Certainly everyone in our field will agree that telomere length is telling us something says   of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City But its still not clear what telomere length  or lengthening  means Barzilai says And the new study doesnt answer that either At the end of the day this hasnt stopped any argument Barzilai says Either youre healthy so you have longer telomeres or you have longer telomeres and thats why youre healthy You can pick and choose what you believe in and make an argument For instance Barzilai has shown that centenarians have longer telomeres than yearolds But he thinks the centenarians telomeres are longer because theyre healthier not the other way around But   of the National Institute on Aging finds the new study intriguing He studies the effects of telomere shortening on immune cells Can we demonstrate that cells with shorter telomeres have weaker immune function The answer from our data is yes Weng says But I dont believe the telomere is the only parameter that determines aging There are many other things Apart from scientists fundamental disagreement about the role of telomere shortening or lengthening theres something else that troubles many of them Its not only healthy cells that have longer telomeres So do   In fact that may be what keeps them dividing out of control So some researchers worry that interventions that lengthen telomeres  not healthful diet and exercise necessarily but perhaps a drug with that effect  could promote cancer My sense is that the cancer problem is a really really big problem says   of the   in California which funds aging studies The implicit hope is that cancer either will not be stimulated in the manner that many people think it will Or else even if it is that well find ways to get around cancer somehow So far concerns about cancer have not chilled some companies from pursuing drugs and nutraceuticals that can lengthen your telomeres And the new study preliminary as it is seems likely to encourage that quest
