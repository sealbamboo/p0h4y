Theres a photograph I know that shows a kids bicycle lying on its side one wheel turned upright a smear of blood tracing its path on the concrete Theres a little package still latched to the back waiting for its owner to return You can see where the bike swerved then lost its way Someones been hurt Or worse The blood is still damp the trail fresh Whose blood was it A childs I imagine  from an accident A shooting The photo was taken by   during a war in Yugoslavia Its called  Sarajevo  and the picture doesnt just invite you it compels you forces you to ask   The thing that gets me about this picture is its grip Annie Leibovitz finds exactly the right framing the right angle the right distance to tell me some  but not all  of what I want to know The bicycle the blood the ground what I see what I cant see makes me imagine a story I have to imagine because while there are clues in plain view what I am really looking for  a victim a perpetrator an explanation  is missing Or so it seems So I keep looking I cant stop Great radio reporters can do this too they take you somewhere show you some but not all of what they saw and you wait stuck in your driveway unable to stop listening stop imagining until you find out what you suddenly desperately need to know Theres a difference of course Leibovitz grabs your eyes We grab your ears But its the grab that matters I am fascinated by storytelling glue Anytime I see someone whos good at it I stop and wonder howd they do this Why cant I tear myself away Thats what I wondered when I saw this image from sculptor   Its a home surrounded by a perfect circle of destruction  a kind of ground zero in reverse the center is intact everything else ruined Look more closely you can see the house is small the little girl lingering in the garden is she the only survivor comes from a model railroad set Shes maybe a halfinch tall This scene the house the garden the girl the vast tangle of debris could fit on a dining room table where you could sit down at it like an Olympian god And unlike the Leibovitz picture with the Doyle sculpture you can change your point of view looking from on high or crouching down low choosing any angle you like But however you look Doyles scene like Annies photograph is carefully designed to focus on the same question What just happened Doyles work is about mystery Why was this one house this one circle of space spared Why a circle Why so precise so neat so tidy a circle You probe for clues But Doyle creates moments that confess nothing Time for him is his glue His scenes are frozen locked into a moment You cant move forward to find out what happens next You cant go back to find a cause You are stuck in the Now And there is no answer to the what just happened question Youll never know Which is why you linger There might be one hidden clue here  somewhere  In this one you can see something the dad and the boy cant The mystery  how did an otherwise intact home get buried hundreds of feet down in the soil  is hidden from them They dont know the house is there Or maybe they do They seem to be looking for something And theres an empty space  a housesize space  framed by two desolated trees where the man and boy are standing I see a window frame sticking out of the ground Maybe they know what happened Maybe they know the Why and I know the Where so I want to lean down and tell them Dig Youll find it  feet below But when I lean in   they cant hear me They are locked into their time their space I am locked out Heres the same idea but flipped This house has been topsyturvied Its basement is now pointing to the sky but is totally intact Its roof is now under the ground pointed at  what exactly Is there a mirrorworld just below their feet Do they know What happened here The three befuddled family members dont have clue I imagine Neither do I The flip is surgical The plantings that once sat against the front porch are exactly where they used to be but the house has been cleanly yanked then returned in reverse position Who would do such a thing So much of what I do is to push my listeners to ask questions to think to wonder to muse Thomas Doyle has built storymaking sculptures that push you to ask and ask and ask His work makes questions flow even overflow even though we  there arent going to be any answers   What a wonderful mood to be in Im so jealous of what he does He does it so well If youd like to hang out with him for three minutes hes right here
