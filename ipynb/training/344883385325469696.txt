Most older adults choose not to use hearing aids Many find them too expensive difficult to manipulate embarrassing  or just   But hearing aids arent the only options available In selected situations a device known as a personal sound amplifying product or PSAP can be a useful alternative experts say  with some caveats The category includes a wide range of products sold in stores and over the Internet from  units that indiscriminately amplify sound to pocketsize devices with microphones and headphones that cost roughly  to  to sophisticated  earpiece units with some of the noisecanceling soundenhancing technology found in hearing aids Almost twothirds of people age  or older have some degree of hearing loss yet only  percent use hearing aids which can cost thousands of dollars and arent covered by Medicare But there are few products for older adults with incipient hearing loss who often deny any problems and put off seeking assistance for years   PSAPs can be entrylevel devices for people with mild hearing loss who know they need some help but are sitting on the fence said Barbara Weinstein head of the audiology program at the City University of New York Graduate Center Recognizing that the lines among hearing products have blurred the Food and Drug Administration said in a  statement that hearing aids are suitable for people with impaired hearing while   Think of hunters who need to be alert to every sound in the forest or someone at a large crowded lecture The agency oversees hearing aids but considers PSAPs consumer electronics products not subject to its regulatory review But recently organizations representing audiologists and hearing aid manufacturers have complained to the agency that some PSAP manufacturers are essentially marketing the devices as lowcost offtheshelf hearing aids without calling them such PSAP companies dispute the charge  In an email an FDA spokeswoman said the agency was reviewing the matter Unfortunately theres no reliable way to assess PSAPs and how well they work  I searched for a consumer guide to these products and couldnt find one Nor could any of the half dozen audiologists I spoke with point me toward a reference    Theres a lot of variability in these products and whats good for one person isnt necessarily good for another Dr Weinstein said You have to try them out  You might think audiologists would be helpful in this regard but generally theyre not  As a rule these hearing professionals have declined to recommend PSAPs citing the poor sound quality of cheaper units a lack of customization for individual hearing deficits and concern that people using the devices will forgo professional evaluation of their hearing difficulties Audiologists of course make money partly by selling higherpriced hearing aids But that may be changing as a new generation of technologically advanced PSAPs comes on the market   It used to be easy to say No dont buy one of these products its not going to help said Catherine Palmer director of audiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center But now there are some really good reliable PSAPs and every hearing aid manufacturer is going to be coming out with one     Here are some types of PSAPs on the market    Each is a movable unit about the size of a pack of cards with an attached microphone that transmits sound signals to someone wearing earphones or earbuds The nickname for this category comes from a product made by Williams Sound Devices of this type which sell for roughly  to  have been around for dozens of years Pocket talkers are very helpful on a shortterm basis for seniors who are having difficulty hearing in a oneonone situation said Kassie Witte coordinator of audiology at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx     The organization gives the devices to patients in its shortstay rehabilitation program who need help hearing doctors nurses dietitians and therapists  These are people who would benefit from a hearing aid but dont have one Ms Witte said Dr Weinstein said In my ideal world every nursing home and assisted living facility would have these devices available on the floor for visitors to use to communicate with residents  Theyre also a good choice for homebound older adults who cant manipulate hearing aids other experts said  Look on the Internet and youll see several PSAPs in the  to  range marketed as readers for your ears The experts I spoke with said this was a misleading claim  Hearing loss isnt like vision loss said Anne Oyler associate director for audiology professional practices at the American SpeechLanguageHearing Association   You cant put on a device and restore your hearing to    Once the quality of your hearing has been compromised no matter how loud you turn up the sound its not going to be clear Because hearing is complex and requires distinguishing speech from background noise you cant just put an amplifier in someones ear and expect a great result said Mark Ross principal investigator at the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Hearing Enhancement at Gallaudet University Consumers often complain about poor sound quality in online reviews of these devices and audiologists say they offer little help if any when theres background noise That said the devices may work adequately on occasion if an older adult is at home in a quiet room and wants some help communicating with another person    A wide variety of products with different features occupy the space between the low end of the PSAP market and the higher end Audiologists are most positive about sophisticated highercost products that rely on technology similar to that in hearing aids multiple channels for different noise environments noise cancellation features the ability to adjust audio signals directional microphones and more  The units sell for  or more   For people who dont want to spend several thousand dollars on hearing aids these products are a reasonable option  And if a PSAP gives you just enough help for a few years to hear better and communicate better thats a good outcome said Dr Palmer of Pittsburgh adding that the point is to make sure people stay in the conversation  Still the quality of these products varies significantly audiologists said  Buyer beware said Dr Oyler  Be sure that whatever product youre interested in has a warranty and customer support  Try to have a hearing evaluation first so an audiologist can tell you what kind of deficits you have and if youre a candidate for this kind of device
