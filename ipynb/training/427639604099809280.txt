 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. said Sunday that it is cutting short a 10-day trip after more than 300 of its passengers were stricken with a gastrointestinal illnessâ€”the latest vessel to see a small outbreak of disease. . The ship Explorer of the Seas is to return Wednesday, two days early, from its planned cruise from New Jersey to the Caribbean, said Janet Diaz, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean, as the number of sick passengers spiked over the weekend.
