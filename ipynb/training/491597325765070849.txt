A US appeals court on Tuesday dealt a significant blow to the Affordable Care Act when it threw out an IRS regulation that governs subsidies But before the ink dried on that decision another threejudge panel hearing a similar case issued a decision that was completely opposite In essence   by a threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down subsidies in the  states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice said the Obama administration will ask the case to be heard by the full judge panel We believe that this decision is incorrect inconsistent with Congressional intent different from previous rulings and at odds with the goal of the law to make health care affordable no matter where people live the spokeswoman Emily Pierce said in a statement The government will therefore immediately seek further review of the courts decision In the meantime to be clear people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has changed tax credits remain available  an industry digest this decision has the potential to affect nearly  million  or most  Americans who signed up for Obamacare through federal exchanges Losing the subsidies would mean that millions of US residents could become uninsured since health plans sold through the exchange might be unaffordable without the assistance Healthline reports Both courts here were looking at some language of the Affordable Care Act The courts were deciding whether Congress intended to provide subsidies for Americans who bought insurance through exchanges set up by states   the federal government on behalf of states In his concurring opinion Senior Circuit Judge Raymond Randolph wraps up the panels opinion succinctly One of the three judges dissented saying the majority failed to find ambiguity in the language where there clearly was The threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit   that the ambiguity in the statutes language means the subsidies can be given to both those who signed up using state exchanges and those who used federal exchanges Its possible that this dispute will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court  This post was updated to reflect the decision of the Fourth Circuit court
