The Food and Drug Administration is expected any day now to approve the first in a new class of drugs that can cure the leading cause of liver failure and liver cancer The disease is   a slowmoving but deadly virus that infects more than  million Americans The new treatment is a onceaday pill that can cure at least  percent of victims without the need for injections of   an immune stimulant that causes severe side effects The advent of interferonfree treatments for hepatitis C is an advance thats about as hot as Ive ever seen says   a liver specialist at Johns Hopkins University He says the new drugs are almost like curing lung cancer with only three months of onceaday pills Thats kind of an exaggeration because lung cancer treatment is worse than what we used to do to treat hepatitis C Thomas says But its that kind of thing  where we did something that didnt work that much and hurt people a lot And then we go from that to something thats  really an amazing transformation The first of the new hepatitis C drugs is Gilead Sciences   It interferes with the virus replication without much affecting cell metabolism The drug won a   from of an FDA advisory committee last October for interferonfree treatment of two strains of the virus in combination with the oral drug ribavirin Agency approval is expected by Dec  The advisory panel also recommended approval of sofosbuvir for treatment of the most common and difficulttotreat strain of hepatitis C called genotype But in that case it needs to be used with interferon But other new hepC drugs are   with approvals expected in late  or early  Some regimens may enable treatment of genotype without interferon too This is really a landmark shift in the treatment of hepatitis C says   of the Texas Liver Institute Its going to lead to a new generation of alloral pills for all patients without the use of interferon which is very tough for patients to take One of Lawitzs patients illustrates the potential Over the past eight years Henry Alameda a yearold carpenter who lives in San Antonio endured two grueling sixmonth treatment regimens that failed to clear the virus from his blood He thinks he was infected  years ago from the contaminated needle of an amateur tattoo artist The interferon side effects were hard to take Its like waking up with a bad cold he says You would have to get under the blanket and you would start shaking You would get real bad chills Interferon which is intended to get patients immune systems to attack the virus also commonly causes fatigue nausea diarrhea anemia and depression Two years ago Alameda got into a study of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin It was like a miracle pill he says It was just like taking an aspirin I had no side effects at all Some study patients have had headaches fatigue nausea itching and weakness but few have had to stop taking the pills because of side effects The new regimen worked for Alameda Fifteen months after he finished taking the pills theres no trace of the virus in his blood Doctors have pronounced him cured The safety effectiveness and low rate of side effects from the new regimens are expected to increase the number of hepatitis C patients who get treatment although many doctors may hold off until other drugs are approved and combinations are tested in different types of patients The potential impact is huge Hepatitis C infects    another insidious virus that takes years to cause lifethreatening disease The US Preventive Services Task Force   all Americans born between  and  should get tested for the infection  a population that includes  million baby boomers Thomas says the new treatments are coming at just the right time Many baby boomers got infected decades ago  by experimenting with drug use from blood transfusions or medical treatments that exposed them to contaminated blood from things like tattoos and piercings The virus can be transmitted sexually as well although the evidence is controversial Now an increasing number of infected people are beginning to show signs of liver damage Untreated the virus causes progressive liver scarring and eventually cirrhosis that can require liver transplants Its also the reason that liver cancer rates are increasing Alcohol use greatly accelerates the damage But the new drugs   The price of sofosbuvir hasnt been set but its expected to cost around  for a course of treatment Thats going to spark a lot of debate about who should be treated at what stage of infection But Johns Hopkins Thomas says society should consider the cost of forgoing treatment If we fail to provide treatment to an expanding population of persons at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer then well have even greater costs he says And they wont all be economic
