More than  people a year in the UK and Ireland report they have been conscious during surgery  despite being given general anaesthesia In the largest study of its kind scientists suggests this happens in one in every  operations They found episodes were more likely when women were given general anaesthesia for Caesarean sections or patients were given certain drugs Experts say though rare much more needs to be done to prevent such cases  Led by the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland researchers studied three million operations over a period of one year More than  people reported they had experienced some level of awareness during surgery  some recalled experiences from years ago Most episodes were shortlived and occurred before surgery started or after operations were completed But some  of cases resulted in longterm psychological harm  Patients described a variety of experiences  from panic and pain to choking  though not all episodes caused concern The most alarming were feelings of paralysis and being unable to communicate the researchers say One patient who wishes to remain anonymous described her experiences of routine orthodontic surgery at the age of   She said I could hear voices around me and I realised with horror that I had woken up in the middle of the operation but couldnt move a muscle  While they fiddled I frantically tried to decide whether I was about to die   She told researchers that for  years after her operation she had had nightmares of monsters leaping out to paralyse her  And it was only after she made the connection between this and her operation that the nightmares stopped   Each persons experience was analysed to identify factors that could make these situations more likely  About  occurred when musclerelaxant drugs  used to help paralyse muscles during surgery  were administered in combination with other drugs that normally dampen consciousness  Researchers believe in some of these cases patients received an inappropriate balance of medication leaving them paralysed but still aware  And there were several reports of awareness from women who had Caesarean sections while under general anaesthesia Though this type of anaesthesia is most often used in emergency situations researchers say women should be informed of the risks  They calculate up to one in  people who have Caesarean sections with general anaesthesia could experience some levels of awareness But experts argue this is partly due to the balance needed when achieving unconsciousness for the woman while still keeping the baby awake  Other common factors include lung and heart operations and surgery on patients who are obese And some  cases were due to drug errors Researchers are calling for a  checklist to be used at the start of operations and a nationwide approach to managing patients who have these experiences  Prof Tim Cook at the Royal United Hospital in Bath who led the research said For the vast majority it should be reassuring that patients report awareness so infrequently  However for a small number of patients this can be a highly distressing experience I hope this report will ensure anaesthetists pay even greater attention to preventing episodes of awareness
