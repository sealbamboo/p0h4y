Reaction was swift to the Obama administrations   that it was dropping a longrunning legal battle to keep age restrictions on one type of the morningafter birth control pill But like just about everything else in this decadelong controversy the latest decision has pleased just about no one To be clear the administration is not proposing that all forms of the drug be made available over the counter without age restrictions In fact in its   last night the Justice Department and the Food and Drug Administration are suggesting full ontheshelf availability for only a single product   The generic form of the   as well as older   of the product would remain available to teens under age  only by prescription At the White House briefing today spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama remains opposed to making the drug available to younger teens but he conceded that the administrations hand was forced legally We have been through a legal process and the court has ruled against the administration an appeals court Carney said That was a reference to a   denying the administrations request to delay an   that said the drug should be available without age restrictions at least while the appeal was heard And that ruling means that  meant that Plan B would be immediately available to anyone of any age said Carney Except that wasnt quite right For technical legal reasons it meant that only the older twopill formulation would become immediately available Instead the administration proposes keeping the twopill version agerestricted and making the brandname version of the onepill product Plan B OneStep available on the pharmacy shelf Carney said that is because at the very least that addresses some of the concerns about the ability of younger girls to use that medication Advocates for making all forms of the drug available dispute the administrations claims about younger teens ability to use the twopill formulations The products use the same hormone to   and thus pregnancy but the twopill version uses two doses taken  hours apart The government has been trying to argue for years that theres a distinction and the evidence in the record is that the twopill product is safe and effective and should be on the drugstore shelves said Nancy Northup president of the   which successfully argued the lawsuit that prompted the action But theres a more important reason why those who have been fighting for broader availability of the drug are unhappy with the administrations proposal Plan B OneStep is the only brandname product now available and thus the most expensive It retails for between  and  and this is not a minor issue said Susannah Baruch interim president and CEO of the   It has a real impact on giving all women meaningful access to emergency contraception We know generics tend to be  to  cheaper than the name brand and that can make all the difference for many women Other more conservative groups are also unhappy but for the opposite reason They dont want the product available to teenagers without a prescription at all We feel like they had a very good stance on the issue and that they were sticking by their guns which was to protect young girls and also parental rights says Anna Higgins who heads the   Center for Human Dignity So the fact that theyre throwing in the towel now just shows that they are caving to some political pressure Its not at all clear what happens next But one thing that is pretty clear says Baruch Dont expect to see the product at your neighborhood store instantaneously Thats because there are still a lot of things that have to happen First the judge in the case has to approve the governments proposal  which is not certain to happen If he does the FDA then has to approve new labeling for Plan B OneStep which it has promised to do without delay Only then will the drug be coming to a retail shelf near you
