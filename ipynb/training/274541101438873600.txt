Never mind that man or woman sitting in the dark deciphering the pictures that reveal the inner workings of your body Its common knowledge in medicine that many radiologists pick the lucrative specialty   because the hours are fairly predictable and the typical work doesnt require dealing with patients But radiology has an image problem with patients it seems Many of them dont know who the doctors are or what they do Only about half of patients surveyed when receiving a CT scan thought radiologists were physicians according to   at the Radiological Society of North Americas annual meeting in Chicago Why would it be any different Radiologists like pathologists work in the background giving information to other doctors who diagnose and treat patients Patients meet the techs who put them in MRI and CT scanners or lay them down on an Xray table And maybe at the end of it all patients get a disk with the pictures and a jargonfilled report of what the radiologists found There are exceptions of course Take   who very definitely get to know you as they snake catheters throughout your body And radiologists who specialize in breast imaging often work directly with patients Still the radiologists from Indiana University who conducted the survey of more than  patients scanned at an affiliated hospital say their findings suggest patients would like to know more The vast majority  about  percent  were interested or very interested in getting a copy of their radiology reports Nearly twothirds would like to be able to find out more about the radiologists from website bios What about laying eyes on them We didnt answer the question Do they want to meet us face to face  Dr Peter Miller a radiology resident who worked on the study tells Shots But they do want to know more about us Miller says he and his colleagues think ideally that radiologists do need to step out of the reading room It may be economically impractical for radiologists racing to interpret lots of images in a hurry to do much of that he concedes But Miller says we need to find practical solutions to address the desires of patients
