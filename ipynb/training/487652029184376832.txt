I recently had to leave a hospital where I was keeping a friend company after his cardiac procedure when visiting hours ended at  pm I wasnt worried because my friend was otherwise healthy mobile and alert He wasnt taking drugs that might have caused confusion or dizziness And he was only  which in my world is practically adolescent But what if hed been older frailer sicker Prone to falling if he tried to get out of bed unassisted At risk for   which we now know is not necessarily a transient reversible condition I would have been afraid to leave him alone until visiting hours resumed  hours later The hospital might have made an exception and let me stay it allows hour family visitors in several units including hospice oncology and pediatrics but it might not have Hence the campaign launched by the nonprofit Institute of Patient and FamilyCentered Care called Better Together to persuade hospitals to eliminate restrictive visiting hours and permit families broadly defined to remain with loved ones throughout their stays even in intensive care units You cant partner with families if youre locking them out of the hospital especially when patients are most vulnerable Beverley Johnson president of the institute told me in an interview Families have to be part of the team Hospital staffs have long resisted such efforts worried that extended visiting will stress patients interfere with care spread infection or exhaust families if theyre not sent home to rest As a result according to a survey of more than  hospitals in  and    though they often make exceptions Nearly  percent of ICUs have restrictive policies many Ms Johnson said still permit only minute visits once an hour or every two hours But even in ICUs theres scant evidence that visitors cause harm Restricting visiting in ICUs is neither caring compassionate nor necessary said   a decade ago It was coauthored by Donald Berwick before President Obama appointed him to head Medicare A dozen hospitals around the country have demonstrated that more welcoming policies for designated family members or care partners dont cause havoc The facilities include Contra Costa Regional Medical Center in California Anne Arundel Medical Center in Maryland Rochester General Hospital in upstate New York and the state university hospitals of Michigan Wisconsin and Washington See the full list on the   Families can play a crucial role Ms Johnson explained People should go to a hospital with a family member or trusted friend to be an advocate to ensure continuity to answer questions and prevent errors Because she was with her centenarian mother in a Florida hospital for example she could explain to a doctor who had never met either of them that that no her mother did not have a pacemaker and perhaps he had confused her with a different patient For older adults an accompanying friend or relative can serve a particularly crucial role helping to ward off delirium It afflicts  to  percent of hospitalized  to yearolds said Sharon Inouye a Harvard geriatrician and director of the Aging Brain Center at Hebrew SeniorLife In ICUs the rates climb even higher Familiar faces and voices can reduce confusion helping to reorient and calm patients The family can help provide relaxation and reassurance and comfort assist with feeding and hydration assist with communication Dr Inouye said though she cautioned that family members need   It could be tremendously beneficial The United States has about   according to the American Hospital Association The institute and its Better Together allies  including the American Association of CriticalCare Nurses and other professional and advocacy groups  want  of them to eliminate restrictive visiting policies by  That will requires administrative planning including staff training Its more than just taking down the signs for visiting hours Ms Johnson said It doesnt mean there are no boundaries she added Patients get to decide who stays and for how long and if family members get in the way if families are disruptive or make staff or other patients uncomfortable thats not OK If it escalates security needs to be involved But shes seen little of that A lot of hospitals were terrified by this she said Then they opened up and wondered what the fuss was all about
