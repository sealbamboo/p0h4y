After spending months working on a series of stories about the trillions of friendly microbes that live in and on our bodies I decided it might be interesting to explore my own microbiome So I pulled out my credit card and paid the  needed to sign up for the   one of a couple of citizen science or crowdsourced microbiome projects Organizers of the American Gut Project are recruiting thousands of people to donate their microbes to science  along with lots of personal information  to help researchers learn more about the trillions of microbes that inhabit the human body The fact that they may play a big role in your susceptibility to disease and health is profound I mean its astounding says   who helped dream up the American Gut Project It changes everything I think its a watershed moment for human health To give us a glimpse of that hidden universe and its impact on health we asked artist Ben Arthur to create an   of the human microbiome A few weeks later an envelope arrived in the mail with an instruction sheet and a long twopronged cotton swab After spending a week carefully logging the details of everything I ate and drank I used the swab to collect a fecal sample and mailed it off for analysis While I was waiting for the results I spent some time talking to bioethicists about some concerns I had heard about participating in these projects I think sending pieces of your microbiome in to be analyzed and posted along with your health information is not for the faint of heart   a bioethicist at Stanford University For one thing volunteers could end up finding out really scarysounding things they never expected he said I dont know how likely it is but we could say by looking at Rob Steins microbiome that Rob is going to die of cancer in the next three years said Greely That could upset Rob Stein and his friends and his admirers of whom there are many no doubt Beyond that Greely said such projects also raise questions about privacy If you have privacy concerns at all you shouldnt do it Greely said Heres why Volunteers in these projects disclose lots of very personal stuff about their health their daily habits and their families Its all supposed to be kept strictly confidential but theres no way to guarantee that these days Greely said Revealing any kind of personal health information could cause a variety of problems including difficulties getting jobs longterm care insurance or life insurance Those are legitimate concerns Greely said In addition while the project is aimed at analyzing the genes of microbes volunteers DNA might end up in the sample and inadvertently become public he said The fact that people are being encouraged to donate samples from everyone in their family including children worries   a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin Madison When its a child first of all more will be learned as we go through that childs life about the implications of microbiome information she says And there is a longer time during which that information may come back to bite the person And theres another angle thats really tricky according to   a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill What if someone ends up profiting from research involving an individuals microbes Should they get a cut It may turn out that I actually have a potentially lucrative biome if I have the right bacteria Maybe I should have some control over any profits that could be made from them Juengst says Profits from for example a popular probiotic or yogurt made with the helpful bacteria So all of this was in the back of my mind months later when I reconnected with Leach to hear what they had found about my microbes Leach asked me to open an attachment in an email A series of multicolored bar charts popped up on the screen Some showed my microbes while others displayed those of other volunteers including Leach for comparison It turned out my microbes are very different than Leachs His are dominated by a totally different kind of bacteria than mine And then something even more interesting jumped out at Leach At the very top in that little pink thing at the top of your bar youll see that a little over  percent of all the bacteria in your sample belong to the phylum   he said Proteobacteria includes a lot of your bad guys Leach said such as E coli and salmonella They are associated with inflammation that may increase the risk of heart disease cancer and other health problems Leach has no proteobacteria And at the bottom of my bar Leach saw something else I have very low levels of another species called   Those are typically considered good bacteria Leach said So the more actinobacteria you have the better Theyre helpful Leach said Theyre antiinflammatory Theyre known to suppress proteobacteria So those are often known as probiotics Actinobacteria are often added to yogurt for example Leach has much more actinobacteria than I do So Leach started asking me about my diet He eats the Paleo diet which is heavy on stuff like meat and vegetables People who eat a lot of onion garlic and leeks tend to have higher levels of beneficial actinobacteria he said So I would suggest that you probably dont eat a lot of garlic onions and leek at least not as much as I do So would that be accurate Leach asked I love garlic and onions and I do eat leeks occasionally But Leach was right I dont eat those foods nearly as often as Leach does He eats them daily So by looking at my microbes Leach was able to learn quite a bit about my diet including the fact that I dont eat a lot of whole grains and make some guesses about my possible health risks But Leach is the first to admit that this is all pretty speculative right now No one can really say much of anything about anyone for sure just by looking at their microbes Is this going to diagnose your disease Absolutely not Is this going to change your life You know maybe maybe not We dont suggest that this is something you can print out and run down to your doctors office with Leach said Thats not what the projects about What the projects about Leach stressed is helping scientists learn more about our microbes  not only what they may be doing to us but also what we may be doing to them such as disturbing them by taking too many antibiotics I asked Leach about all those ethical concerns First of all he said the project is all about advancing science not making money And as far as the privacy concerns go Leach said the project is taking pains to keep everything private In place are the most stringent privacy protocols that you could possibly imagine Its all under lock and key if you will he said But Leach acknowledged that there are never any guarantees Theres always a chance somebody might be able to figure out your sample your results or whatever So if those concerns are there then we tell people you know not to join the study because its not  percent foolproof  nothing is he said So there you have it I should think about eating more garlic leeks onions and maybe whole grains And if Im worried about all this getting out in public I probably shouldnt have decided to put it on the radio in the first place
