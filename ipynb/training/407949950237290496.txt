Seitzs diagnoses came after she sought a second look She heeded the recommendation to follow up for a spot on her thyroid even though she was told it was probably nothing and then she was insistent after being given an allclear following a mammogram  In both cases Seitz  of Atlanta followed her instincts and she was right One patient advocate applauds that She moved the bar in her own favor by being proactive and trusting her intuition said Trisha Torrey who was not involved in Seitzs case I have a highdemand job said Seitz director of Workplace  Global Business Services for CocaCola This is like a second job and no one else is going to do the research Her thyroid spot was seen during an annual physical Even though doctors told her it probably wasnt cause for concern Seitz followed up with an endocrinologist four months later and underwent a biopsy A week later she got a call saying that it was probably cancer and that doctors would know for sure after surgery to remove it  Her philosophy tackle cancer and move on she says  She had a thyroidectomy It was the easiest surgery ever The next day I was on a plane going somewhere for work with a bandage and wearing scarves she said  Eight weeks later she had radiation iodine treatment She took a radioactive pill and stayed isolated in her house for a week and then limited outings for another week Two weeks before she took the pill she felt something unusual during a breast selfexam and asked about it during her scheduled mammogram a week or so later  She got an allclear but didnt trust it and went in for an ultrasound The radiologist sent her for a biopsy which confirmed that she had breast cancer  Once again she geared up to tackle the disease Its another specialty and you start over from scratch she said  After her lumpectomy Seitz had  days of radiation Now she takes medication for both cancers  Seitz offeres this advice about taking charge of your care  When looking for a surgeon to remove her thyroid Seitz asked everyone from her dentist and orthodontist to her gynecologist  It doesnt matter what their specialty is They all know each other and Ive learned you have to ask multiple doctors she said  Instead of asking them Who should I go to Seitz asked If you were in this situation who would you go to She got a list of about nine names when looking for a surgeon for her thyroid and chose the doctor whose name was recommended four times She followed this same procedure before her breast biopsy Brawley recommends casting a wider net including anyone in the health care field  The nurses who work in the ORs at hospitals they know who the best surgeons are These are not necessarily those who rank in the lists of best doctors he said   The first time Seitz visited her oncologist she explained that she and her husband were leaving on an African safari their trip of a lifetime the first week in August  Seitz wanted to mark her th birthday by going somewhere new She told her oncologist she had to be better by then Her last radiation treatment was  days before her flight to Africa which gave her time to recover before takeoff  Doctors may not have a deadline she says If I have something else happening I am going to find a reason to give them a deadline because things happen much quicker  Even if they must pay for it out of their own pocket Seitz recommends that women undergo a mammogram every other year along with an ultrasound  If you feel something or there is any uncertainty about the scan she says insist on an MRI instead of a second mammogram Things would have turned out differently she says if she had accepted her clear mammogram report and not insisted on an ultrasound  The American Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for women starting at age   Brawley agrees that mammograms are not foolproof but cautions that ultrasound and MRI screenings are meant to get a better look at something not to replace a mammogram   Seitz decided right away that she would not let her diagnosis dominate her life She focused on the things she enjoys in life and maintained her daily routine  I thought if I stop and change my routine I give this thing more power she said Theres no doubt that having a positive attitude helps in terms of quality of life Brawley says The jury is still out on whether it prolongs life   If ever you are diagnosed with something never read the Internet Julie concluded after spending an afternoon reading some websites about thyroid cancer before her surgery  It was negative it was horrible it was pitiful I said No I am not going to be like these people It was pretty depressing and I just decided no this is not who I am I never conquered anything in my life this way and its not going to be this either  Though Brawley says its an individual decision he says people should be careful about where they seek information online and ensure that its a reputable source such as the National Cancer Institute  Seitz believes that a sea change is needed on how cancer is viewed People should think of it as You are going to get cancer so how can you stay on top of tests and getting checked and getting monitored so you are diagnosed earlier Most cancers are curable at stage  or   Torrey says this preventive approach applies not just to cancer to but to all illnesses and conditions Youre going to catch something and you have to be prepared she said Meanwhile Seitz says dont put off fun Dont wait to retire to do all the fun things you want to do
