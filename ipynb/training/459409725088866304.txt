At times when I consider my losses I feel like a loser in the battle against selfpity Like many diseases cancer has everything to do with loss of a breast or a leg of a chunk of liver or lung of continence of mental capacity of life itself   My losses like those of most people vary in scope The biggest is the loss of physical autonomy I must rely on all sorts of equipment and medicine to keep me going Then there is the big loss of my teaching job Enforced retirement isolates me from the intellectual community that had sustained me throughout my life The smaller losses of my hair and of not being able to feel my feet sometimes loom larger than they should    But why be a downer Who wants to wallow To take my mind off my woes it is always possible to think of someone worse off As I child I was told how lucky I was compared with the starving children in China Now I mourn violence against women in Congo Yet it feels meanspirited to buck oneself up with the misery of others not an attractive option    Neither can I bear to become a Pollyanna counting the manifold blessings of loving family and friends of reading near a window overlooking a beech tree of a cardinal at the bird feeder I realize that I should subscribe to the idea of abundant recompense of looking on the bright side of the glass half full of the silver lining but it can elude me What I need then is something more stringent or even mordant  During those moments I return to Elizabeth Bishops poem One Art The key words that Bishop repeats are master and disaster In this villanelle Bishop had the chutzpah to teach her readers how to master disaster   Practice makes perfect she ruefully assures us and then explains how Start by losing small things like keys or a badly spent hour and then up the ante with larger stakes Practice losing farther losing faster for example the places you meant to visit a mothers watch a treasured house In the process of losing the poet implies your skin will thicken you will get stronger more resilient   The art of losing isnt hard to master Bishop insists pointing out that she has suffered the loss of cities rivers even a continent She misses them all but it wasnt a disaster I have had enough experience of losing that I can imagine losses that I have not yet incurred the loss of my house in a fire my parents loss of their native land through a forced emigration With a tight grip on the demanding form of the verse Bishop grits her teeth steeling herself assuring herself and me that these dreadful travails can be survived The boastful final stanza always catches me up After diagnosis I read the lost you of One Art as me Surely my husband and daughters and stepdaughters will master the disaster of my demise the absence of my voice and gestures I need to believe they can and will But of course I know that Bishop was writing about the abandonment or death of a beloved companion   And then I am flooded with terror that I could not master the disaster of losing my husband one of our girls their partners or children My list widens to include my brother cousins godchildren close friends I would rather be lost than lose not that we are given a choice Bishops parenthetical phrases and the repetition of the word like in the final line tell me that she also loses her breath chokes or stutters at the thought of inconsolable bereavement Losing a member of my family would be the worst a soulshattering tragedy In comparison my current losses from cancer amount to nothing at all  nada bupkis Under the shadow of that possible but thankfully unrealized nightmare I remember a student who memorized One Art and stood to recite it at the front of a lecture hall of  freshmen because he explained privately it helped him come to terms with the death of his father His voice trembled   Dealing with a disaster that had happened he relied on Bishops One Art to give his loss a rhyme and rhythm to find sound sense in nonsensical grief even if only provisionally In the face of what cannot be righted Bishop understood the clenched urgency of heeding the imperative Write it just as my student grasped the need to recite it     Now a glance out the window at a cardinal perched in the beech tree confirms my need to lavish love on those who could so easily be lost
