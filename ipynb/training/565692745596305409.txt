A row has erupted about links between the sugar industry and scientists who advise government on obesity  Campaigners argue the scientists are so heavily influenced by companies that Dracula is now in charge of the blood bank The scientists concerned say it is wrong to assume they are biased and critics should learn proper science Public Health England said it welcomed industry listening to our best scientists The argument was sparked by a   It claims Prof Susan Jebb  the governments obesity tsar a University of Oxford academic and an expert in a recent threepart BBC documentary series on obesity  has attracted more than m of industry funding This includes money from CocaCola Unilever and Cereal Partners  The article says members of a government advisory panel  the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition SACN  are supported by companies such as PepsiCo Mars and Nestle It also claims that of the  scientists affiliated with SACN between  and  just  had no connections to the sugar industry BMJ editorinchief Fiona Godlee said the investigation showed there was a network of relationships between key public health experts and the sugar industry She said these sorts of links create bias and weaken public health efforts to tackle the harmful effects of sugar on the diet Prof Simon Capewell from the University of Liverpool and an adviser for the group Action on Sugar told the BBC I was shocked quite honestly this is heartbreaking news and basically it appears a lot of people have been seriously misled He said there would be an inherent conflict of interest between profits and public health Its like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank he concluded  But that is an insult fundamentally wrong and shows a need to learn some proper science according to Prof Ian MacDonald who led a review of sugar guidelines last year  The draft report by SACN said sugar added to food or naturally present in fruit juice and honey    half the current recommendation He said the committee was clearly not biased as that draft report is tougher on sugar than the World Health Organization report is or any other report is He told the BBC News website he was not embarrassed at advising industry but acknowledged the general public was very sceptical Were worldrespected scientists whose opinions are provided to government and to industry and those people use that information as they see fit he said Prof Jebb defended her record telling the BBC As a scientist my independence and personal credibility are crucial to me Moreover everything I do is aimed at improving public health She said there were times when it makes good sense to work with industry She cited one project funded by CocaCola that proved its product was    If a company has genuine reason to believe their product or ingredient or programme works then it seems appropriate to me that they should fund a trial to prove it ideally conducted by independent scientists she added A spokesperson for SACN in a statement issued through Public Health England said We welcome that industry is listening to our best scientists who can tell them what harm sugar is doing to the nations health Prof Jebb used to run the Medical Research Councils Human Nutrition Research unit Dr Frances Rawle the head of policy at the Medical Research Council said We ensure that all research we fund is free of any influence from those with whom we collaborate be they a charity or a commercial organisation  We actively encourage researchers to work with industry and where its appropriate we jointly fund many projects with industry partners or provide independent scientific expertise  Nutrition research is a good example because working with food and diet industry can help to directly translate high quality research into public health benefit
