Bosses at an NHS trust failed hundreds of breast cancer patients an independent report has found    by lawyer Sir Ian Kennedy found concerns about surgeon Ian Paterson dated back to  but were not dealt with for four years   He carried out cleavage sparing mastectomies while at the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust and the review found some women were exposed to a risk of cancer returning The trust said it was very sorry Solihull Hospital previously found the surgeon breached guidelines over a procedure that involved leaving behind breast tissue to provide an improved cleavage Sir Ians report made a number of recommendations relating to better transparency improved recording of information the role of regulators encouraging staff to raise concerns and increased scrutiny It found senior managers at the trust did not respond effectively until  and said their response was neither sufficiently robust nor rigorous Following Mr Patersons suspension by the General Medical Council GMC last year it referred the case to officers at West Midlands Police A spokeswoman for the force confirmed its investigations are continuing Sir Ians report said the case had lessons for the whole NHS It is a story of clinicians at their wits end trying for years to get the trust to address what was going on It is a story of clinicians going along with what they knew to be poor performance  It is a story of weak and indecisive leadership from senior managers It is a story of secrecy and containment Mr Paterson was appointed by the trust as a surgeon in  Sir Ian said the breast surgeon who has since been placed under an interim suspension order was allowed to carry on operating on women for several years despite a series of concerns raised about him by other medical staff He added I was shocked by how long it took for effective action to be taken Why was there not in place a system that could properly address the needs of women Sir Ian said senior managers resorted to a sort of auto pilot and excluded everyone but a small number in the know However the report went on to say that it was mistaken and naive to believe that any one person was truly responsible The report said the trust had a huge task on its hands to win back some measure of confidence It added Staff have lost confidence in the management of the trust theyfeel betrayed that no one listened to them that things were allowed to go unchallenged for so long that they cannot trust those charged with leading the trust The review found the trust board was excluded from access to much of the information by senior managers and made no formal effort to assert itself and become involved Sir Ian said The board is responsible for everything that happens in the trust and if they are going to sleep on the job and dont hold their chief executive to account then they have failed Up to  women are believed to be suing the trust for failing to take action over the claims NHS England said it fully supports the recommendations that Sir Ian details in his report Trust chairman Lord Philip Hunt said I wish to give a full unreserved apology to all patients and their relatives This was completely unacceptable and I am very sorry indeed He said a taskforce would be set up in January to oversee the implementation of Sir Ians recommendations Lynne Rolinson  from Solihull underwent a mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery performed by Mr Paterson in January  She said I feel its quite a tragedy Had the trust listened to people who raised concerns in  and  I would not be standing here Its very difficult to deal with on a daytoday basis because I dont really know if Im clear or Im not Kashmir Uppal from Thompsons Solicitors which is handling almost  of the compensation cases said she welcomed the conclusions of the report She said she was concerned about the failings of the trust and the failings of senior management to act against Mr Paterson The fact that clinicians tried to raise their concerns and werent listened to its just not acceptable
