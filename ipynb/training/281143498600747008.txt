Parents drill certain warnings into their children dont drink dont smoke and dont do drugs But those conversations have gotten tougher now that two states Colorado and Washington have   some recreational marijuana use Trying to explain this to my yearold is hard said Tami deBellis of Olympia Wash Shes a mother who shared her thoughts with NPRs   on Facebook I explained the benefits for some critically ill patients and adults if used legally It was probably way above his grade level But whether your child is  or  conversations about drugs are even more important to have now says   a pediatrician and chief of adolescent Medicine at Seattle Childrens Hospital She says marijuana is the No  drug that sends teenagers to her substance abuse clinic Dr Walker that the drug potentially poses more risks to kids and teens because their brains are still developing That could also leave them more vulnerable to addiction You put something like marijuana into the mix of a developing brain and for some kids its going to be the first time theyve had a drug thats going to cause lifelong addiction for them says Dr Walker The smoke alone can have be harmful to young children If you wouldnt smoke cigarettes at home in front of your kids because you know of the dangers you shouldnt think marijuanas going to be better she says If parents use marijuana themselves they should be careful about the example theyre setting for their children Dr Walker says that using marijuana  even legally  in front of children can send a dangerous signal that drugs are the answer to stress Moms at home smoking some marijuana it helps mellow her out Kids learn those messages and those are very powerful messages As more states discuss the pros and cons of legalizing marijuana Dr Walker hopes that young people dont get a distorted image about drug use It may seem like it but the vast majority of kids are not using marijuana at this time Itll be a natural experiment to see what happens over the next few years she says
