Sawyers wife Decontee Sawyer lives in Coon Rapids Minnesota with the couples three young daughters yearold Eva yearold Mia and Bella who is  The Sawyers are naturalized citizens their daughters were born in the United States  He was so proud when he became a US citizen Decontee told CNN He voted for first time in the last US presidential election He lived in the US for many years and wanted that for Liberia  a better democracy  Sawyer had been caring for his Ebolastricken sister in Liberia Decontee said though at the time he didnt know she had Ebola Sawyer is the first American to die in what health officials are calling the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history His death has   that the virus could potentially spread to the United States People werent really taking it Ebola seriously until it hit Patrick Decontee said People are ready to take action Lets take a step back and look at what we know about the Ebola outbreak Up until this past week the Ebola outbreak had been contained to three West African countries Guinea where it began Liberia and Sierra Leone Sawyer is the first known case outside of these three countries   the World Health Organization had confirmed more than  Ebola cases in the region but suspects there have been many unreported infections and there may be more like  cases Sierra Leone has been hardest hit with approximately  cases  The World Health Organization says as of July  there have been  confirmed Ebola deaths and another  suspected deaths bringing the number possibly to more than   The country of Guinea has the most suspected deaths The epidemic has been in that country longer It is believed the epidemic began in the nations capital of Conakry While international leaders have mobilized to fight the epidemic it can be a difficult one to stop It is so highly infectious that it typically kills  of those who catch it The death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly  since it has been treated early in many instances There is however no Ebola vaccination Last week two American aid workers in Liberias capital city Monrovia were confirmed to have the disease Doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected It can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected persons bodily fluids Dr Kent Brantly a yearold Fort Worth Texas resident had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia when he started to feel sick Brantly works with Samaritans Purse a Christian international relief agency He has been the medical director for the Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia and has been working to help Ebola patients since October After testing positive for Ebola Brantly went into treatment at ELWA Hospital Samaritans Purse has been working to evacuate him for better care said Ken Isaacs vice president of the agency Unfortunately emergency medical evacuation flights in the area are not equipped to handle the intense isolation required for an Ebola patient Brantlys family had been with him in Liberia according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but left for the United States before he became symptomatic as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him Out of an abundance of caution they are on a day fever watch the CDC said We have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support the Brantly family said in a statement Kent remains very physically weak but his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal Nancy Writebol from Charlotte North Carolina has also been infected She is employed by Serving in Mission or SIM and had teamed up with the staff from Samaritans Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Monrovia when she got sick She too is undergoing treatment It is believed one of the local staff was infected with Ebola and came to work with the virus on Monday and Tuesday Isaacs told CNN  We think it was in the scrubdown area where the disease was passed to both Nancy and Kent he said That staff member died on Thursday Both Brantly and Writebol are stable according to a statement released Tuesday by SIM though both patients are still exhibiting symptoms of the virus Due to the upsurge in cases of Ebola in the region SIM and Samaritans Purse have taken the precautionary step of mandating the evacuation of all nonessential personnel from Liberia the statement said Timing means and place of evacuation are being decided now The CDC held a media briefing Monday to emphasize that there is no significant risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States  There has never been a confirmed case of Ebola spreading to a developed country said Kamiliny Kalahne an epidemiologist with Doctors Without Borders This is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick have a high fever and a lot of symptoms  and in these situations they dont travel And even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country they will be in a good hospital with good infection control so they are very unlikely to infect others she said The US health care system is also better suited to handle an Ebola case than many in West Africa said Dr Marty Cetron director of CDCs Division of Global Migration and Quarantine Health officials would likely recognize such a case and be able to trace all points of contact with the patient to prevent further transmission he said  Epidemics of disease are often followed by epidemics of fear and epidemics of stigma Cetron said All of these things occur in a social context that can make containment very challenging That said Sawyer did end up on an airplane at an international airport Whats to say others might not do the same and actually make it to the United States Count CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta among those who believe its going to happen at some point  One big reason is that it takes  to  days between the time a person is infected and when he or she shows symptoms  including vomiting diarrhea impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding  Ebola is not contagious until symptoms appear though that doesnt mean a person cannot travel in the incubation period Just observing the whole process its almost impossible to prevent from happening Gupta said But I think  it can be then stemmed so it doesnt turn into all these minisecondary outbreaks Avoiding these West African countries is the easiest way to prevent the outbreak from spreading Cetron said If you have traveled recently to the region and develop a fever or other symptoms consistent with Ebola notify your doctor right away   If youre a humanitarian worker in the region you need to be familiar with proper infection control precautions and avoid contact with blood or any other bodily fluids he said You should also report any needle sticks or possible exposures early to receive testing and if necessary start treatment as soon as possible  The Sawyer family is working with their church community to start   Decontee said Their goal is to raise  to help two international organizations Samaritans Purse and Global Health Ministry While experimental vaccines exist there are no licensed ones that get widespread use according to the World Health Organization  The disease can be devastating and ultimately deadly in a few ways One is because it disarms your immune system so it cannot fight the virus Gupta notes Another is that it causes people to lose fluids because of vomiting and diarrhea in addition to bleeding as Ebola inhibits ones ability to clot adds Gupta The most important thing a person needs to do to survive is to get treated as early and effectively as possible But thats not always easy in some parts of Africa says Monia Sayah a nurse with the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders We go into communities where we are not necessarily welcome because they understand now that the survival rate is not very high Sayah told CNNs Anderson Cooper  Sayah acknowledges that in addition to immediate family members health care workers are among those at highest risk of being infected One need look no farther than Dr Sheik Humarr Khan a doctor who was on the front lines fighting the   outbreak in Sierra Leone before dying this week from complications of the disease Health care workers don gowns gloves and masks among other measures to guard against the disease Every inch of the body has to be covered Sayah said Its essential
