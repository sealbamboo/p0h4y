The most heated part of the fight between the Obama administration and religious groups over new rules that require most health plans to   actually has nothing to do with birth control It has to do with abortion Specifically do emergency contraceptives interfere with a fertilized egg and cause what   The Health and Human Services preventive services mandate forces businesses to provide the morningafter and the weekafter pills in our health insurance plans said David Green founder and CEO of the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby one of the firms   These abortioncausing drugs go against our faiths The morningafter pill hes referring to is sold under the brand name   The weekafter pill which actually only works for five days after unprotected sex is called   Both are classified by the Food and Drug Administration as contraceptives Neither is the same as the abortion drug RU or   That pill isnt considered a contraceptive and isnt covered by the new insurance requirements The constant references to Plan B and ella as abortioncausing pills frustrates   a professor of health policy at George Washington University and a former assistant commissioner for womens health at the FDA It is not only factually incorrect it is downright misleading These products are not abortifacients she says And their only connection to abortion is that they can prevent the need for one Thats not a universal medical opinion however It would be my preference that none of these products had any potential to cause abortion or postfertilization effects  that would be my preference  but we dont know that says Gene Rudd senior vice president of the   and a practicing OBGYN in Bristol Tenn Thats not really the case anymore For years scientists knew the pills particularly Plan B were highly effective in preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex but werent exactly sure how they managed that It wasnt really clear whether it worked before ovulation or after ovulation says Wood Scientists did know the drug worked primarily by preventing ovulation It stops an egg from being released from a womans ovary and thus prevents any chance of fertilization and pregnancy But they also thought the drug might make it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant in a womans uterus Technically thats not an abortion says Wood We know that about half of fertilized eggs never stick around They just pass out of the womans body she says An abortifacient is something that interrupts an established pregnancy But people like Rudd worry that even if what the drugs do is not technically abortion its still objectionable if it happens after fertilization But it turns out at least when it comes to Plan B there is   that shows the only way it works is by preventing ovulation and therefore fertilization Weve learned a lot about how these drugs work says Diana Blithe a biochemist and contraceptive researcher at the   I think its time to revise our speculations about how things might work in view of data that show how things do work For example says Blithe a   published just last year led the   to declare that Plan B does not inhibit implantation And some abortion opponents in the medical community are beginning to accept that conclusion Up until recently I would not prescribe the Plan B product because we didnt have enough science to say it doesnt have a postfertilization effect says Rudd Now Im becoming  sitting on the fence with that Less however is known about ella the other widely available emergency contraceptive And thats where the controversy continues to rage It kills embryos And it kills embryos before they implant and it kills embryos after they implant says Donna Harrison director of research and public policy for the   Harrison says the biggest problem with ella is that its a chemical cousin of the abortion pill RU So at an equal dose of ella and RU they cause equal actions she says But NIHs Blithe who worked to bring ella to market says thats wrong First of all she says a woman would never take ella and RU in similar doses unless they were trying to harm themselves But more importantly while the drugs may be related ella works much differently Its chemically similar to RU but it was designed to have stronger effects on the ovary and less effect on the endometrium she says RU works in part by changing the lining of the uterus  the endometrium  to make it impossible for an early pregnancy to be sustained Blithe says studies have also shown that ella like Plan B doesnt prevent pregnancy if a woman has already ovulated Women who took the drug after ovulation got pregnant at the same rate as those who took nothing at all She says that strongly suggests it does not have any effect on blocking implantation Ella opponents arent convinced To be as successful as they say it is it would have to have postfertilization effects says Rudd But opposition seems to be waning in Europe Ella is now available in heavily Roman Catholic   for example And on Thursday   said both drugs are acceptable to give to rape victims in Catholic hospitals
