New research claiming that a double cheeseburger might be as   may have caused protein lovers to choke on their milkshakes Relax Despite the ominoussounding conclusion from a University of Southern California press release that too much dietary protein raises the risk of dying of cancer in middle age theres actually very little valid information to back up the findings Some of the new research is consistent with the current thinking that diets high in animal fats can increase chronic disease risk and that longterm consumption of a plantbased diet can reduce the risk of chronic illness and death The other conclusions are only theories not fact By combining epidemiologic data in humans preliminary mice studies and laboratory cell studies the researchers have connected the dots in a series of explanations which do not hang together as an evidencebased concept The report which was published earlier this week in Cell Metabolism attempts to find a causeandeffect relationship of dietary protein and cancer risk but fails  The headline of the press release from the University of California is running ahead of the evidence and the comparison with smoking is really unwarranted in terms of the relative risks and the certainty of the adverse effects of smoking says Tom Sanders head of the Nutritional Sciences Research Division Kings College London  Examining the  reveals further limitations with the studys conclusions The number of people selected from this very large database was relatively small  an estimated  While the dietary protein intake was selfreported there was no distinction between animal proteins that are healthy fish or skinless chicken or those containing high amounts of saturated fats fatty red meats This is a major concern and limits the conclusions of the results  Sending out statements such as this can damage the effectiveness of important public health messages says nutrition scientist Gunter Kuhnle of the University of Reading They can help to prevent sound health advice from getting through to the general public Rather than be alarmed over protein the takeaway should be a diet containing high quality proteins rich in fruits and vegetables with a focus on plantbased eating is recommended and supported by science
