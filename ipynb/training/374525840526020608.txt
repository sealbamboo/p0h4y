Music has played a good part of his longevity said his wife Mary Iacono  Were blessed that were both in good health As scientists race to figure out how to promote healthy aging of the brain and prevent dementia their preliminary advice for senior citizens has become a chorus of voices Stay active Have hobbies Be socially engaged  Playing music for some people is a natural answer to all of those recommendations Frank Iacono for instance has been playing violin since he was   just because he loves it  But does music playing in particular stave off dementia What about just listening to music How many years do you need to engage in music before it benefits your brain   Researchers are exploring these questions in the face of staggering statistics about the aging population The number of Americans  and older with Alzheimers is   by    million from  million now The annual cost of dementia in the United States in  will be  trillion according to the Alzheimers Association Early research suggests keeping the brain active  such as by    may hold back dementia symptoms by up to five years Scientists are hoping to find that the same is true for music playing said   assistant professor of neurology at Emory University who studies cognitive functioning among musicians  If you can delay the presentation of dementia by five years then you add an extra five years of functioning to an individual at the end of the life span she said In terms of fiscal cost and everything thats actually quite a lot A  using Swedens twin registry is looking at intellectually and physically stimulating lifestyle factors that could help stave off cognitive decline One component of this effort is exploring whether playing music protects against dementia The results discussed at the Interdisciplinary Society for Quantitative Research in Music and Medicine meeting in July are not yet published   Twin studies carry special importance in science Usually when people participate in a study they each carry a different set of genetics and may have had different upbringings Those factors could influence whatever researchers want to investigate Fraternal twins however share about  of genes and identical twins share almost all Twins also likely grew up in the same environment To me the most intriguing aspect is in a twin pair if one becomes demented and the other doesnt what did one not do Or what did the one who did become demented do that might give you some clues about ways that other people can mitigate their risk asked Margaret Gatz director of the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins and professor at the University of Southern California  Researchers examining the broader twin data have found that for women specifically participating in intellectual and cultural activities was linked to lower dementia risk in   Activities such as   at midlife for both sexes are also protective against dementia the study suggests All of these kind of add up in suggesting that a more engaged lifestyle is a good thing for the aging brain Gatz said Why would an engaged lifestyle help prevent dementia The idea is that brain stimulation may counteract brain changes that occur because of cognitive decline so that a person can function for longer Gatz said  Music playing in particular is something that people can continue to enjoy for longer than their occupations or strenuous physical activity Gatz said It also has cognitive physical and potentially socially components so it engages many brain networks  Unfortunately the twin study has so far only looked at associations between lifestyle factors and dementia it doesnt prove that music can protect you against cognitive decline The study also doesnt include brain imaging or autopsies so the precise mechanism  how engagement in activities would prevent dementia  is unknown  There is other emerging evidence that playing music could help prevent dementia  HannaPladdy the Emory neuropsychologist is interested in exploring the biological underpinnings further Her theory agrees with Gatzs Brain networks that have been strengthened by musical engagement compensate to delay the detrimental effects of aging a process called cognitive reserve  So far her research has demonstrated that extensive musical instrumental training even in amateur musicians provides a cognitive benefit that can last throughout a persons life Her studies were published in  in the journal   and in  in the journal   they included instrumentalists not singers  HannaPladdy and her colleagues found in their first study that even if participants did not continue playing music as they aged they still performed better at tasks of objectnaming visuospatial memory and rapid mental processing and flexibility than those who didnt play at all  as long as they had played for at least  years Thats critical because as they age people may lose motor skills or eyesight that prevents them from playing their instruments  The study also suggests the cognitive benefits of instrumental training can last a lifetime  One of the studys participants said in an interview that he felt like having played for so long was akin to an insurance policy HannaPlady said  The researchers more recent study showed that musicians who began playing before age  had better verbal working memory functions than those who started later or didnt play at all This finding is consistent with verbal language acquisition  linguistics studies have shown that there is a critical period during which the brain is open to learning a language and fluency becomes far more difficult after a certain age in childhood  It also jives with the findings of   that showed professional musicians who began training before age  had a thicker anterior corpus callosum part of the pathway that links the right and left hemispheres of the brain  And participants who continued to play their instruments at older ages tended to perform better on tasks of visuospatial judgment suggesting that there continues to be plasticity in advanced age HannaPladdy said   Finding a way to harness this plasticity is probably one of the biggest hopes we have for treating brain disorders or dealing with cognitive decline in advanced age she said Similarly continuing to play music in advanced age added a protective benefit to individuals with less education which has previously been demonstrated to be one of the most robust ways to create cognitive reserve Thus musical training appears to be a viable model for cognitive stimulation and can be conceptualized as an alternate form of education Is it worth it then to teach an older person to play an instrument perhaps one who already shows signs of cognitive decline Recent research suggests its harder but still possible to modify the brain in an older person But no one has a definitive answer on whether teaching an elderly person a new instrument would lead to the same kinds of benefits that scientists have found in lifelong musicians It would be pretty challenging considering theyre having a hard time remembering HannaPladdy said of dementia patients It may be beneficial to provide musical stimulation to individuals in the earlier phases referred to as mild cognitive impairment or to reinitiate musical practice in individuals who are no longer engaged Regardless since people find music enjoyable trying to learn an instrument wont hurt But more research is needed over a long period of time to assess fully the benefits of music among elderly people HannaPladdy said  Evidence may continue to emerge that longterm music playing has a preventive effect against dementia but thats not to say that nonmusicians are totally out of luck HannaPladdy said  Music is becoming a hot area of study because its easier to quantify the number of years that people play music than for instance the length of time reading or playing games  This is just meant to be a model for cognitive stimulation and how cognitively stimulating activities can change your brain HannaPladdy said  So music may be good for you but so may other pastimes  After all violinist Frank Iacono and his wife Mary  married for  years  play Scrabble together every night  For patients who already have dementia music can be used in a different way to help the mind   The emotional response that people get from listening to music and the   that get released in the process are distinct from the structural changes in the brain that playing music over time may instigate scientists said  Trends emerging from research show that music exposure  whether through casual listening or more formalized    can help reduce the incidences of behavioral issues and generally calm dementia patients said Beth Kallmyer vice president for constituent services at the Alzheimers Association Anecdotally what we hear is that people can be upset even a little agitated and when theyre listening to music even in the late stages people can appreciate music Kallmyer said  Family members should help caregivers choose music that is meaningful to a person with dementia she said The most important thing is keeping your interventions personcentered as much as possible Naomi Ziv of the College of Management Academic Studies in Rishon LeZion Israel and her colleagues showed in a Journal of Music Therapy study that background music is associated with an increase in positive behaviors  laughing smiling talking  a decrease in negative ones including aggressiveness and crying Music attracts attention it also enhances focus and affects emotion Ziv told CNN in an email  When we hear familiar and preferred music we mentally follow it she said It seems that whereas general memory deteriorates in dementia memory for music remains relatively intact  Familiar or preferred music evokes memories and influences mood which is perhaps the underlying reason for these results Ziv said  Catherine Shmerling appreciates the effect that certain musical events have had on her father Dr Sanford A Shmerling  The elder Shmerling used to be the medical director of the William Breman Jewish Home in Atlanta now he lives there He has Alzheimers and most of his speech is not comprehensible his daughter said  On a recent weekend a swing band performed at the nursing home At first the former medical director sat in his wheelchair staring into space but soon his daughter noticed him clapping his feet She started swinging his arm with the music and after a few minutes he gave her a cute little smile  Its gratifying Catherine Shmerling said There is something about  I dont know the music or the auditory or something  that does seem to get past whatever it is thats blocking their normal communication and somehow it gets in there Science may not have all the answers but Shmerling savors these small signs that her father is listening
