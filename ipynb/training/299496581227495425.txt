Treatment forced the mother of two through menopause leaving her hormones reeling Stress and selfdoubt created problems with her husband of  years  She also suffered from vaginal stenosis a narrowing of the vaginal passage so severe that intercourse was impossible As her primary care physician explained she was basically a BAV born again virgin I was  when I was diagnosed  when I received my bone marrow transplant said Michelle who asked not to be identified by her full name due to the personal details shes revealing I wasnt ready to give up on a very important part of my wellbeing  that being my sexuality There are  million cancer survivors living in the United States the   there will be  million by  Survivors face many longterm effects of treatment from secondary cancers to cardiovascular problems to cognitive defects But the debilitating effects on a patients sexuality are often ignored said Sharon Bober director of the   at the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston   Bobers program is one of a handful of sexualityfocused survivorship programs that have popped up at cancer centers around the country  Bober was inspired to start the program when she realized many of her patients  adult survivors of pediatric cancers  were struggling with sexual issues and had no idea where to go for help  Radiation chemotherapy hormone therapy and surgery all have the capacity to affect sexual function significantly Bober said    young breast cancer survivors reported skin sensitivity vaginal dryness genital pain premature menopause fertility issues and extreme fatigue Their scores on a sexual health test were also lower than the general populations indicating problems with sexual desire arousal attaining orgasm and relationship satisfaction    These symptoms are common for cancer patients Bober said Men face many of the same issues in addition to erectile dysfunction   The side effects dont stop when treatment stops Bober and her colleagues recently completed a study of  young adult cancer survivors a significant number of them talked about longterm sexual problems years after their therapies were complete  Imagine dealing with all the normal teenage development changes on top of dealing with cancer  Many pediatric cancer survivors feel uncomfortable even dating Bober said   Adult cancer survivors can also be apprehensive about the bedroom Hormonal changes from chemotherapy and radiation often lower a patients sex drive And many face selfconfidence issues posttreatment  Right next to the wigs and prosthetics in DanaFarbers patient store are vibrators and lubricants which Bober said helps normalize the personal products she advocates using Bober works with a team of doctors to provide whatever services her patients need whether its couples therapy or education on vaginal health after early menopause   Bobers program helped Michelle understand what had happened to her sexuality  both physically and mentally She not only provided us with the emotional tools to overcome the changes we experienced she also encouraged me to use tools to help my body get its groove back Michelle said  I will often joke that I never expected vibrators to be prescribed But they were absolutely necessary  Most of Bobers patients are simply grateful to learn that theres nothing wrong with them or their relationships Although studies have shown   in happiness and quality of life its not something doctors discuss often Bober said  We live in a culture that does not support or facilitate honest and frank conversations about sex anyway she said Lots of people assume that because no one says anything about it this is just the price that they have to pay  No one knows about Americas behindcloseddoors policy on sex better than Patty Brisben coauthor of   and founder of Pure Romance the worlds largest inhome party company specializing in bedroom accessories    As an advocate for sexual health awareness Brisben often does group presentations Usually she conducts a minute questionandanswer session at the end of her talk Several years ago a group of young cancer survivors held her captive with questions for more than two hours  Women that are  and  years old who never had that first sexual experience  doctors telling them to buy bedroom toys to stimulate so atrophy wouldnt set in Brisben remembers They asked Patty what does that mean    That was the start of Pure Romances   program Consultants from the company meet with cancer survivors to talk about combating dryness with lubricants and using other toys to enhance sexual pleasure  It has a lot to do with education Brisben said Its so important to provide a safe platform where women can ask questions Brisben teaches her employees not to sugarcoat anything Its a long journey she said and each cancer survivor needs to learn to stand up for herself sexuality cant be a dirty word  You truly have to be your own disciple she said Women will demand when it comes to our children or our significant others but we dont demand for our bodies  Michelles husband was a trouper through her cancer treatment she said but the couple had difficulty reconnecting in the bedroom With her symptoms her husband had trouble keeping an erection out of fear of hurting her  She remembers thinking He must be so traumatized  He only sees me now as a frail being and not as the woman I used to be Cancer can test any relationship said   Its not uncommon for cancer patients to become depressed and question their life path he said which a partner can find hard to relate to  Ultimately of course when youre in the midst of a battle of cancer you really are focused on survival he said But as you resume your life you want to resume all aspects of your life And sexuality becomes a key factor  Kerner recommends couples start slow Act like two people in love again instead of patient and caregiver by going out on date nights and cuddling in front of the fire   Make your sexuality an ongoing conversation he said Your newfound intimacy might not necessarily be sex in the way it once was  you have to find a new version of sex that works for you   Recovering from cancer youre often not talking about weeks or months Kerner said Youre talking about years Michelle has been in remission since March  Shes adjusting to life as a survivor volunteering at DanaFarber to help others who are dealing with similar emotional scars  Im striving to get back on track with normalcy she said in every facet of my life
