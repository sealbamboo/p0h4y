I ate the best meat Ive ever eaten through a straw When the Singaporean food stall proprietor whod just served me a plate  of bones first offered the straw I refused I didnt want to take any shortcuts as I worked the tastiest bits of marrow out from the skeletal hollows But a couple of minutes into my repast my face smeared with the viscous broth the bones had come in I couldnt face the thought of leaving some of this food unexploited So I took the proffered straw inserted it down into a bone cavity and inhaled It tasted like the first bite of an excellent steak only more so Unlike biting into a ribeye when that initial sensation gives way to something less exultant and chewier the marrow lingered on the tongue I felt as if I was mainlining glutamate the substance responsible for   These bones had been cooked for hours in a fluorescent red amalgam of tomato and chili   as this dish is called in Singapore is Malay for bone soup I ate it at Deen Tulang Specialist one of a handful of stalls specializing in the dish in the   one of many food courts known as hawker centers in Singapore Even as I eagerly gobbled at the bones in front of me I turned a question over in my head Just what was it that made the bones so good Humans have been eating marrow for as long as weve been around Indeed some paleoanthropologists   that eating marrow is part of what made us become human This school of thought is based largely on bones and stone tools from about  million years ago found in the Olduvai  gorge in presentday Tanzania Fossils found there suggest that early humans scavenged carcasses already picked apart by other carnivores and using tools broke open the bones and sucked out the marrow Because marrow is very fatty it is calorically dense so the effort required to break open the bones was worth it In the West marrow somehow evolved into an aristocratic food In  Nina Edwards mentions a recipe used at Henry Vs court involving a beef marrowstuffed steak rolled up like a pancake and sweetened with honey Queen Victoria she says ate roasted bone marrow on a daily basis In more recent times Fergus Henderson a chef in London who was in the forefront of nosetotail eating popularized a   of roast beef bone marrow with parsley served with toast These sorts of preparations are delicious but they treat marrow as a delicate rare thing like caviar or foie gras Yet marrow today as it was in prehistoric times is plentiful The  vendors in Singapore sell it by the bone  it works out to just over a US dollar for each one Its not a pricey food by Singaporean standards though it is a delicacy A similar soup by the same name can be found in Malaysia but the preparation I had at Deens is uniquely Singaporean It is a specialty  of the   or Indian Muslim community in Singapore who make up a small percentage of the population Aside from the hawker center where I had it there are a handful of other food stalls and restaurants in the citystate that serve it Compared with the marrow Id eaten before which was lightly spiced the marrow in the   soup tasted more intense  the fattiness of the marrow rounded out the chili tomato fennel cumin and ginger Marrow because it is less widely consumed than flesh these days hasnt been thoroughly studied by flavor scientists There is one guy however who has his PhD in bone marrow Belayet Choudhury His    Volatile and nonvolatile components of beef marrow bone stocks is great reading Part of marrows flavor Choudhury explains comes from the Maillard reaction in which sugars react with amino acids this is the same thing that causes a nice crust to develop on steaks cooked over high heat Bone marrow he writes is almost  percent fat and only about  percent protein with the rest being moisture There are at least  different fatty acids present and about  amino acids When bone marrow is cooked the large number of acids create even larger numbers of volatile compounds through a series of chemical reactions the Maillard reaction and oxidation being the most important ones The newly created volatile compounds interact with the nonvolatiles to bring about the marrows rich taste Choudhury set out to find what compounds endow marrow not just with its pronounced umami but also with its mouthfulness and taste continuity He performed a series of experiments to  single out exactly what was in the stock finding a number of volatile compounds that hadnt previously been identified that he wrote provide characteristic aroma and overall flavor  an adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard and the science editor of Americas Test Kitchen says that the many nucleotides present in bone marrow amplify the umami taste of glutamate by as much as  to  times Crosby reminded me that the function of bone marrow is to produce red blood cells Because it is in effect a factory for the creation of cells Crosby says bone marrow is like an egg a perfect food Its got everything in it needed to create and sustain life And its true Marrow tastes wholesome in a way that other similarly rich foods like butter dont It has some of everything you need Just as cold pure water from a mountain spring quenches thirst this soup the marrow tempered with spice and made resilient by tomato seems to me as close as any substance can be to the tangible opposite of hunger I liked grappling with the bones not immune to imagined kinship with cavemen who hunted beasts and gnawed on their prey But my variety of carnivorous experience is distant from theirs The fact is once I gave in and sucked at the marrow through a straw the implement children use to drink I got at more of it It was a reminder that Im not that much less powerless than a toddler
