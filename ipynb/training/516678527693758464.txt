To improve global health you can track sneezes Or you can track bullets Thats what Rodrigo Guerrero did after he became mayor of Cali Colombia in  an era when the South American nation led the world in intentional homicides  per  people Not only did he bring down the murder rate but now he is being rewarded for his efforts Monday Guerrero became the first winner of the   a  award given by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington to someone who used evidence to have an impact on health Guerrero had no idea that guns would become a defining issue I wasnt really interested in violence says the Harvardtrained physician now  who had previously worked as an epidemiologist and president of the citys university Thats not to say he was oblivious Homicides were on his radar But his priority as a new mayor was to improve public health Once we obtained and crosschecked records we saw that homicides were the No  one cause of death well beyond chronic and contagious diseases Guerrero says In Cali the nations thirdlargest metropolis the medical examiner recorded about five murders a day and the homicide rate was five times greater than a decade ago Taking a lesson from his Harvard training Guerrero led an unbiased clinical examination of the killings He mimicked what doctors do when confronted with a disease outbreak Violence   in urban areas and the key is to find the source Rodrigo gathered professionals from different arenas physicians statisticians pathologists and police forces says Oscar Rojas an epidemiologist who worked with Guerrero in the organization later   or DESEPAZ Drug cartels seemed the likely scapegoat since their rise during the s had paralleled a surge in violence among Colombias largest cities The team found that cartels had little influence on murder But the data steered them in another direction We noticed that nearly twothirds of the homicides took place on weekends says Guerrero Most of the incidents occurred after Friday paydays The team didnt think drug barons were saving their dirty work for the weekend so the researchers hunted for more clues Comparing the coroners records with police reports revealed that more than half of the cases involved alcohol or happened at bars So his administration cut access to booze and set curfews Restaurants bars and discos couldnt serve alcohol after  am during the week and  am over the weekend As you can imagine restaurant owners were not happy says Guerrero He replied Lets try this for three months If nothing happens well abandon the plan Restricting firearms became part of the plan too At the time  percent of Calis murders involved guns That meant Guerrero had to negotiate with the biggest gun vendor in Colombia  the army The army manufactures and sells firearms he explains They have been not very happy with the idea of restricting firearm use among the population But we have managed to convince them with solid data that this is a very good process With the armys OK he implemented a ban on carrying weapons on weekends and holidays Stopandfrisk checkpoints which would become so unpopular two decades later   confiscated weapons from the most dangerous parts of the city The measures worked Murders dropped from  in  to  in   a  percent decline DESEPAZ continued to influence crime policy even after Guerreros term ended in  A decade later Calis murder rate per  people had been cut in half Meanwhile other cities have copied DESEPAZs approach in Bogota homicides dropped by twothirds The recognition belongs to the method rather than individual said Guerrero of the prize he received And hes back on the case  reelected Cali mayor in  after the murders climbed again owing to beefs between    He has since cut the murder rate from  per  to  per  That is a substantial reduction but still unacceptably high he says When I was young Cali was a very peaceful small town so the reduction of homicide is now a personal challenge for me
