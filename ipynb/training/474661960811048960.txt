A green blob that resembled an infant toy was a hit at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting Â Not only was it a popular giveaway  some  doctors and other attendees pocketed the tiny chotchka  but BristolMyers Squibb used it as a prop to explain how its cancer drugs can harness the bodys immune system to combat disease Despite giving away what was clearly a unique item a BristolMyers spokeswoman said the drug maker believes the blobs are worth less than  and therefore was not required to file reports indicating something of value had been given to physicians Such disclosures are now required of the pharmaceutical industry as a result of the Sunshine provision of health care reform
