It was a rainy night in October when my nephew Lewis passed the Frankenstein statue standing in front of a toy store The  yearold boy didnt see the monster at first and when he turned around he was only inches from Frankensteins green face bloodshot eyes and stitchedup skin The foottall monster terrified my nephew so much that he ran deep into the toy store And on the way back out he simply couldnt face the statue He jumped into his mothers arms and had to bury his head in her shoulder For hours after the incident Lewis was stuck He kept replaying the image of Frankensteins face in his mind Mom remember Frankenstein he asked over and over again He and his mom talked about how scary the statue was how Lewis had to jump into her arms It was like a record loop my sister said But then suddenly Lewis story completely changed My sister was recounting the tale to the family how they left the store how they had to walk by Frankenstein And then  I peed on him Lewis blurted out triumphantly with a glint in his eyes In that instant Lewis had overpowered Frankenstein  if only in his mind Well your nephew is a brilliant story editor says psychologist   of the University of Virginia Wilson has been studying how small changes in a persons own stories and memories can help with emotional health He calls the process   And he says small tweaks in the interpretation of life events can reap huge benefits This process is essentially what happens during months or years of therapy But Wilson has discovered ways you can change your story in only about  minutes Wilson first stumbled on the technique back in the early s when he found that a revised story helped college students who were struggling academically Im bad at school was the old story many of them were telling themselves That story leads to a selfdefeating cycle that keeps them struggling Wilson says The new story Wilson gave them was Everyone fails at first He introduced the students to this idea by having them read accounts from other students who had struggled with grades at first and then improved It was a minute intervention that had   three years later The ones who got our little storyediting nudge improved their grades whereas the others didnt Wilson says And to our surprise  those who got our storyediting intervention were more likely to stay in college The people in the control group were more likely to drop out Similar interventions have also helped students feel like they   socially at college and have helped parents to stop abusing their kids The idea is that if you believe you are something else  perhaps smarter more socially at ease  you can allow for profound changes to occur You can even try storyediting yourself at home with   Simply pick a troubling event And write about it for  minutes each day for four days Thats it These exercises have been shown to help relieve mental anguish improve health and increase attendance at work No one is sure why the approach works But Wilsons theory is that trying to understand why a painful event happened is mentally consuming People get stuck in thinking Why did he leave me or Why was she so disappointed in me Or for Lewis Where did that scary Frankenstein face come from As you write about the troubling confusing event again and again eventually you begin to make sense of it You can put those consuming thoughts to rest So as you look forward to changing yourself this year consider looking back on whatever your Frankensteins may be And if you squint your eyes a little and turn your head just a bit you may see that your leg was lifted That maybe you did pee on him after all
