Biathlon may be the toughest endurance sport in the Olympics After grueling circuits of Nordic skiing athletes have to calm their breathing steady their tired legs and shoot tiny targets with a rifle Andy Soule does it all with only his arms Its a steep learning curve learning to sitski says Soule a member of the US Paralympic team Hes strapped into a seat attached to two fixed crosscountry skis He speeds along the course by hauling himself with ski poles Soule who will begin the Paralympic biathlon competition Saturday in Sochi Russia lost his legs to a roadside bomb in Afghanistan while deployed with the US Army in  He tried a few different sports as part of his rehab and in  on a whim he borrowed a rifle and tried a biathlon race I hit two of my  shots maybe  very shaky he recalls with a laugh Shaky or not Soule caught the attention of Team USA and at the  Vancouver Paralympics became the only American ever to win a medal in biathlon  in either the Paralympics or the ablebodied games Soule is modest about his medal and his marksmanship he was also rated an expert with a rifle during his Army career Hes not the only American in the Paralympics who learned to shoot in the military Another is Dan Cnossen who is still active duty in the Navy I wanted to move and shoot like I used to he says Cnossen was leading a Navy SEAL platoon in Afghanistan when a bomb cost him both his legs in  The damage was severe and recovery was tough At first all he could focus on was improving a little each day At one point improvement was sitting up out of bed  because I hadnt for weeks  and my balance was all gone he says They had to hold me and let go and Id fall back down But I always focus on the next steps and the next thing you know Im running Cnossen started running on prosthetic blades then tried skiing  and then made the US team for Sochi The advantage for a Navy SEAL like Cnossen is that he has the skills to ski his fastest right up to the target range and then calm down quickly and shoot Other military habits   help In combat Cnossen says he needed to be aware of everything around him At the biathlon thats all distraction Im so aware of other skiers people cheering the announcer talking  I need to tune that out but its hard he says You just have to focus on those five shots on that little black circle Of course Cnossen would still rather be leading Navy SEALs But for sports he says the biathlon might be as close as it gets I can move and shoot I can be on a team he says I can travel train hard for a goal  seems like a pretty good transition
