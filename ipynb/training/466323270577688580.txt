Paul Siperke is the coowner of   a popular brewpub in Cleveland He has fewer than  fulltime employees so hes classified under the Affordable Care Act as a small business He   provide health insurance to his employees but thats what hes been doing since the bar opened in  despite some pretty dramatic volatility in rates They just seemed to keep going up every year he says One year we got a  percent increase another year we got  One year we got  This year under the Affordable Care Act he saw another hike  this one about  percent It just seems odd that we get such a drastic price increase when nothing has really changed with us as far as our employees and health issues he says Most of the workers at Fat Heads are in their s and s They are healthy enthusiastic about their jobs and grateful for health coverage Until now if employees were healthy and claims were few as they are at Fat Heads the companys cost of insuring those employees was relatively low But for a small business if even one employee was in a car accident or was diagnosed with cancer the amount the insurance company charged the firm to cover those employees could skyrocket the next year The insurance industry calls this   and   under the health law says Steve Millard who heads a smallbusiness association in Cleveland If youre a really healthy company and have a really good rate relative to everybody else today youre probably going to pay a lot more for insurance going forward he says but on the flip side if you have chronic conditions and difficulties and an older workforce and are paying a lot more youll probably see some benefit in health care reform This means more businesses will see their insurance costs go up than down at least in the short term The   the regional support group for small businesses that Miller heads estimates about  percent of smaller companies in northeast Ohio are seeing some sort of price relief this year The other  percent are getting price hikes Northeast Ohio is a microcosm of what is happening nationally In February a   commissioned by Congress projected that about twothirds of small businesses across the country will see the costs of their employee health plans rise The initial sticker shock thats occurring this year or next year or the following year when plans finally have to come into ACA compliance  thats what Im really worried about says   the manager for legislative affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business Im worried that smallbusiness owners will not be able to continue offering policies because the costs are too high Were in a transition period says   a health economist at MIT It will sting at first he says but once were in this system were not going to see that yeartoyear variability weve seen traditionally Were not going to see these huge swings year to year  one of your employees gets sick and all of a sudden your rates double That goes away now The main thing Gruber says is were moving to a system that is going to be much more stable But bar owner Siperke says hes frustrated I always thought that health reform was needed of some type he says It just seems like  they botched it Still Siperke says hes committed to providing health insurance to his workers  and so far the increase is a financial hit he can handle
