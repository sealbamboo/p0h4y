Do ecigarettes lure teens into a world of vice that turns them into smokers of regular cigarettes This is the big fear of antismoking activists and new data from Hawaii suggest they may be right A survey of  ninth and thgraders from Oahu found that  of them had tried electronic cigarettes at least once and that  of them had used the devices in the last month according to a   published Monday by the journal Pediatrics These figures represent a substantial jump from ecigarette smoking rates reported in earlier years The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions   for instance found that  of US teens had tried ecigarettes in  up from  in  The fact that nearly  in  high school freshmen and sophomores in Hawaii had used the batterypowered devices was only part of the story Among these students  had also tried regular cigarettes the survey results showed The researchers tried to come up with a psychological profile of these electronic cigarette users to see whether they would have been likely to steer clear of tobacco products if ecigarettes didnt exist To that end their survey asked students whether they like to do things that are a little frightening and whether they like to break the rules among other questions Compared with kids who had never used ecigarettes the ones who had used both ecigarettes and regular were more likely to take risks and less likely to score well on measures of behavioral and emotional selfcontrol the researchers found These dualuse students were also less likely to be focused on school and to have supportive engaged parents who might steer them away from risky activities such as smoking The students who had used ecigarettes but not regular cigarettes occupied an intermediate spot on the risk spectrum between the nonusers and the dual users according to the study That pattern was in line with the theory that teens try ecigarettes because they are curious about them and see them as a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes Having crossed that hurdle they become vulnerable to cigarette smoking the researchers wrote However the data are also consistent with the theory that teens who use ecigarettes are also inclined use regular cigarettes marijuana and alcohol because they provide a means of rebelling against conventional values as well as pleasant physical sensations the study authors wrote In this view ecigarette use is merely a step on a path to problem behavior that the students were likely to follow anyway  and indeed of the  of students who had smoked regular cigarettes  had used ecigarettes as well In the end the Hawaii data cant answer the key question of whether lowrisk youth are being recruited to cigarette smoking by being exposed to ecigarettes and acquiring perceptions and attitudes favorable to smoking the study authors concluded Until indepth tracking studies can provide the muchneeded answers the idea that ecigarettes are a gateway drug must be considered in the ongoing debate about regulating ecigarettes they wrote
