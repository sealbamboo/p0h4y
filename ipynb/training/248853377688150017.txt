Why would a billionaire energy traderturnedphilanthropist throw his foundations dough behind a new think tank that wants to challenge scientific assumptions about obesity John Arnold  whose move from Enron to a spectacularly successful hedge fund got him on  of wealthiest Americans isnt crazy about talking to the press But certainly his decision with his wife Laura to back a newly launched operation called the   or NuSI is an intriguing one Obesity and all the dietary confusion that swirls around it is clearly a problem that   But NuSI says largescale scientific studies that tackle fundamental questions  like how food really affects fat hormones and the brain  are whats needed to solve it more than anything else Were told by NuSIs president   a Stanford and Johns Hopkinstrained doctor that Arnolds interest in the cause started with a podcast featuring science journalist and NuSI cofounder   Taubes has been arguing for the last several years in books and   in the   that current dietary guidelines and beliefs about what has caused the obesity epidemic are wrong and based on poor science Attia says Arnold approached Taubes after Arnold realized he could bring resources to bear on the problem   million in seed money to fund good studies that are usually prohibitively expensive In  nutrition science the research is inadequate so our guiding information is not based on rigorous science Meredith Johnson a spokeswoman for the John and Laura Arnold Foundation told The Salt in an email One reason Attia agrees its inadequate is that its really quite difficult to study nutrition in humans at the level of precision that scientists in other fields can get Ideally researchers could control everything their subjects eat over weeks and months and monitor the effects of different foods or diets on the body But thats the kind of research thats very costly In the absence of it researchers often rely on the subjects to selfreport what they ate  which ultimately can be misleading because peoples memory of their exact food intake is notoriously bad With Arnolds contributions NuSI says it will be able to give money to the best nutrition researchers in the country doing the most cutting edge research The hope is to enable these researchers do much bigger nuanced studies than what they can currently afford to do with the fiveyear  million National Institutes of Health grants most of them rely on We want to get to the moon in other words we want to discover the perfect set of rules and understand what controls obesity and the metabolic syndrome he says When they get there NuSI claims theyll have the tools to lower the obesity prevalence rate in the US from  percent to  percent and the diabetes rate from  percent to  percent Their goal is to do this by  That would translate into billions in health care savings too NuSI has attracted some big names to its board of advisers ranging from James Lambright of the US Treasury Department and the   to hour lifestyle guru   In his typically hyperbolic prose Ferriss   NuSi an Xmenlike group of the worlds best scientists independently funded and uninfluenced by industry tackling the most important questions in nutrition That NuSIs studies will not be dependent on the food industry is significant  many nutrition and obesity researchers nowadays have nowhere to turn but the industry to test new ideas See Allison Aubreys   on probiotics in yogurt for one example of that Industry backing can make consumers and others skeptical of their findings sometimes with good reason The Arnold Foundations support of NuSI falls under its   the foundation also fund projects looking for solutions to criminal justice education and public accountability problems Will NuSI really be able to silence all the chatter out there once and for all about the best diet to stay healthy Seems like a pretty lofty goal but certainly a Manhattan Project for nutrition is worth a shot
