What would it take to persuade you to allow government researchers to squirt millions of live flu viruses up your nose A recently concluded project at the National Institutes of Health found among other things that  each was enough to attract plenty of volunteers I am happy I could contribute in some way says Kelli Beyer  one of  healthy people who volunteered for the project To get the money the research subjects had to commit to several days of testing then nine days in a hospital isolation ward once the virus was administered in a nasal spray All the subjects got varying amounts of a laboratorysynthesized version of the HN strain of swine flu that touched off a   back in  that sickened millions and contributed to the deaths of more than  people Since one aim of the study was to see how much virus it takes to make people moderately sick researchers ramped up the dose given to seven successive groups of volunteers Beyer was in the last of seven groups so she got the highest dose More on what happened to her later First you might be wondering why scientists felt they needed to give people the flu Despite  years of studying influenza we still have somewhat limited knowledge of how flu causes disease in humans study director Matthew Memoli tells Shots These kinds of studies have been done before but not since the early s Memoli an infectious disease specialist at NIHs clinical center   that  to  percent of the population gets the flu each year He says that only by deliberately infecting people with known quantities of a known flu virus can researchers understand how that virus behaves In this study we know exactly when they were exposed exactly when they got sick Memoli says And theres a lot of other important stuff too such as how long after infection people become contagious how long theyre contagious what the virus does to different tissues in the body and how the body fights it off Memoli presented the first results of the study at a meeting of the   in Denver He says science has changed a lot in the two decades since these kinds of experiments called challenge studies were last done with flu The term signifies that volunteers are challenged with a microbe to see what happens We have new tools for studying the immune response he says We can look at gene expression  when you get infected with a virus what genes in your body get turned on or off  which we couldnt look at  years ago Advances in genetics also allow scientists to track the ways viruses evolve inside peoples bodies once an infection gets going Scientists also have better tools for measuring peoples immune response to flu      that summon and activate immune cells what specific   and   get activated All this Memoli says helps development of more effective vaccines and antiviral medicines against influenza One thing the recent study showed is how much virus is required to produce mild to moderate illness The answer is a technical one  million TCIDs That is  million times the amount of virus it takes to kill  percent of human cells cultivated in laboratory dishes The term stands for Tissue Culture Infective Dose So how many viruses is that exactly This is extraordinarily difficult to measure and anyone who gave you an answer to that question would be making very big assumptions Memoli says Suffice it to say that at least  million viral particles of the  HN influenza bug is enough to cause mild to moderate illness in  percent of people who get that dose One practical use of that information Scientists now know for this viral strain anyway that  percent of unvaccinated people will get sick when they get this dose So any candidate vaccine has to lower that rate substantially to be considered effective The study showed that people begin shedding flu virus in their secretions between  and  hours after exposure They began showing symptoms anywhere from one to five days after exposure By the ninth day they were no longer contagious Soon Memoli plans to begin another series of challenge experiments this time involving  volunteers to identify what protects humans from flu What levels of which antibodies to the proteins on the viral surface make a difference It wouldnt be safe or ethical by the way to involve elderly people or children in such experiments By studying healthy people we can learn whats missing in those who are elderly or young or have immune problems Memoli says That might lead to vaccines designed to prop up these folks more effectively A little further down the road Memoli plans to do challenge studies with a different strain of flu now circulating called HN that tends to cause more severe disease He hopes to figure out why And so what happened to Kelli Beyer after she got her dose of millionplus flu viruses Nothing too terrible Honestly if I hadnt known it was HN I would probably have assumed it was any old cold she tells Shots I was tired had a runny nose spiked a fever If I were outside the NIH I would probably have taken some overthecounter medicine and gone to work It wasnt bad enough she says to induce her to get a flu shot this fall though she says she might if she had more contact with children or elderly people
