Ashoka Mukpo the NBC News freelancer who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia and was declared virusfree Tuesday after treatment in the United States says hes still feeling the effects of his battle with the disease  but doesnt regret his decision to work there I mean theres definitely some physical effects of this that I think are gonna last a while But I can feel my strength coming back every day Mukpo  told NBC News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday And I mean there was a period of time that I was quite sick And you know I was laying in a hospital bed and had no strength Had various pains And  and just all kinds of fun stuff going on in my body Mukpo doesnt know exactly how and when he contracted the deadly disease in the weeks prior to his diagnosis in early October Thats the million dollar question And unfortunately theres not a satisfactory answer for it he said A blood test confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday showed that Mukpo  one of eight Americans to have been diagnosed with Ebola  no longer has the virus in his bloodstream and was free to head home to Rhode Island Mukpo first went into the Nebraska Medical Center on Oct  after being flown from the Liberian capital of Monrovia on a specially outfitted plane In his treatment Mukpo received the antiviral medication Brincidofovir and blood from Dr Kent Brantly the first American who was flown back to the US after contracting the virus For me to kind of know that I got sick and then was so fortunate to receive the kind of care that I got when so many people have nothing even approximating slightly that kind of care  you know its a heavy feeling I dont know if guilt is the right word But it  it just feels like something isnt right about that said Mukpo And he said while the experience will make him consider taking less risks in the future he doesnt regret going to Liberia to cover the outbreak that has killed more than  people worldwide mostly in the West African nations of Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea I mean you know as a journalist and as somebody who had a relationship to that country its not something that I will look back on and say you know it was the wrong decision to do he said I mean I think its important in life to take risks for things that you believe in But its also important to keep yourself safe So I mean its hard to call Ebola a learning experience But I think that Im gonna walk away from this with some important lessons for the future
