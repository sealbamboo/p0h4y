In the US   has become a routine part of womens health care and its dramatically reduced cervical cancer deaths But in Africa and other impoverished regions few women get pap smears because the countries lack the laboratories and other resources necessary to offer them The World Health Organization   that more than  percent of deaths from cervical cancer now occur in lowincome nations Thus theres a push to come up with a new lowtech way to screen women for cervical cancer in the developing world Now doctors think a bit of vinegar may be a solution We have already seen that the pap smear hasnt worked as a public health intervention for preventing cervical cancer in low and middleincome countries   an obstetriciangynecologist with the international health group   which is associated with Johns Hopkins University Lu is promoting a cervical cancer screening technique in which a nurse or a midwife simply swabs a womans cervix with vinegar or diluted acetic acid and then looks with the naked eye or a magnifying glass for precancerous lesions The screening technique requires only vaginal spoons vinegar and a bit of training It can be performed in the simplest health clinics without a need for laboratory tests or even electricity In the developing world Lu says public health providers need a cervical cancer screening tool that is fast easy and inexpensive We need a test that is simple practical and good enough to identify precancerous lesions he says And then also its critical that it is available where women come for health care When a health care provider spots a precancerous lesion with the vinegar test it can often be removed immediately and the entire procedure takes only a few minutes At least six countries in Africa have now adopted the technique as part of their public health care systems and its also caught on in Thailand and parts of Asia Doreen RamogolaMasire an obstetriciangynecologist in Botswana is using a similar approach One of the key elements of the technique she says is that women can be tested and treated in a single visit RamogolaMasire simply swabs a womans cervix with vinegar and then looks for any potentially cancerous lesions which appear as white tissue If precancerous lesions are present she freezes them with nitrous oxide Shes lying on the couch RamogolaMasire says You look at the cervix you wash it with vinegar You take a picture You can immediately review the picture because youve got a screen So you can say to them this is the white change I think this is where the abnormality is We are going to freeze it What happens is the freezing actually takes care of the top layer You just sluff that off And hopefully youve taken care of the problem Almost all cervical cancer is caused by the   There appears to be higher rates of HPV and cervical cancer among women with HIV RamogolaMasire says Botswana has one of the   in the world with nearly a quarter of all adults believed to be HIV positive In the early days of the AIDS epidemic RamogolaMasire says cervical cancer wasnt much of a concern because women with HIV werent living long enough for the cancer to develop Once cervical cancer has spread its difficult to treat particularly in poor countries with limited health resources If caught early cervical cancer is easily treatable If not RamogolaMasire says its a terrible death It invades you nerves at the spine at the back so you are in a lot of pain she says The other thing is that because theres a lot of dead tissue you smell Theres a lot of bleeding Youre incontinent Youre in pain youre bleeding  I think its just a horrible disease to die from RamogolaMasire hopes that the widespread adoption of cervical cancer screening with vinegar in the developing world can help prevent those horrible deaths
