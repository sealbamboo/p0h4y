Once again, the working week will soon come to a close. And you thought this moment may never occur, yes? As you know, this is our signal to start daydreaming about weekend doings. We look forward to watching one of the short people pitch in a championship game, tidying up the Pharmalot satellite campus and promenading with the official mascots. And you? Anything special planned? This is a lovely time to enjoy the outdoors. You could fill in your summer calendar before it’s too late. Or simply plan the rest of your life. Whatever you do, have a grand time, and be safe. See you soon…. Meanwhile, we’re reading about pharma executives based in China who are so worried about the government probe into marketing practices that some are looking to take short-term assignments else or transfer out of the country permanently. And Merck and Pfizer may come out winners if the U.S. Supreme Court sets a higher standard for shareholders to win class-action status in securities lawsuits claiming companies did not adequately disclose information. A ruling is expected within two weeks.
