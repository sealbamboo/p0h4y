Medical overtreatment is the inverse of former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewarts definition of pornography While waste is easy to define in principle it can be hard to know it when you see it A treatment that is appropriate for one patient can also be unnecessary or even counterproductive for another depending on the patients condition This has been a major obstacle for studies seeking to pinpoint overused services which by the most expansive estimates may account for as much as a third of the nations health spending Using a novel method a   released Monday by researchers from the Harvard Medical School Department of Health Care Policy evaluated the prevalence in Medicare of  tests and procedures that have been found to offer little or no clinical benefit The services were mostly culled from mainstream lists including studies in medical journals the   and the   The procedures included a form of back surgery in which collapsed spinal disks are filled with cement as well as CT scans or MRIs on people with headaches The study published in the journal   concluded that at least  in  Medicare beneficiaries received one of these  lowvalue services during  and possibly significantly more Two of the researchers Aaron Schwartz and Dr J Michael McWilliams said in an interview the total number of unnecessary treatments was surely higher since their study encompassed just  tests and procedures There are hundreds of other lowvalue services said McWilliams a Harvard professor The researchers took a twostep approach First they analyzed Medicare billing records to isolate services provided to patients where they might not be warranted For example when tallying the number of surgeries to remove plaque from a carotid artery in the neck they focused on patients who did not have any history of symptoms of ministrokes The researchers calculated that there were  million instances of the  lowvalue treatments during  Fortytwo percent of beneficiaries received at least one such service costing Medicare  billion or  percent of spending To err on the side of caution the researchers then analyzed the records a second time using the most restrictive definitions they could devise In reexamining the frequency of the carotid surgeries for instance they excluded operations that were associated with an emergency room visit because that might indicate the patient was having a stroke They also looked only at female patients because there is evidence this procedure known as a carotid endarterectomy is   With the more selective filter the amount Medicare potentially wasted on that surgery dropped from  million to  million The frequency of other procedures dropped by an even greater degree The researchers initially found that out of every  patients with general back pain  received an imaging test When the researchers limited their search to back scans of patients with no diagnoses in the billing records that might possibly justify the scan such as a fever cancer or drug use they identified  instances for every  beneficiaries The dollar figure those back scans cost Medicare shrank from  million to  million But even with the more specific definitions the researchers calculated that  million lowvalue services were provided in  with  percent of Medicare beneficiaries receiving at least one Those services cost Medicare  billion or  percent of overall spending The study found significant amounts of spending on lowvalue services even in parts of the country where they were least frequent They wrote that overuse may be substantial even among more efficient providers However it is not clear how often those services were being provided in the four years since the time examined by the study when overtreatment received more attention within the medical profession The Choosing Wisely campaign for instance did not begin until  The researchers said that the wide gap between how many inappropriate services were detected using the broader versus the limited method illustrated how difficult it may be to try to police the appropriateness of specific treatments Instead they recommended that reforms focus on moving away from paying doctors and hospitals for each service they provide Instead they wrote giving caregivers set sums to treat a patients overall health  known as global payments  or socalled   to treat one particular episode such as replacement of a knee and the subsequent rehabilitation could allow greater provider discretion in defining and identifying lowvalue services while incentivizing their elimination There are several such efforts being tried Massachusetts is   The federal Center for Medicare  Medicaid Innovation has approved several hundred bundled payment   around the country
