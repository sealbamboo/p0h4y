Nicola Oates always thought her son Thomass clumsiness as a baby was normal As he got older it became more problematic He would trip over anything lying on the floor and he started falling behind at school He also developed a habit of turning his head to the right and pointing his chin downwards when looking at something That was very odd says Nicola who lives in the Midlands He looks normal most of the time but when he focused his eyes he wanted to look out of the top of his head When he was walking hed end up bumping into walls chairs people everything It was Thomass way of stopping his eyes swinging she explains a symptom of an incurable eye movement disorder called     Referred to as wobbly eye because it causes uncontrolled eye movements nystagmus also creates lots of problems with vision Jay Self paediatric ophthalmologist at Southampton General Hospital and a senior lecturer in ophthalmic genetics at the University of Southampton says it is vitally important to find out more about the disorder because one in  people is affected in the UK It can be very disabling it can affect someones whole life which could be  to  years their working life families and future generations He describes having nystagmus as like seeing the world in strobes leaving children struggling to see moving objects and slow to recognise faces According to John Sanders from support group Nystagmus Network UK few adults with nystagmus can drive and most encounter some difficulties in every day life education and employment  Sufferers can have problems in many social situations too because they miss facial cues but these difficulties are not always picked up by standard eye tests and the true extent of their vision problems are never fully investigated Thomas for example who is now eight is not classed as visually impaired or partially sighted because he can read an opticians eye chart Despite this he needs visual aids such as magnifying blocks and lights to help him read and he needs a handrail to help him get round the house At home he wears glasses with blue tinted lenses to protect his eyes and by  hes exhausted with the effort of trying to see properly all day Nicola says Its very hard for him He cant judge how far away things are Even when he hugs me he has to stand on my feet to find out where I am At Southamptons new research centre for children with eye problems Mr Self has already started analysing hundreds of genes to discover more about what causes congenital nystagmus which appears soon after birth His aim is to develop a simple genetic test for children with nystagmus which will allow them to be diagnosed quickly and accurately He also wants to use realworld visual functioning measures  rather than eye tests  to measure the actual visual problems caused by the disorder This will mean children can receive specific tailored treatments Even without these new treatments Mr Self says there are some simple steps which can help schoolchildren with nystagmus They include getting the support of a visual impairment teacher and sitting the child on the side of the classroom which suits their field of vision Thomass eye movements were picked up by a relative when he was around eight months old but it wasnt until he was five that he was referred to his local specialist centre for treatment He had an operation to improve his eyesight a year ago and will probably have another later this year His mum Nicola has noticed improvements but he still turns his head to see where he is walking I dont know how bad his vision really is because for him its just normal he was born with it and doesnt know any different But she has realised it is up to her to fight for the help he needs Ive decided to ask more questions and stand up for him Why should he struggle He deserves more
