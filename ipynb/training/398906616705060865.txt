Some pastries lend themselves to interpretation and adaptation to whole grain variations others are best left alone in their white flour and sugar splendor Biscotti the dry Italian cookies that are twice baked which is what the name means are a kind of pastry that does They are supposed to be hard and dont have to be too sweet though most of the biscotti you find in coffee shops are  too sweet that is I had a lot of fun working with different whole grain biscotti variations this week I began with a straight all whole wheat and almond flour cookie filled with toasted almonds made with Community Grains whole wheat flour which I never hesitate to substitute for white flour in baked goods because it is so finely ground I used no more than twothirds of the amount of sugar called for in virtually all of the biscotti recipes I looked at and the sugar I used was either organic brown sugar or organic white sugar which is really more of a beige color and coarsely ground One of this weeks recipes a hazelnut orange biscotti is sweetened with honey only  I like the fact that the cookies arent too sweet theyre just sweet enough to fulfill a craving for something sweet to dip into my tea in the afternoon And some of these cookies do require dipping  into tea coffee or wine  to soften them up just a little Because I was working with ground millet buckwheat and cornmeal all glutenfree grains I decided to try my hand at a couple of glutenfree biscotti recipes and I was thrilled with the results I used a small amount of butter in these cookies to tenderize them and help hold them together and they may be my favorite batches from the weeks experiments But Im happy to have all of the results of this recipe testing around The recipes yield a lot of cookies and I had to bring out all of my Christmas cookie tins for storage I sent off a good care package to my son at boarding school as well I dont have to worry about the cookies going stale as they last for weeks  though even without Liam around I dont think these cookies will be around for that long
