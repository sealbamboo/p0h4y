A Houston woman infected her girlfriend with the AIDS virus in a rare instance of transmission through womantowoman sex doctors reported Thursday They said its very difficult to prove that a woman has infected another during sex  and very unlikely  but in this case sex that caused injury was the likely culprit The case underscores the need for everyone with HIV to get treated even if they dont believe they are likely to infect someone else One of the important messages is that this remains a rare route of transmission but its still possible says Amy Lansky who helped direct the center for HIV surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The case came to light when the newly infected woman tried to donate blood She sold plasma to supplement her income according to Shirley Chan of the Houston Department of Health and Human Services and colleagues who detailed the case in the CDCs weekly health report The woman who acquired HIV was aged  years and had a history of heterosexual intercourse but not in the  years before HIV infection the researchers wrote She reported three female sexual partners in the preceding five years but said she had no injected drug use receipt of tattoos acupuncture transfusions transplants or any other recognized HIV risk behavior She did however have a yearold girlfriend with HIV who had stopped treatment Tests showed the two were infected with genetically nearidentical virus and researchers suspected that rough sex might have drawn blood The human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS is transmitted in blood semen and breast milk People who share needles can infect one another but sex is the main route In the United States its usually male to male sex while in Africa its usually men infecting women Theres no cure and no vaccine for HIV but drug treatment can keep it under control and help keep people from infecting their sex partners A lesbian might not see the risk but its there the researchers warned The potential for HIV transmission by femaletofemale sexual contact includes unprotected exposure to vaginal or other body fluids and to blood from menstruation or to exposure to blood from trauma during rough sex they wrote Its also often the case that people fall in and out of treatment Lansky said About half of people   at some point statistics show and only a quarter of Americans infected are taking drugs regularly enough to keep their infections under control
