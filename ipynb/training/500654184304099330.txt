When people hear the words Aspergers syndrome they often think of children or Albert Einstein  even though he was never formally diagnosed But here are some things about Aspergers that are less well known Aspergers syndrome sometimes known as an autistic spectrum disorder is a lifelong disability which affects people in many different ways  While there are similarities with autism people with Aspergers syndrome have fewer problems with speaking and dont usually have the associated learning disabilities They sometimes call themselves aspies for short In recognition of the fact that their brains are wired differently people with autism and Aspergers say that they are neurountypical They call people who dont have either disability neurotypicals or NTs And thats just for starters Here are some more lesserknown or misunderstood aspects of Aspergers syndrome from those who know Although Austrian paediatrician Hans Asperger thought it only affected boys when he first described the syndrome back in  research since has found that there are likely to be a similar number of females on the spectrum  The National Autistic Society says that because of the male gender bias girls are less likely to be identified with autism spectrum disorders even when their symptoms are equally severe Many girls are never referred for diagnosis and are missed from the statistics altogether Aspergers affects females in a slightly different way Girls will have special interests but instead of building up an incredible wealth of knowledge on subjects like trains or dinosaurs  like boys with Aspergers might  they tend to like the same things as neurotypical girls their age albeit in a more focused way  For example a young girl with Aspergers might make it her business to collect all of the outfits that Barbie has ever worn Women and girls can find it easier to mask their difficulties making the condition harder to recognise It might only become obvious at around age  when the pressure to be the same as friends gets too much  Some girls with Aspergers will manage to keep their difficulties under wraps at school but might have meltdowns at home where they feel safe to relax and release the feelings that they have been squashing down all day A meltdown is where a person with autism or Aspergers temporarily loses control because of emotional responses to environmental factors They arent usually caused by one specific thing Triggers build up until the person becomes so overwhelmed that they cant take in any more information  It has been described as feeling like a can of cola that has been shaken up opened and poured out emotions flowing everywhere They can look like a common or garden tantrum but unlike tantrums meltdowns cant be stopped by giving the person their own way  Dependent on the cause of meltdown it may be best to help the person leave the situation they find distressing Everyone is different but some say that what they need to recover from a meltdown is being left alone in a place where they feel safe listening to music having a bath or sleeping  After a meltdown the person often feels ashamed embarrassed and very tired There are people with Aspergers who have a high IQ and others who dont A person on the spectrum could be better at maths then a neurotypical but some even have dyscalculia a specific difficulty with numbers The amazing abilities that some people like Raymond from the film Rain Man have with maths and dates are because of    a separate condition from Aspergers Some people on the spectrum may have it but not all It is not unusual for someone on the autism spectrum to have a cooccurring condition These range from Coeliac disease and other digestive problems to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD There is no definitive answer to why this is the case Contrary to popular belief people with Aspergers do have empathy They care about how others are thinking and feeling but they often have difficulty putting themselves in other peoples shoes This is a skill that can be learned over time  Trouble picking up how others are thinking or feeling via tone of voice or body language can make people with Aspergers appear less than empathetic when they dont mean to be The autism community talks about the double bind empathy problem This is where neurotypicals can seem less than empathetic  by failing to take into account how people with autism see the world They might ignore the fact that autistic people have a tendency to take things literally asking someone to take a seat rather than sit down A hard or soft G Like burger or like merger  With or without an apostrophe before the final s In March  Aspergers syndrome was removed from the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM Instead people with the same set of difficulties who are diagnosed using the DSM after that time are described as having an autism spectrum disorder  But people who were assessed before March  keep their original diagnosis of Aspergers syndrome  The DSM is the mental health diagnostic bible for US doctors but UK doctors tend to refer to the World Health Organisations International Classification of Diseases ICD instead  No similar change has been made to this manual and so UK doctors continue to diagnose Aspergers syndrome  The term is much used in the international autism community and is part of many peoples identities It is likely that many in the US will continue to say that they have Aspergers despite the changes Source
