In the battle to stop Ebolas spread health officials worldwide have been deploying thermometers in hopes of detecting the earliest symptoms among people who might be sick The nocontact thermometer already broadly used in some airports in Africa has come to US airports this week  now at New Yorks John F Kennedy Airport and starting Thursday at DCs Dulles Chicagos OHare Atlantas HartsfieldJackson and Newarks Liberty The goal is to detect fever for public screening purposes according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention an elevated temperature higher than  Fahrenheit if you have reason to think you might have been exposed to Ebola merits followup Of course lots of illnesses  many that are mild and others that are severe  can cause fever and checking for fever at airports didnt start with Ebola In  some Asian airports used thermometers as part of their screening of passengers for symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS And in  with prompting from the World Health Organization airports checked the temperature of some travelers looking for symptoms of HN flu As the NPR blog Goats  Soda reported   there are pros and cons to different types of temperaturetaking devices from the fairly common ear gun thermometer to the fullbody scanner The handheld notouch thermometer seems to have emerged as the most popular for Ebola screenings doctors say because its fast easy to use noninvasive pretty accurate relatively inexpensive and minimizes the chance of spreading illness Notouch thermometers were originally used in industry from manufacturing to firefighting and theyre a trusted resource says physiologist   at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Its very accurate at measuring whatever its pointed at Levine tells Shots In this case thats a forehead which doesnt precisely reflect the human bodys internal temperature but is a close enough match for the rough purposes of screening Levine says Its a quantitative way of having your mother put her hands or lips against your forehead The thermometer tells how hot a person is by measuring the infrared energy coming off the body Human skin is a very good  or very efficient  emitter of infrared energy says   chief technology officer for Sanomedics which manufactures CareGiver the brand of thermometer now being used in some airports CareGiver captures that energy coming off the body and the device is calibrated to translate that energy reading into the temperature of an object A sensor relies on a silicon lens to focus the infrared energy so the reading isnt of the wall or of your hair says OHara We want to read the temperature of a precise spot on your forehead Thats part of what differentiates a human notouch thermometer from an industrial one he says  the narrow field of view The other difference is the algorithm the machine uses in its translation Thats our special sauce says   CEO of Sanomedics CareGivers algorithm is based on data from clinical studies of patients some with fevers and some without We crunch that data and put it into a mathematical algorithm so that it converts the temperature taken from the forehead into this oral equivalent says OHara The result he says is a thermometer that matches an oral thermometer typically within twotenths of a degree and ASTM Internationals thermometer   to within fourtenths of a degree Notouch thermometers are useful in part because theyre unlikely to pass infection from person to person   to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention However the CDC also notes that this particular type of fever detector is most accurate when measuring the temperature of dry skin in a draftfree room If someone is sweating or has been in front of a fan and the forehead skin has become cool he could register at a normal temperature when he is actually running hot says Levine And of course aspirin and some other pain relievers can reduce body temperature too and mask a low fever No thermometer is perfect But for the fast pace of airport screenings health officials say if the goal is to pick up symptoms in some people before they even realize theyre sick notouch thermometers are the best bet
