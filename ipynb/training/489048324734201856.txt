NPRs Jason Beaubien is in Sierra Leone covering the Ebola outbreak that began in March in Guinea and has spread to neighboring countries Well be speaking with him throughout the week about what hes seeing on the ground Today hes in   the largest town in the countrys eastern province with a population of about  and the epicenter of Sierra Leones outbreak In the past week  staff in Kailahun have treated more than  patients with Ebolalike symptoms When we called Beaubien was with a team driving to the treatment center to pick up the body of a yearold woman who died of   Burial was scheduled for this afternoon The Ministry of Health is handing over body management to the Red Cross This is one of the first bodies theyre going out to do so theres a whole bunch of people who will be at the burial It may turn into a bit of a mob scene And theres a lot of anger in the community theres a potential that family members might not be happy that such a large group of people are showing up at the burial Theres been a lot of frustration and lack of understanding among the community about the need to not touch the body Traditional burial would include washing the body by hand So theres been some tension when the health teams come in telling people theyre not allowed to touch the body and that the body has to be zipped up in a body bag and disposed of by people in hazmat suits Theyve shut down the schools and the government has issued an order saying that people who harbor people with Ebola and dont bring them for medical treatment will face criminal charges A lot of people early on didnt necessarily accept that this was some new disease They figured it was malaria or  or something like that Thats part of what has led to some of the resistance and misunderstanding  people not knowing that this virus is different People have been told not to shake hands But this is West Africa People usually grab your hand in both their hands and dont let go especially someone who really wants to engage with you Its very hard for people not to shake hands You go into an office and people have their hands in their pockets just to keep from pulling them out and shaking hands As much as you know scientifically about how its spread and what you have to do to come in contact with it it is still quite scary to know there is a virus floating around thats got a better than  percent chance of killing you Just driving through the forest I was thinking that somewhere out there theres some   that has this virus coursing through its body waiting to jump into humans No one has proven definitively that thats the source of the virus but it seems like its that So its a little ominous to look into that jungle and think about that
