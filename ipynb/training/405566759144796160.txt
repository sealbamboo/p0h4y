This week marks the start of the annual eattoomuch and movetoolittle holiday season with its attendant declining health and surging regrets But a welltimed new study suggests that a daily bout of exercise should erase or lessen many of the injurious effects even if you otherwise lounge all day on the couch and load up on pie To undertake this valuable experiment which was   scientists at the University of Bath in England rounded up a group of  healthy young men All exercised regularly None were obese Baseline health assessments including biopsies of fat tissue confirmed that each had normal metabolisms and blood sugar control with no symptoms of incipient diabetes  The scientists then asked their volunteers to impair their laudable health by doing a lot of sitting and gorging themselves  Energy surplus is the technical name for those occasions when people consume more energy in the form of calories than they burn If unchecked energy surplus contributes as we all know to a variety of poor health outcomes including insulin resistance  often the first step toward diabetes  and other metabolic problems   Overeating and inactivity can each on its own produce an energy surplus Together their ill effects are exacerbated often in a very short period of time Earlier studies have found that even a few days of inactivity and overeating spark detrimental changes in previously healthy bodies   Some of these experiments have also concluded that exercise blunts the ill effects of these behaviors in large part it has been assumed by reducing the energy surplus It burns some of the excess calories But a few scientists have suspected that exercise might do more it might have physiological effects that extend beyond just incinerating surplus energy  To test that possibility of course it would be necessary to maintain an energy surplus even with exercise So that is what the University of Bath researchers decided to do  Their method was simple They randomly divided their volunteers into two groups one of which was assigned to run every day at a moderately intense pace on a treadmill for  minutes The other group did not exercise  Meanwhile the men in both groups were told to generally stop moving so much decreasing the number of steps that they took each day from more than  on average to fewer than  as gauged by pedometers The exercising groups treadmill workouts were not included in their step counts Except when they were running they were as inactive as the other group Both groups also were directed to start substantially overeating The group that was not exercising increased their daily caloric intake by  percent compared with what it had been before while the exercising group consumed almost  percent more calories than previously with the additional  percent replacing the energy burned during training  Over all the two groups net daily energy surplus was the same  The experiment continued for seven days Then both groups returned to the lab for additional testing including new insulin measurements and another biopsy of fat tissue  The results were striking After only a week the young men who had not exercised displayed a significant and unhealthy decline in their blood sugar control and equally worrying their biopsied fat cells seemed to have developed a malicious streak Those cells examined using sophisticated genetic testing techniques were now overexpressing various genes that may contribute to unhealthy metabolic changes and underexpressing other genes potentially important for a wellfunctioning metabolism  But the volunteers who had exercised once a day despite comparable energy surpluses were not similarly afflicted Their blood sugar control remained robust and their fat cells exhibited far fewer of the potentially undesirable alterations in gene expression than among the sedentary men  Exercise seemed to completely cancel out many of the changes induced by overfeeding and reduced activity said Dylan Thompson a professor of health sciences at the University of Bath and senior author of the study And where it did not countermand the impacts he continued it softened them leaving the exercise group better off than the nonexercise group despite engaging in equivalently insalubrious behavior  From a scientific standpoint this finding intimates that the metabolic effects of overeating and inactivity are multifaceted Dr Thompson said with an energy surplus sparking genetic as well as other physiological changes But just how exercise countermands those effects is impossible to say based on the new experiment he added Differences in how each groups metabolism utilized fats and carbohydrates could play a role he said as could the release of certain molecules from exercising muscles which only occurred among the men who ran  Of more pressing interest though is the studys practical message that if you are facing a period of overconsumption and inactivity  also known as the holidays  a daily bout of exercise will prevent many of the negative changes at least in the short term Dr Thompson said Of course his study involved young fit men and a relatively prolonged period of exercise But the findings likely apply he said to other groups like older adults and women and perhaps to lesser amounts of training Thats a possibility worth embracing as the pie servings accumulate
