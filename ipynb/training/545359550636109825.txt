For the first time in two decades a new treatment has been shown to limit damage from a common type of stroke   that mechanically removing a clot in addition to using a standard clotbusting medicine lowered the risk that a stroke sufferer would be seriously disabled Most strokes are caused by a clot in a blood vessel supplying the brain The usual treatment is a clotdissolving medicine called tPA but it must be given within four and a half hours after symptoms start Several devices that can be pushed through blood vessels to mechanically remove the clot have come on the market since  But three studies published last year in the   did not find a benefit The new study tested more modern versions of these devices The study involved  stroke patients About  percent were given the clotbusting medicine and half also were treated with a clotremoving device They were treated within six hours of the start of their symptoms Three months later  percent of those given both treatments could live independently and take care of themselves versus  percent of those given tPA alone The death rate was similar  about  percent at one month Results were published online Wednesday by the New England Journal
