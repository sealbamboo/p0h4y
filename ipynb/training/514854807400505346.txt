Any research institution that receives federal funding will soon have to screen certain kinds of scientific experiments to see if the work could potentially be misused to endanger the public The new policy will take effect next year and its the latest effort by the U S government to come to grips with so called dualuse biological researchlegitimate medical or public health studies that could reveal how to make alreadyworrisome germs or toxins even more destructive Only a small number of experiments are expected to raise this type of concern one official said a recent review of alreadyfunded research found only a handful of projects But some of this research including a labaltered bird flu virus has proven hugely contentious with scientists   on whether it should even be done Research institutions have long had biosafety review boards charged with making sure that infectious agents and toxins will stay safely contained within labs The new   means that universities and other federallyfunded science organizations will have to consider whether certain kinds of experiments might generate knowledge that could provide a recipe for a weapon or attack The required review covers work that involves a list of  nasty toxins and pathogens such as Ebola and anthrax and seven categories of sensitive experiments that scientists sometimes call the Seven Deadly Sins These include studies that could make a germ more deadly or contagious or that would let it evade existing treatments or diagnostic tests The new policy for research institutions is similar to   issued in March of  that requires government funding agencies like the National Institutes of Health NIH to screen proposed research projects for potential dualuse dangers before issuing grants Its a complementary process says Amy Patterson associate director for biosecurity and biosafety policy at the NIH I think it is important for institutions and investigators to also gain expertise in the mindset As a project is underway she adds They are going to have to be mindful as well of whether dualuse issues emerge during the conduct of the science All of this regulatory action came in the wake of   over two experiments that made a kind of highlypathogenic bird flu more contagious in ferrets the lab standin for humans Critics said that the researchers had created superflus that could cause a pandemic in people if they ever fell into the wrong hands or got out of the lab The government put a special review process in place for this type of flu research but scientists   about the wisdom of conducting research intended to give pathogens new properties sometimes called gainoffunction work The U S governments approach to gainoffunction studies is definitely an area that we are actively discussing says Andrew Hebbeler assistant director for biological and chemical threats at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy He says officials want advice on gainoffunction studies from a government advisory committee called the   That committee reviewed the controversial bird flu experiments back in  and  But the government has not convened this advisory group for almost two years Federal officials recently appointed a slew of new members and have scheduled a meeting for next month One of the agenda items will include thinking through risks and benefits associated with gainoffunction studies says Hebbeler As these discussions advance within the government we hope to have more to share with you in the future The National Academies of Sciences is also planning to wade into the debate soon with a symposium that could be held later this year
