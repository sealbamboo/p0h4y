The latest study published in the journal Arthritis  Rheumatism shows that those substances may also battle   which is at the root of   a painful degenerative joint disease in which cartilage that normally protects joints starts to wear away under the influence of the inflammatory factors  For the estimated  million people affected by arthritis in the United States these results are certainly welcome news Starting with studies in mice the researchers found that animals that ate a diet high in the sulforaphane found in broccoli had significantly less cartilage damage and signs of osteoarthritis compared to mice who did not consume sulforaphane The team then moved to human and cow cartilage cells and found that the sulforaphane was equally effective in protecting these cells from damage  The sulfurbased compound they say may be blocking enzymes that contribute to inflammation in cartilage and the scientists are starting a trial to see if broccoli can protect a small group of arthritis patients getting knee replacement surgery If that trial confirms these early results that could help more people to avoid arthritis to begin with although surgery can treat symptoms protecting joints from irreversible damage would keep joints stronger for a longer period of time Although surgery is very successful it is not really an answer Once you have osteoarthritis being able to slow its progress and the progression to surgery is really important study author Ian Clark professor of musculoskeletal biology at the University of East Anglia said in a statement Prevention would be preferable and changes to lifestyle like diet may be the only way to do that Not to mention that a broccolirich diet could lower risk of other chronic diseases like obesity which prior studies   arthritis
