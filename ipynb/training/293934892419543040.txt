 — Weight loss takes a lot of personal accountability — you have to make yourself exercise, watch what you eat, and limit your portions. But according to a new survey of 3,000 UK women, women constantly overstate how responsible they are — about 474 times a year, or 9 times per week.. In a survey conducted by Timex, (who’s releasing a new body-monitoring device for dieters) women fessed up to lying to themselves and others more than once a day about their less-than-perfect eating habits.. The single most popular lie? “It was only a small portion.”. The foods that spurred women to lie the most included desserts, cheese, bread, fries and burgers, wine, and beer, the survey found. Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed said they try their best to eat well, but admitted to slipping up occasionally. More than 40 percent lied to others about their healthy habits, simply to give off the impression that they are healthier than they really are.. Here, the top 10 lies women tell about their diets:. 1. It was only a small portion.. 2. I’ll have a big lunch, so I won’t eat much after this.. 3. I treat myself only once in a while.. 4. I always eat my five fruits and vegetables a day.. 5. I didn’t touch any of the biscuits.. 6. I had only one glass.. 7. I didn’t eat the last one.. 8. I won’t eat again today after this.. 9. I was too busy to have lunch.. 10. I might as well polish them off now, or they’ll go bad.. If you’ve told one (or more) of these lies today, try these no-fail ways to stay accountable:
