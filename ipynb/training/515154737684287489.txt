Dieters often say Hold the dressing but hold on That might make those virtuous vegetables less nutritious a study shows Researchers at Purdue University found that some fat matters  and that the kind of fat matters too For the study  people ate salads topped with dressings that had varying fats saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated Each salad was served with  grams  grams or  grams of fat from dressing The researchers tested the diners blood to learn how well they absorbed compounds such as lycopene and betacarotene which are associated with a reduced risk of problems such as cancer and heart disease Monounsaturated fats are found in canola and olive oils Saturated fats are found in butter and cream Polyunsaturated fats are found in corn and soybean oils Fatphobes take note The researchers found that people needed the least of the dressings made with monounsatured fat to get the most absorption If you want to utilize more from your fruits and vegetables you have to pair them correctly with fatbased dressings  the studys lead author and a Purdue associate professor of food science said in a statement If you have a salad with a fatfree dressing there is a reduction in calories but you lose some of the benefits of the vegetables The study was published online Wednesday in the journal Molecular Nutrition  Food Research  Researchers found that soybean oil was the most dependent on how much was eaten The more fat the more carotenoids the subjects absorbed Saturated fat  butter in this case butter  also depended on volume but less so Olive oil lovers are in luck Monounsaturated fatrich dressings promoted the equivalent carotenoid absorption at  grams of fat as it did  grams You can absorb significant amounts of carotenoids with saturated or polyunsaturated fats at low levels but you would see more carotenoid absorption as you increase the amounts of those fats on a salad Ferruzzi said The findings build on a  Iowa State University study that showed better carotenoid absorption from fullfat dressings when compared with lowfat or fatfree dressings
