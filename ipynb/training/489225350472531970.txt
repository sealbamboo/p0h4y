The nations fourth leading cause of death is getting a little less common and a bit less deadly And while racial disparities remain there is equal progress in driving down stroke incidence and improving survival among African Americans and white Americans a new study finds Between  and  rates of stroke among a representative sample of Americans who were between  and  years old upon recruitment declined steadily A stroke victims likelihood of dying also decreased during the period The decline in stroke incidence was largely driven by lower rates of stroke among those over  as there was no drop in strokes among younger patients But the improved survival rates were driven by a declining death rate among younger stroke victimsthose under  Among stroke victims older than  there was little improvement in the likelihood of dying within  days or a year of suffering a stroke In explaining the drop the authors of theÂ latest study on stroke in America published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn cited better and more widespread control of risk factors for stroke including smoking high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes and atrial fibrillation Over time the researchers documented a growth in the proportion of participants taking medications to control hypertension and worrisome cholesterol levels and a decrease in smoking Better stroke treatmentand specifically the institution of specialized stroke centers in US hospitalswas also credited with improving survival rates But in an editorial published alongside the new research a pair of neurologists from the University of Miamis Miller School of Medicine cautioned that in the years ahead the trend could well be reversed by an aging generation in which obesity poor nutrition and sedentary behavior are widespread The absence of declining stroke rates among the current studys younger cohort could be an early warning sign of that wrote Drs Ralph L Sacco and Chuanhui Dong Unless health disparities are address and innovative strategies to change behavior are developed and adopted the cerebrovascular health of the population will be unlikely to improve the two wrote In the group of  participants who were followed by study authors for nearly  years suffered a stroke Most of those strokesinvolved an interruption of blood flow to the brain an ischemic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke in which the patient has widespread bleeding in the brain accounted for  of those strokes Eighteen patients suffered both types of stroke during the study period Each year an estimated  Americans suffer a stroke and by the year   of the adult population is expected to have had a stroke leading to death or disability and an annual national medical bill of  billion
