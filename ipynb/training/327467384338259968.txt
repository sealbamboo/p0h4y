
 You might think that everyone with a recent leukemia diagnosis appears ill but that isnt true Some go to their primary care doctor with vague complaints of feeling tired or of having a cold and a few hours after having their blood drawn are stunned to receive a phone call that they must get to the hospital immediately Some get stuck in the   of denial refusing to believe they have leukemia even after theyve received chemotherapy for it or in the bargaining stage negotiating for just one more bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis Others look like my new patient His hemoglobin is  my leukemia fellow told me A normal hemoglobin for a man should be closer to  When we drew his blood it came out almost clear How many bags of blood are you going to give him I asked She hesitated Hes refusing any blood product transfusions Hes a Jehovahs Witness The Jehovahs Witnesses are a religious group that believe among other things that only a minority of people reach heaven They also believe that it is wrong to receive the tissue of another human being and that doing so violates Gods law even if it is potentially lifesaving This presented quite an ethical quandary To treat our patients cancer adequately we would need to give him chemotherapy at doses high enough to obliterate his entire bone marrow at least for a while During this time he would not be able to manufacture his own red blood cells or platelets so we would have to support him with transfusions  sometimes as frequently as daily Supportive measures like blood product transfusions and antibiotics have led to a marked drop in mortality from the actual leukemia treatment over the past half century to less than  percent Without such supportive measures death is almost guaranteed Without chemotherapy though death is certain at the hands of the leukemia itself My fellow and I walked into our patients room to talk with him He was lying in bed and surrounded by his relatives who were sitting in chairs or on his bed He smiled weakly at us pale but handsome We introduced ourselves to everyone and then started talking about how to treat his leukemia So you understand that the therapy we recommend has the potential to cure you but it is unlikely youll be able to survive the chemotherapy without receiving blood transfusions I summarized I understand he said But if we dont treat your leukemia you will die from it I looked him in the eyes at the crowsfeet that told me he had laughed a lot of times in his life and down to his hands holding those of his niece sitting by his side Tears were streaming down her cheeks I know  I heard that youre a Jehovahs Witness I come from a different background  Im Jewish Well nobodys perfect his brother piped up Everyone laughed easing the tension in the room I have different beliefs from you so I cant say I totally understand where youre coming from but I respect your faith and well follow your lead on what you want to do I told the patient Youre the boss  No hes the boss he said pointing toward the ceiling and beyond Others in the room nodded in agreement  He declined transfusions but he did want to receive chemotherapy so we compromised on a lowerdose treatment and minimized our lab draws to one per week to preserve what blood he had After two weeks his hemoglobin dropped to  after three weeks it fell to  One month into his hospitalization he became too dizzy to stand and his heart starved for the oxygen his missing red blood cells would have carried just stopped beating He went into cardiac arrest and died The staff on the leukemia floor took his death hard all plagued by the same question Had we done enough for him  We enter our chosen profession to kill that malignant golem leukemia But our patient approached his leukemia focusing more on eternity than his time on earth While many felt his belief had tied our hands so that we couldnt treat his leukemia optimally ultimately our responsibility must be to our patients goals more than to our own in this case his relationship to God and his desire to reach heaven I hope he made it
