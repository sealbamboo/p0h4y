An inexpensive antifungal pill thats already on the market may help treat a very common type of skin cancer researchers reported Monday Patients with   who took the pills for between a month and  weeks saw their tumors shrink by about  percent a team at Stanford University in California reported  It was a small group and very short experiment but their findings build on other studies suggesting that itraconazole can help shrink a range of tumors including lung and prostate tumors The experiment confirmed that the drug works by interfering with a process that cancer cells use to develop called the hedgehog pathway the researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Other studies have shown the drug can have a second role in stopping the process called angiogenesis that cancer cells use to grow blood vessels to feed themselves Dr Jean Tang an associate professor of dermatology at Stanford and colleagues and students tested  patients with basal cell carcinoma which is diagnosed in  million people a year In patients given two itraconazole pills a day for a month and in patients given a lower dose for  weeks tumors shrank by nearly a quarter they reported More testing will clearly be needed but the benefits of a cheap and welltested drug are obvious Tang said New drugs cost about  million and an average of  years to develop Tang said We are shortcutting the process by using a drug thats already been around for  years and given to tens of thousands of people Side effects of the drug are usually mild but can in rare cases be serious They include liver and heart failure Basal cell carcinoma is a very slow growing tumor and in most cases cutting away the lesion cures the patient But in very rare cases it can spread and then patients need drug treatment too
