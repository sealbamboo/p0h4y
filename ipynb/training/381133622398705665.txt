For decades doctors have been recommending that children with scoliosis wear a back brace so that the sideways curve of the spine doesnt get worse But there was scant evidence to prove back braces really help And telling a teenage girl shes going to have to wear a brace  hours a day for   years as pro golfer   did can be a tough sell for parent and child alike To avoid the brace doctors have tried lots of other things  exercise avoiding exercise traction and electrical stimulation  but none of them have seemed to help The brace prevailed as the best way to avoid surgery But were the doctors right To find out if a medical treatment works researchers turn to   to test one approach against an alternative usually a sham treatment or placebo But theres no easy placebo for a back brace and researchers figured that many parents wouldnt want to leave their childs treatment choice up to chance This is a childs spine were talking about If not treated effectively   can lead to permanent deformity disc damage and neurological damage So researchers looking to answer the question about braces effectiveness had a tough challenge They screened  patients at  sites in the United States and Canada to find  families willing to participate in a randomized trial Ultimately the scientists enrolled another  children by letting their families decide whether to brace or not Then theres the matter of getting a teenager most often a girl to wear a back brace  hours a day The researchers put temperature sensors in the braces so they could tell if they were actually being worn Almost onethird of the patients quit wearing the brace altogether and only a few wore it for the recommended  hours a day The results were just   in the   It turned out that the more hours a day a child wore a brace the less the spine curvature got worse  hours a day or more worked best Altogether about threequarters of the children who wore a brace avoided a spine curvature of  degrees or more compared with about half those in the control group But that means half of the children who got no treatment turned out fine as did  percent of the patients who didnt wear the brace much That the authors conclude may mean that the criteria for bracing may be too broad resulting in unnecessary treatment for many patients Or as an accompanying editorial put it finding out that so many children with scoliosis did well without bracing is important too The challenge for the field going forward is to identify children who are most likely to benefit from bracing and those who are unlikely to benefit the editorial said Stacy Lewis ended up having back surgery for scoliosis despite those long years in a brace Her surgeons modified the procedure to reduce the side effects that could hurt the young golfers prospects They seemed to have made the right choice Lewis is now   in the world for womens golf Fortunately most children will never have to face the brace Only about  percent of children are diagnosed with scoliosis and less than  percent end up needing treatment
