Vroom Vroom Ow When it comes to toys that cause serious injuries those little scooters kids push along with one foot are unique A look at trends in injuries that sent kids to the emergency room over more than  years shows an Everestlike mountain of problems with rideon toys including scooters that reached its zenith in   an estimated  injuries Ive never seen a spike like this for any other product says   a pediatric emergency physician and director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio Smith and his colleagues just published an analysis of toyrelated injuries drawn from Consumer Product Safety Commission data spanning more than two decades They found that the rate of toyrelated injuries increased by  percent from about  per  kids in  to  per  kids in  The chart stops at  because of coding changes that affected the categories though not the overall numbers He says the analysis is clearly an underestimate of the problem because it doesnt include figures for urgent care centers doctors offices and the kids who got hurt but didnt seek care The   in the journal  Footpowered scooters accounted for  percent of the toyrelated hospital admissions over  years Smith says Most of the injuries are related to falls What kinds of problems did the kids have Fractures and brain injuries are the types that are most likely to lead to hospitalization he says Smith says the data cant prove cause and effect but the faddish popularity of collapsible lightweight scooters is the logical explanation for the bump in injuries After  the number of injuries declined some which Smith says could be to a cooling of interest in the scooters and greater attention to safety But Smith says scooterrelated injuries started to pick up again in  so it would make sense to remind parents and their kids to take care Kids should wear helmets when theyre on wheeled toys on a hard surface Smith says Also keep kids on scooters away from traffic Collisions with cars lead to the most serious injuries
