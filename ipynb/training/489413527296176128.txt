NPRs Jason Beaubien is in   Sierra Leone covering the Ebola outbreak that began in March in Guinea and has spread to neighboring countries This morning he talked with us about a controversial burial the impact of the no touching recommendation  and a sign of hope The funeral definitely captured the tension over Ebola The son of this woman had dug a grave right behind her house in the backyard where she wanted to be buried But other people filled the grave in before her body arrived because they didnt want her buried there Eventually the local chief came to settle everything and the chief was quite upset The son had to apologize to the chief for not having consulted him about burying his mother in the backyard Then the chief allowed him to bury his mother in the village but it had to be in the jungle behind the village And so this guy and some relatives within an hour had cleared this area and dug a grave six feet deep Thats where they had the burial The chief said this was the last time he was going to allow someone to bury an Ebola victim in the village By the Ebola treatment center on the periphery of Kailahun three or four miles from her village People just dont know how Ebola spreads And they worry if a bodys been buried and has Ebola in it the Ebola will be able to get out and get them When a person dies the virus has run rampant through that person The level of virus is much lower in a person whos built up antibodies to fight it back A dead body is incredibly hot from Ebola and is likely to transmit the virus This morning I heard there was a dead body a man just behind his house People said hed been sick for quite some time like three years So its unclear whether he actually died from Ebola or something else But when someone is just found dead in the street everybody thinks its Ebola and you have to treat the body as if its Ebola Everyone was terrified Guys suited up in protective suits three layers of gloves WHO World Health Organization is trying to train local guys to do this And this is part of the story at the moment Youve got Ebola cases popping up all over not just in Sierra Leone but in Liberia in Guinea Somebody has to go in and deal with the bodies The problem throughout the region is that there isnt the medical staff trained in how to deal with an Ebola case Well just a few minutes ago I was talking to this one guy He was saying that initially they believed that the white people who were showing up to treat Ebola were cannibals and they were trying to steal body parts They were taking blood samples taking swabs from dead bodies And he said they believed   was a cannibal He said it directly to me But he said now he knows that thats not the case He said the people are gaining confidence in the people whove come to try to treat people here This man was talking about precautions people are taking He was saying that the no touching recommendation is being applied to sex That no one in the village was having sex Im not sure thats necessarily true but he said that was how the order on no touching was being interpreted That is a message that has been given out in general NGOs nongovernmental organizations are putting out material about how Ebola spreads what to do to keep yourself safe No touching is one of the recommendations Basically its just said that youre not to touch other people and everybody is interpreting that however they wish So in church theyre no longer shaking hands Id assumed people in their families are still touching each other but the no sex thing is how that guys interpreting it In many ways its depressing Schools are shut the sole bank in town is shut things are fairly bleak One guy was telling me hes taking this time to go out to work on his garden to get the weeds out Thats how he was dealing with it A fair number of people are just standing around even though groups have been banned Last night five patients who were confirmed positive for Ebola were released from the treatment center the largest group ever to walk out of there They were quite excited at   It shows that despite these incredibly high new numbers of cases and deaths some people are recovering and are completely cured and being sent home
