It is proposed to form a diabetic association open ultimately to all diabetics rich or poor for mutual aid or assistance and to promote the study the diffusion of knowledge and the proper treatment of diabetes in this country So wrote HG Wells in a letter to the Times  years ago in   The author famed for being an early pioneer of sciencefiction writing also had a strong interest in helping people with diabetes  because he was one of them A year before another letter from him had appeared in the newspaper appealing for funds to support the diabetes clinic at Kings College Hospital in London Its success led the renowned thinker to believe people were willing to support a more adventurous enterprise Something psychologically and socially valuable had been discovered the latent solidarity of people subject to a distinctive disorder he wrote in  More prosperous people with diabetes were to be approached to pay  to become members of the Diabetes Association which would then work for everyone with the condition HG Wells wrote more than  books including the sciencefiction tales The Island of Dr Moreau The Invisible Man and The Time Machine But it was his doctor Robert Daniel RD Lawrence who persuaded him to lead the campaign to raise funds for diabetes Dr Lawrences clinic at Kings College Hospital in London had become cramped and outdated so in  he asked some of his more affluent patients for contributions Wells initially gave just s d to fund the association pleading poverty But when Lawrence complained Wells wrote his first letter to the Times  appealing for others to contribute funds  and got the funding needed for new and improved facilities Dr Lawrence had been diagnosed with type  diabetes in  when there was no effective treatment and the condition was fatal He moved to Italy expecting to live out his last few years there But in early  he received a telegram from a colleague at Kings Hospital London that said Insulin it works Come quick His biographer and daughterinlaw Jane Lawrence tells how by that point he was dwindling away but he made it back across Europe and received his first dose of insulin in May of that year RD Lawrence went on to become a leading figure in forging understanding of diabetes as a condition and  fighting for those with it be able to live normal lives His writings helped define how diabetes was viewed for decades His book The Diabetic Life was first published in  ran to  editions and was published in many languages A practical guide to living with diabetes The Diabetic ABC was published in  Forming the Diabetic Association was part of that Dr Lawrence was elected chairman  a position he held until   while HG Wells became president Jane Lawrence says This was the first patientcentred association in the world It was so unusual in those days where the doctor was god Not long before this type  diabetes had been a death sentence People with the condition needed insulin  and it was only used in humans in  Even in the s people would only have had access to insulin if they could afford it and life would not have been pleasant even for them  They would have had to use large thick needles to administer insulin which was from animals and not fully purified and so there was a high risk of allergic reactions Today most insulin is made in laboratories  The needles they used would have needed to be washed and sterilised every day  as well as sharpened regularly They were given a fixed amount of insulin  so would have to eat the right amount of food to counteract this whether or not this left them feeling too full or still hungry  And their diet had to be around  fat One of the associations first campaigns was for free access to insulin well before the formation of the NHS The organisation became the British Diabetic Association in  and Diabetes UK in  It is now a charity with an annual income of m with  supporters across the UK There are m people diagnosed with the condition and an estimated  who have diabetes but dont know it Around  have type  which usually develops over the age of  when people produce too little insulin  or the insulin produced fails to work properly Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor Barbara Young Diabetes UKs current chief executive said All of us who work at Diabetes UK are immensely proud of our heritage as it is hugely inspiring to follow in the footsteps of an author of the stature of HG Wells and an eminent physician like RD Lawrence Diabetes UKs work during the  years since Wells wrote his letter to the Times is one of the reasons why life for people with diabetes today is much better  than it was in  Wells was also prescient in seeing how the patientgroup model might expand In yet another prediction of the future he envisaged the plethora of health groups we have now writing The experiment  might not end with diabetics
