Is your banker honest Not if you remind him of where he works a new study suggests Employees of an international bank were more inclined to lie for financial gain if they were thinking about their jobs than if they were thinking about their home life according to a study published online Wednesday in the journal  The conclusions imply that cheating propensity is embedded in the business culture of the banking industry and not in the type of person who goes into banking These are not generally dishonest people said University of Chicago behavioral economist Alain Cohn lead author of the study What our results suggest is that current norms in the banking industry tend to favor dishonesty and that the banks should initiate a change in norms Researchers have demonstrated that the written and unwritten rules of ethics tend to vary with peoples multiple identities such as worker parent student consumer taxpayer Cohn and his colleagues from the University of Zurich wanted to see whether bankers prompted with their work identity would be less honest than those prompted with their athome identity They enlisted  employees of an international bank they promised to keep its name secret to play a simple coinflipping game Those randomly assigned to one group answered questions unrelated to their profession while others answered questions about their professional background at the bank Then they flipped a coin  times without anyone watching and reported the results The catch Each volunteer was told which outcome would pay out a  reward on each of the  trials They also were told they would collect only if their overall results were equal to or higher than those of a person from a random pilot study Despite the clear incentive for cheating participants who answered questions about their personal life reported results that were only slightly above chance  The primed volunteers however reported a much higher success rate  That researchers said isnt just dumb luck Its cheating The study was not designed to detect individual cheaters but researchers could calculate that slightly more than a quarter of the primed participants exaggerated their results Which department they worked in whether that department offered financial incentives and how important competition was to the participants didnt factor into the results the study found Nor did the participants assumptions of what their peers would do the study found What did seem to matter was how much they agreed with a statement that social status is primarily determined by financial success Hearty accord was associated with reporting more successful outcomes of the coin toss Those who were reminded of occupational roles most strongly endorsed this statement Cohn said And we also found that those who have a higher inclination toward materialism are more likely to cheat Still researchers were curious if the effect was isolated to the one anonymous bank or to banking at large which has been rocked by bigdollar scandals in the last decade They tested another  employees from a handful of other financial institutions They didnt behave significantly different than the ones from the large international bank said fellow author Ernst Fehr a behavioral economist at the University of Zurich And when they repeated the experiment with people from nonbanking jobs the difference between the primed and unprimed groups was insignificant That pointed researchers toward the banking culture This suggests that the social norms in the banking industry tend to be more lenient toward dishonest behavior and thus contribute to the reputational loss in the industry said coauthor Michel Andre Marechal also of the University of Zurich For an economic sector with a scarred reputation the results were a bit of good news mixed with bad In some sense its kind of optimistic because it says theyre just people like all of us said Duke University behavioral economist   who was not involved in the study In some sense its pessimistic because it says its the culture thats so corrosive That corrosion changed the way the bankers in the study saw themselves Ariely said Bankers do think of themselves as dishonest  not in a conscious way necessarily but in an unconscious way Because otherwise this priming would not work Researchers are hopeful that business culture can change Decades ago there were far fewer scandals and bankers enjoyed a reputation for honesty and scruples they noted Banks should remove financial incentives that might unintentionally promote unscrupulous behavior and adopt ethics training programs that are far more specific and detailed We are not arguing that you should remove all incentives we are arguing that maybe we should reduce the strength of this incentive Fehr said Cohn suggested drafting the finance equivalent of medicines   Requiring employees to sign their name before starting an ethically perilous task also may help  studies have shown that signing an insurance form before filling out details decreases false claims he noted Fehr warned that just writing tougher guidelines or strengthening monitoring both popular among politicians and corporate heads are unlikely to solve the problem Just pleading for integrity is not enough Fehr said You really have to exactly and precisely name the behaviors that you want to rule out and the behaviors that you deem desirable John Hall a spokesman for the American Bankers Assn said the bank that is the primary focus of the study is not representative of the whole industry Americas  banks set a very high bar when it comes to the honesty and integrity of their employees he said in an email Banks take the fiduciary responsibility they have for their customers very seriously Kirk Hanson executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University said the study demonstrated the influence of culture on behavior but it raised the question of how to define a bank The financial industry is so broad and made up of so many different kinds of institutions that to say that this is the banking culture makes one ask What is a bank Hanson said Banks changed in their character and became more and more separated from the consumer and real people and increasingly focused on monetary indicators alone over a period of time leading up to the early s And while participants earned personal rewards in the study Hanson said it is unclear whether these bankers would be driven by self interest or the interest of a larger group This does not indicate that these individuals are padding their own pockets necessarily Hanson said It indicates that they are part of a culture where the job is to use sharp business practices to increase your business units performance Those are some complexities that would be wonderful to explore
