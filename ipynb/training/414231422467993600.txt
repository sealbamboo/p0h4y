A tattooist in Baltimore has built up a huge customer base because of his unusual specialty   tattooing nipples on to women who have suffered from cancer and had their breasts removed  There is something very familiar about the suburbs of small towns across America  The roads are big and distances long but sooner or later you are guaranteed to come across a strip mall  a little open air shopping complex along the side of a main road And so there I was  minutes outside Baltimore parked outside one of these strip malls  This one had a hour pharmacy as well as a veterinary surgery a hairdressers a tanning shop and a tattoo parlour  Little Vinnies Tattoos to be precise and it was Little Vinnie I had come to meet He was a friendly man dressed in a tweed waistcoat a striped shirt and a smart felt hat Vinnie shook our hands welcomed us in and showed us around his business  The walls were covered in tattoo art with catalogues lined up at the back of the room packed with thousands of designs to choose from A classic heart with a dagger through the middle perhaps Or maybe your favourite cartoon character or  if you are feeling patriotic  you could choose from a bald eagle or the American flag A few customers were sitting on the benches waiting to go in one of the six studios along the side of the wall each with a black crushed velvet curtain for a door  But one studio on the other side of the room stood out It had more of a structure to it and a wooden door much like an office or a doctors surgery Rather appropriate really because although Vinnie has no medical training he has become a bit of a star in the medical world  He no longer spends his day tattooing anchors on mens biceps In fact most of his clients are women and they have one thing in common they are all recovering from breast cancer A few years ago a doctor in Baltimore asked Vinnie to help out with a patient who had had breast reconstruction leaving her with no nipples  So realistic were his skills in creating D nipple tattoos patients started demanding him over doctors who typically carry out basic tattoos as the final stage of reconstruction  Now he says it has taken over his life Vinnie sees up to  patients a year and travels across the country and beyond  To prove it there is a map in his studio with pins in it showing where people come from  he has clients in countries as far away as Saudi Arabia no mean feat in a part of the world where tattoos are considered   or forbidden When I was visiting Sarah had just finished her appointment and was beaming  Sarah is in her mids and last year was devastated to find out she had cancer  just a few months after being told she was pregnant  Within a month of giving birth to her son she had to have an operation to remove both her breasts She describes the first time she took off her bandages as the hardest day of her life  Every time you go and take a shower you see these scars that are a permanent reminder of what you just went through she says  But now she can smile I have other tattoos but I never thought I would be getting my nipples done It is certainly a conversation starter she jokes A selfconfessed bad boy who learned his trade while in the army Vinnie says there are a million people who need this done but just a handful of people doing it  He was even asked to fly to the United Arab Emirates recently because there were about  women who wanted his tattoos  but only three of their husbands would give them permission so he could not go Such is his reputation he is affectionately nicknamed the Michelangelo of nipple tattoos But Vinnie plays down his talents  he says his work is not artistically challenging In fact he got fed up a few years ago and decided to stop He said enough was enough and he wanted to get back to regular tattoos But then one day a woman called him up to ask for an appointment He said No and she sounded very upset  Then out of the blue his sister called telling him she had breast cancer too It was a sign he says that he had to continue with this work You lose the artistic satisfaction but then you gain this other satisfaction that is incredible he says I was not prepared for how it was going to make me feel Saturdays at  and some Thursdays at   or   Short editions MondayFriday  see World Service
