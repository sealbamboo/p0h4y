When it comes to mental illness there are plenty of stereotypes But in reality mood disorders can be hard to pinpointparticularly in people with   symptoms 
                   
                  Chalking it up to moodiness or trouble at work or tiredness is pretty common says Carrie Bearden PhD an associate professor in residence of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and psychology at the David Geffen School of Medical at UCLA The disorder varies in severity 
                   
                  Here are  signs that mood problems may be due to more than a quirky or difficult personality Bipolar disorder is characterized by upanddown episodes of mania and depression During a manic phase some patients can have a total break from reality 
                   
                  But   which is also a symptom of the disorder is a highenergy state in which a person feels exuberant but hasnt lost his or her grip on reality 
                   
                  Hypomania can be a pretty enjoyable state really Dr Bearden says A persons mood can be elevated they may have a lot of energy and creativity and they may experience euphoria This is the up side of bipolar disorder that some people with the condition actually enjoywhile it lasts Having a house full of halfcompleted projects is a hallmark of bipolar disorder People who can harness their energy when they are in a hypomanic phase can be really productive 
                   
                  Those who cant often go from task to task planning grand unrealistic projects that are never finished before moving on to something else 
                   
                  They can be quite distractible and may start a million things and never finish them says Don Malone MD the director of the Center for Behavioral Health and chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio A person who is in a bipolar depressive state is going to look just like someone who has regular depression They have the same problems with energy appetite sleep and focus as others who have plain old depression Dr Malone says 
                   
                  Unfortunately typical antidepressants alone dont work well in patients who are bipolar They can even make people cycle more frequently worsening their condition or send someone into a breakwithreality episode 
                   
                  Antidepressants can be downright dangerous in people with bipolar because they can send them into mania he says Some people with this condition suffer from mixed mania where they experience   of mania and depression at the same time During this state they are often extremely irritable 
                   
                  Everyone has bad days which is one reason this kind of bipolarity is much harder to recognize 
                   
                  We are all irritable or moody sometimes Dr Bearden says But in people with bipolar disorder it often becomes so severe that it interferes with their relationshipsespecially if the person is saying I dont know why Im so irritableI cant control it Some people are naturally talkative we all know a motormouth or Chatty Cathy But pressured speech is one of the most common symptoms of bipolar disorder 
                   
                  This kind of speech occurs when someone is really not in a twoway conversation Dr Bearden says The person will talk rapidly and if you try to speak they will likely just talk over you 
                   
                  They will also sometimes jump around to different topics Whats kind of a red flag is when it is atypical for the person to talk like this doing it only when they are in a manic cycle but not at other times she says People with this disorder often have difficulty in the workplace because so many of their symptoms can interfere with their ability to show up for work do their job and interact productively with others 
                   
                  In addition to having problems completing tasks they may have difficulty sleeping irritability and an inflated ego during a manic phase and depression at other times which causes excessive sleeping and additional mood problems 
                   
                  A lot of the workplace problems can be interpersonal ones Dr Malone says About  of people with bipolar disorder also have a substance abuse problem particularly alcohol use Dr Bearden says 
                   
                  Many people will drink when they are in a manic phase to slow themselves down and use alcohol to improve their mood when they are depressed When they are in a manic phase people with bipolar disorder can have an inflated selfesteem 
                   
                  They feel grandiose and dont consider consequences everything sounds good to them Dr Malone says 
                   
                  Two of the most common types of behavior that can result from this are spending sprees and unusual sexual behavior I have had a number of patients who have had affairs who never would have done that if they werent in a manic episodeduring this episode they exhibited behavior that is not consistent with what they would do normally he says People with this condition often have sleep problems During a depression phase they may sleep too much and feel tired all the time 
                   
                  During a manic phase they may not sleep enoughbut still never feel tired 
                   
                  Even with just a few hours of sleep each night they may feel great and have lots of energy 
                   
                  Dr Bearden says staying on a regular sleep schedule is one of the first things she recommends for bipolar patients This symptom may be something that is hard to recognize but it occurs frequently when someone is in a manic phase People feel like their mind is racing and that they cant control or slow down their thoughts 
                   
                  This flight of ideas sometimes occurs with pressured speech 
                   
                  People with bipolar may not recognize or admit that their mind is racing out of control says Dr Bearden
