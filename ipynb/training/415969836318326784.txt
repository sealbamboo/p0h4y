Texas has the   of uninsured people in the country with almost  in  people going without coverage One of them is Tammy Boudreaux Boudreaux  lives just outside of Houston and works as a freelance psychiatric social worker with no benefits She has been skipping mammograms and other checkups for years Its worrisome she says Its like gambling Gambling with my health and it is very frustrating The federal government has already extended the deadline for enrolling in health plans under the Affordable Care Act But even with HealthCaregov working better lately than it did in October and November its still unclear how many consumers will want the plans The government and insurers need uninsured people especially those who are healthy to sign up but many may decide its better for them to pay a penalty Boudreaux has logged on looked at the plans and remains largely unimpressed She figures she spent about  on medical care this year including a trip to the ER for a cut finger She also takes a few prescription drugs and occasionally sees a psychiatrist and a nutritionist She cant get insurance through her partner Laura Perez because her employer doesnt offer benefits to samesex couples Boudreaux was hoping to find a better deal on HealthCaregov She likes the monthly premiums that she sees but has balked at the high annual deductibles Lets say if I paid the  a month my deductible would be  she says I would have to pay up to  before I received any kind of payment from my insurance company Boudreaux could get a lower deductible if she paid a higher premium but about  a month is what she feels she can afford She doesnt qualify for subsidies to help pay for a policy I dont smoke Im relatively healthy So I was pretty insulted when I saw this she says I was extremely angry actually I felt hoodwinked by the insurance companies Oh heres this wonderful insurance plan but by the way you need to come up with  outofpocket first before we pay for anything  That reaction is typical says   an analyst focused on the new health insurance marketplaces for the consulting firm Avalere Health A lot of people arent ever going to get out of that deductible says Pearson Only if you have a catastrophic health event or youre really chronically ill will you ever hit your   People are left I think feeling like I spent a lot of money this year on the premium and I didnt get any meaningful coverage from my insurance  But Pearson says people forget two things if they just focus on the high deductible One is that the new plans must offer some free   such as mammograms and yearly physicals The other is that having a plan protects you from medical bankruptcy if you are in an accident or face something like a cancer diagnosis Thats because the Affordable Care Act requires that health plans have a yearly limit on outofpocket expenses If something serious did happen to Boudreaux she wouldnt pay more than  in the year Its a dilemma for Boudreaux who says she has considered the possibility that something catastrophic can happen That   a huge fear  what if she says But if nothing happens she thinks shed pay less just continuing to go along on her own And she could put the  that would go to the monthly premium into a savings account In any case Boudreaux doesnt feel any urgency to sign up right away Shes been uninsured for a few years so whats a month or two more And with the holidays coming up this is one difficult and confusing decision shed rather just avoid for now Whoa shut the computer she says Find something else to do Theres something much better I could be doing with my time than trying to figure out this rigmarole of insurance policies and deductibles and whats covered and whats preventative and whats included and blah blah blah Its not very well explained If Boudreaux doesnt enroll in a plan by the end of March her   would probably be a few hundred dollars  for the first year The penalty starts out at  or  percent of income in  and rises in later years
