A new public health campaign in England is urging families to make simple foods swaps such as switching to diet drinks.. People who sign up to the .  campaign will receive money-off vouchers towards their groceries. . Critics say this latest in a long line of government health drives puts the onus on consumers and not food manufacturers who should cut salt and sugar levels in their products. . A two-litre bottle of pop can contain the equivalent of 52 lumps of sugar.. Swapping sugary drinks to diet, sugar free options or milk could save a family up to three quarters of a 1kg bag of sugar over four weeks, according to the Change4Life Smart Swaps campaign. . Other swaps include:. Prof Kevin Fenton of Public Health England said: "Swapping like-for-like food in your diet could help you cut out surprising levels of saturated fat, sugar and ultimately calories.". Public Health England has set aside £840,000 worth of vouchers, provided by commercial food stores, for those who sign up to the campaign. . Malcolm Clark of the Children's Food Campaign says the government should be putting more pressure on food manufacturers. . "These good messages risk being undermined unless there is real change in what is sold and promoted to us in store.  The supermarkets should be the ones doing the swapping: permanently replacing promotions on unhealthy products with those for healthier items.. "There is nothing smart about Public Health England partnering with the food industry without expecting more in return."
