When I was in college my father David started walking with an odd barely perceptible limp He was in his mids a gregarious physician teacher and researcher who was always upbeat He told his four kids that he had a back problem  a deliberately vague cover story that I for one was willing to believe  I had never heard of the real culprit  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS In fact no one had ALS was a disease in the shadows During my fathers life it didnt even have its own advocacy organization This was the early s long before support groups and the Internet and a colored ribbon for every cause  And it was way before ice bucket challenges  My parents continued to use their code  back problem  to talk about the disease They used it to protect my younger sisters who were about to start high school but I think they were also protecting themselves My mother was also a physician and they both knew exactly what lay ahead Saying ALS out loud was too threatening But soon there was no getting around it My fathers legs were getting weaker his muscles were wasting and he started relying on a cane to get around I was  and my mother and I were out running errands one afternoon when she pulled the car over to the curb and stopped She told me the truth This was no slipped disc She laid it all out for me in black and white ALS is a progressive degenerative neurological disease that causes paralysis in the entire body Its fatal There is no cure  It sounded like something from a horror movie Over the next five years as my fathers health deteriorated he remained remarkably determined He ate a highprotein diet and swam laps every day in an attempt to maintain his muscle and fend off the atrophy caused by the disease He kept on swimming laps in our nextdoor neighbors pool even when he had to use a walker   and later a wheelchair  to get there He continued to work and direct research at his lab He was trying to develop a male contraceptive When his arms grew weak he worked at home dictating papers and memos opeds and letters He dictated an entire endocrinology textbook during that time My fathers remarkable intellect and photographic memory were intact He managed to stay in good spirits and always tried to encourage the rest of us Over time my fathers voice slowed down like a record on the wrong speed He couldnt swallow and had to eat through a feeding tube He suffered repeated bouts of pneumonia He was however still able to move his eyebrows Always the innovator he used his eyebrows to manipulate a switch on a visor that was hooked up to an early computer word program With each twitch of his brow he was able to slowly and laboriously write and compose notes to us  He could also still make jokes I remember one afternoon when he could only mouth the words in silence and we spent  minutes trying to figure out what he was trying to say Finally we realized it was And if you believe that I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you  There is something that happens in a community when one of its members develops an illness like this Some friends rise to the occasion and know intuitively what a family needs offering companionship and support without being intrusive  But others shy away They withdraw They dont know what to say so they dont say anything They make excuses and tell themselves that the family doesnt want company now or just wants to be alone They get so wrapped up in their own discomfort that they forget who is in really need of comforting It makes the pain of the illness that much worse I have to be honest The ice bucket craze made me cringe a bit at first It was jarring to watch people rap tap shiver and giggle about ALS of all things It seemed like a cheap stunt  Then I saw that patients were also getting into it The nice thing about the ice bucket challenge is that everyone could participate It didnt matter if they were in a wheelchair or had to rely on someone else to rub them down with a towel afterward  they were part of it  And the amount of money that has been raised by the     million as of lateSeptember  is staggering Finally This scourge is on the map front and center on the national consciousness But virtual awareness makes me uneasy I want this moment to last longer than a YouTube clip And with summer no longer here fewer people are going to want to pour ice over their heads ALS is a long hard slog like walking through quicksand The scientific process of searching for a cure is also a long haul with progress measured in baby steps The real challenge will be to keep this disease on the national agenda long after the ice has melted
