There are lots of theories about why food allergies asthma celiac disease and intestinal disorders like Crohns disease have been on the rise Dr Martin Blaser speculates that it may be connected to the overuse of antibiotics which has resulted in killing off strains of bacteria that typically live in the gut Blaser is an expert on the human microbiome which is the collection of bacteria viruses fungi and other microbes that live in and on the body In fact up to  percent of all the cells in the human body arent human at all  theyre microorganisms Blaser is the director of NYUs Human Microbiome Program and a former chairman of medicine there His new book is called   He tells  s Terry Gross that with the overuse of antibiotics as well as some other nowcommon practices like cesarean sections weve entered a danger zone  a no mans land between the world of our ancient microbiome and an uncharted modern world Since World War II weve seen big rises in a number of diseases asthma allergies food allergies wheat allergy juvenile diabetes obesity  These are all diseases that have gone up dramatically in the last  or  years One of the questions is Why are they going up Are they going up for  different reasons or perhaps there is one reason that is fueling all of them My theory is that the one reason is the changing microbiome that we evolved a certain stable situation with our microbiome and with the modern advances of modern life including modern medical practices we have been disrupting the microbiome And theres evidence for that especially early in life and its changing how our children develop We have experiments in mice where since were very interested in obesity if we put mice on a highfat diet they gain weight they get fat If we put them on antibiotics early in life they also get fat If we put them on both together they get very fat  Its clear that the effects of the antibiotics potentiate the effects of the highfat diet Were not letting the highfat diet off the hook were saying that theres another factor there  Theres a choreography theres a normal developmental cycle of the microbiome from birth over the first few years of life especially the first three years that appears to be the most important And thats how nature has how we have evolved together so that we can maximize health and create a new generation which is natures great purpose And because of modern practices we have disrupted that And then the question is Does that have consequences Our studies in mice show that it does have consequences Weve done epidemiologic studies in people that show that some of these modern practices are increasing the risk of obesity as well As far as we know when the baby is inside the womb it is apparently sterile  The big moment of truth is when the membranes rupture the water breaks and the baby starts coming out And thats where they first get exposed to the bacteria of the world and the first bacteria theyre exposed to is their mothers bacteria in the birth canal So as labor proceeds the babies are in contact with the microbes lining their mothers vagina and as theyre going out theyre covered by these bacteria They swallow the bacteria its on their skin  Thats their initial exposure to the world of bacteria Thats how mammals have been doing it for the last  million years whether theyre dolphins or elephants or humans  And we know a little about what those bacteria are The most common bacteria are lactobacillus and theres evidence that over the course of pregnancy the microbiome in the vagina changes just as many other parts of the body are changing The microbiome is changing in its composition in terms of maximizing lactobacilli and these are bacteria that eat lactose which is the main component of milk So the babys mouth is filled with lactobacilli The first thing that happens is they go up against their moms breast and they inoculate the nipple with lactobacilli and now milk and lactobacilli go into the new baby and thats the foundation for their microbiome and thats how they start their life  You could project that if they didnt acquire these organisms or they didnt acquire them normally or at the normal time then the foundations might be a little shaky Shortly after birth they compared the microbiomes in the babies that came out The babies that were born vaginally their microbiome not surprisingly looked like the moms vagina everywhere in the body  in their GI tract on their skin in their mouth But the babies born by Csection their microbiome looked like skin and it didnt even necessarily look like the moms skin maybe it was somebody else in the operating room So its clear that the microbiome is different immediately depending on the kind of birth There have been more and more epidemiologic studies asking the question really for the first time Are there longterm health consequences of being born by Csection Im concerned that the microbiome is part of our whole developmental process and if we disrupt it early there are potentially consequences  What I can tell you is that our immune system is quite complex There are many kinds of immune cells There are cells that strongly recognize foreign substances there are ones that try to damp the immune system and downregulate it Theres what we call innate immunity which is the immunity were all born with and then theres adaptive immunity  the immunity that develops when we experience different kinds of exposures So its very complex Its developing early in life Thats what sets in essence the immunological tone that will determine how allergic a person is or how stoical a person is in an immunologic sense There are many different probiotics If you go to the grocery store the health food store the drugstore there are shelves and shelves full of probiotics with different names different compositions I think I can say three things The first is that theyre almost completely unregulated second is that they seem to be generally safe and third is that theyre mostly untested  Right now its the Wild West Im actually a big believer in probiotics I think thats going to be part of the future of medicine that were going to understand the science of the microbiome well enough so that we can look at a sample from a child and say this child is lacking suchandsuch an organism and now were going to take it off the shelf and were going to give it back to that child  Just as today the kids are lining up for the vaccines in the future maybe the kids are going to be drinking certain organisms so that we can replace the ones that theyve lost
