 The socalled love hormone   promotes greater kindness in monkeys a new study finds It included two rhesus macaques who were seated next to each other and trained to choose different symbols that either provided a squirt of fruit juice for the monkey itself juice for the other monkey or no juice at all In repeated tests the monkeys had to make a choice between just two of the options juice for self or no juice juice to self or juice to other and juice to other or no juice After inhaling oxytocin the monkeys paid more attention to each other and were more likely to give the other monkey juice even if they didnt get juice themselves the Duke University researchers found Oxytocin is currently being evaluated as a therapy for   schizophrenia and other disorders characterized by a lack of interest or caring about others study leader Michael Platt a neuroscientist and director of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences noted in a Duke news release The hormone appears to boost   in patients but its not known how the process works or whether the effects are consistent over the long term This type of research may help establish monkeys as a good   and pharmacological model for understanding oxytocin therapy Platt said However scientists note that research involving animals often fails to produce similar results in humans
