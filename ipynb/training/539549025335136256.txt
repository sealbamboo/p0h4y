Before this season of overindulgence freights us with unwanted pounds or a gluttons guilt complex why not try the opposite of the holiday feast the fast Fasting need not be a punishing multiday ordeal of deprivation Increasingly scientists are warming to the intermittent fast which can be as brief as one skipped meal once or twice a week The benefits of fasting seem to extend far beyond managing weight A recent   in the  makes a cautious but encouraging case for how regularly cutting way back on calories for a short period of time may be good for your health The lead author is   a researcher at the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University As he and his coauthors write    consuming just  to  calories two days a week  or skipping breakfast andor lunch several days a week could boost the immune system sharpen the mind and fight off disease Keep in mind that the scientific evidence on this is still quite limited Scientists still dont know which diets that alter meal frequency or sharply restrict calories will work best for which people But the findings from the handful of human and animal studies exploring intermittent energy restriction seem to support one fundamental idea that exposing our cells to this mild stress results in adaptive changes that protect against more severe stress according to Mattsons paper which calls for more research in this area This makes sense since humans and other animals have fasted intermittently for much of our time on Earth As the paper notes The most common eating pattern in modern societies three meals plus snacks every day is abnormal from an evolutionary perspective Thousands of years ago we began fasting to express religious devotion and to this day all of the worlds major religions   at least once a year But fasting may seem extremely daunting if youve never attempted it The healthy among us have enough fat stored to survive on average for about  days without eating dont try this one at home But we get all kinds of signals from our bodies and the environment to eat at least twice a day And its those biochemical and psychological messages that we have to override if were going to disrupt that cycle of habitual eating however briefly Back in the spring when I did the   with two colleagues I fasted on four Sundays  skipping both lunch and dinner  so that I could test the effects of alcohol when combined with yeast and yogurt on an empty stomach While Id had moments of weakness when I doubted the endeavor and was seriously tempted to grab a snack in hindsight I found that I actually enjoyed forgoing food for most of a day I felt liberated lighter clearer of mind And I really appreciated food when I finally was allowed to eat again Lately Ive been pondering the secrets to successful fasting since a fast might be exactly what Ill want to do this month and next to counter holiday gluttony My first question How long and how to do it Well turns out that the answer depends on your objective If youre shooting high for big perks  antiaging immune system regeneration and diseasefighting  a minifast may not cut it according to   a gerontologist at the University of Southern California who studies the health benefits of fasting Longo argues that four to five days is the minimum amount of time you have to go with little to no food to see real changes and improvements in the immune system for one Anything less than that isnt a true fast he tells me But since thats impractical and potentially unsafe without the supervision of a doctor to do regularly Longo recommends skipping lunch instead I think skipping a meal  lunch or dinner  is probably the best thing that everybody can do I skip lunch because I love dinner and I want to be able to have pasta says the researcher whos from Italy Holding out for a big bowl of tagliatelle may be enough to keep Longo away from the cafeteria at noon but some of us may need another strategy One approach is the  diet which involves eating a lowcalorie around  calories diet of lean protein and very few carbs twice a week As my colleague Allison Aubrey   that approach is gaining traction in the UK and here in the US  a senior scientist and director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University offers a different view on practical fasting Roberts designed the   with hunger management as its principal objective She recommends a modified fast of  to  calories per day for one to two days a few times a year to people on the diet She says the fast can be useful for people whove learned how to curb cravings for cakes or doughnuts but who feel the temptation to gorge creeping back This is especially likely to happen around the holidays Roberts says when huge decadent meals have the potential to knock people back into their old ways If they go through the holidays eating garbage theyre going to get back some of the temptation for unhealthy food she says Doing a modified fast in January to zap away the cravings again can be helpful for some people And in the long run Roberts tells me she thinks one of the principal benefits of doing a modified fast a few times a year is that it can make you more insulinsensitive Someone who is more insulinsensitive wont have blood glucose swings which means theyll have a better ability to balance the amount of calories they take in and regulate their weight she says In other words being more insulinsensitive means being less hungry and less likely to overeat But to get there youll have to endure some hunger during a fast Roberts says Soldiering through it is essential to getting the benefit of insulin sensitivity So how do you get through those hunger pangs
