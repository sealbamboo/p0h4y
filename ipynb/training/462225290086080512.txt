If Valeant Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Michael Pearson succeeds in acquiring Allergan, he has promised to tee up a lot of cost-cutting. Already, he plans to dial back R&D spending and shed about 20 percent of the combined 28,000 employees who currently work for both drug makers.. At a recent luncheon with analysts, however, Pearson was pressed for further details on expenses he would slash if the Allergan deal comes to pass. According to analysts who attended, Pearson repeatedly pointed to Allergan’s golf course as an example.. But that’s not likely to happen. Why? Allergan, which is best known for the wrinkle fighter Botox, insists that it does not own a golf course.
