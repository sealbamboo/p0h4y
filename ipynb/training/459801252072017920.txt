Ron and Cornelia Suskind had just moved to Washington DC with their two young children when their yearold son Owen suddenly stopped speaking He went from saying I love you Lets get ice cream or Where are my ninja turtles to one word juice The Suskinds searched for answers as their once funloving and chatty son continued drifting farther away  no longer speaking or making eye contact His father a Pulitzer Prizewinning author and former Wall Street Journal reporter and his mother also a journalist searched relentlessly for answers After dozens of doctors appointments and meetings with specialists the Suskinds finally had a diagnosis autism Like many children with regressive autism Owen appeared to be developing like any child his age until he suddenly displayed symptoms Prior to his third birthday he lost his motor abilities language skills and the ability to sleep or eat Devastated by the diagnosis but determined to reconnect with their son the Suskinds began the long and painful process of trying to communicate with Owen His only comfort was watching Disney movies so the family became scholars of Disney The hours they spent watching animated characters light up the screen became their only family activity It would take years for them to discover that those movies and storylines were the key to ultimately rediscovering and reaching their son By the time Owen was about  years old his family realized he wasnt just mimicking the characters  but that he actually understood and related to their emotions By recognizing that and embracing his passion for Disney movies the Suskinds pulled Owen out of his shell They spoke to him in Disney voices incorporated the characters into his therapies and found parts of each movie that helped Owen understand what was going on in the world around him Now at age  Owen is attending a transitional college program in Massachusetts where he met his girlfriend who hes been dating for two years  chronicles the familys powerful journey into Owens world  and Owens return to theirs  in his new book  Researchers from MIT Yale and Cambridge are now examining Owens emotional and social development via beloved characters which has been dubbed affinity therapy They hope to find a systematic approach that may help others on the autism spectrum
