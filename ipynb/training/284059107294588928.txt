Katie Alonzo was stunned when doctors told her they couldnt get a drug her yearold daughter Abby was taking to fight lymphoma When a doctor says This is what you need to take And then all of a sudden somebody tells you Well that is what you need to take but this isnt available so were going to try this instead its very scary say Alonzo who lives in Port St Lucie Fla The company that sells the drug her daughter had been taking had run into    the kind of thing thats been causing lots of shortages Many drugs are made by only one company so when they have to halt production for some reason it quickly creates a shortage But doctors assured Alonzo that the cancer drug they were giving Abby instead would work just as well and Abby seemed to be doing OK This was just a stumbling block and we got over it Alonzo says And I was told that there was nothing wrong with taking this other medication Ill be fine And we did and we just kept on from there But privately Abbys doctors worried whether their fallback would be just as good And they knew hundreds of doctors around the country were making similar difficult choices to cope with drug shortages that have been plaguing the country for years Up until now there was speculation as to these drug shortages And doctors were worried about what this could mean to their patients But until now there was no evidence that it actually caused any harm says   one of Abbys physicians at St Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis Tenn So Metzger and her colleagues decided to study the lymphoma patients ages  to  who received the chemotherapy drug   instead of   while participating in a research project In this weeks issue of   they are   that their fears turned out to be true Those who got the other drug were significantly more likely to suffer a relapse The diseasefree survival rate was  percent for the  patients whose treatment included mechlorethamine In contrast it was  percent for the  patients who received cyclophosphamide Unfortunately we were the first ones to actually prove that Yes indeed there was harm done  Metzger says None of the patients died but they were forced to undergo another grueling round of chemotherapy more radiation and procedures to replace their bone marrow Its very toxic The chemotherapys incredibly intense Patients are at a lot of risk of serious complications Metzger says Those complications include infertility for boys lifethreatening infections and an increased risk of developing other cancers later in life because of the additional chemo One of the most frightening things about her case is that everyone assumed the substitute drug was just as good Metzger says This was quite a scary example that even where you think you have the best situation you cannot rely on that substitution she says Pediatric oncologist   at Stanford University School of Medicine who helped on the study says the extent of the problem is huge This is only the tip of the iceberg because this is only dealing with the anticancer drugs We have heard plenty of horror stories because of shortages of antibiotics and anesthetic drugs as well he says Unfortunately Abby Alonzo was among those patients who suffered a relapse and had to undergo the grueling followup treatment That was really horrible her mother says She was in the hospital and she was in isolation  It was real lonely It was really sad It was painful Abbys now  All the cancer and treatment damaged her lungs making it hard for her to play soccer But theres no sign of any cancer Her mom didnt even make the connection between the drug switch and her relapse until a couple of weeks ago when doctors told her what they discovered The idea that a child might relapse for no other reason except the unavailability of drugs that kids need in order to get rid of their cancer is just insane Alonzo says Federal officials have taken a number of steps to alleviate the shortages which are usually caused by manufacturing problems Companies are now required to alert the FDA when a shortage is coming so the agency can try to find alternative sources This year was the first in five years that a new record wasnt set for new drug shortages according to   of the University of Utah who tracks drug shortages The drug Abby needed just became available again but about  drugs remain scarce making it clear more needs to be done
