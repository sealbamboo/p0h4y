When reporter Tony Dokoupil was a teenager he found out that his father had sold marijuana but he just thought his parents were hippies A few years ago while working on a story about his fathers drug dealer past he discovered that actually in the s and s his father Anthony Dokoupil had been a bigtime marijuana smuggler He was arrested in the early s on a job selling  tons of marijuana Dokoupil tells   Terry Gross which was enough at the time to roll a joint for every college kid in the US Dokoupil is now writing a book about the controversial plant and is the author of the recent   cover story   about the group of entrepreneurs who are growing medical marijuana in Colorado and hoping to cash in on the plants recent legalization there for recreational use On Election Day Colorado and Washington became the first states to greenlight marijuana for recreational use which is big news for the expanding marijuana industry If legalization is here to stay Dokoupil says Colorados tightly regulated forprofit medical marijuana market will likely be the basis for the legalized recreational markets in other states as well In Colorado more than  million square feet of warehouse space outside of Denver are dedicated to growing marijuana and hundreds of dispensaries sell it To manage this growing business the state has plus pages of regulation to explain what is legal and isnt Marijuana grown in the state says Dokoupil is tracked from the time it blooms to final sale  every single ounce is accounted for After Eric Holder and the Obama administration suggested that they werent going to crack down on medical marijuana everybody and their brother grabbed a trash bag full of weed out of their backyard and were like All right medical marijuana here for sale  Then Colorado was really interesting  because theres a core of young educated politically connected and wellfinanced guys who said Whoa whoa whoa We cant have former black market drug dealers and bikini girls as the face of our industry because the communitys not going to accept it So they partnered with law enforcement They partnered with state legislators They hired incredibly highlevel political consultants and lobbyists who have worked nationally And they are the inside force that led to the creation of Colorados regulated medical marijuana industry which is unlike any in the country and which will be the basis for the legalized regulated market And so in response to the craziness that we saw in   a movement toward controlled regulated notinyourface nonconfrontational pot culture has begun So in Colorado the medical marijuana growers have to have hour video of their operations and that video is accessible by the state at any time  they can tap into it And they all have these badges and they had to go through background checks to get these badges So theres an attempt to keep black market money out of it  in Colorado youre unlikely to see a situation where a dispensary is in fact just a front for a Mexican cartel And then they had this additional rule which is pretty revolutionary  its called a  rule where  percent of all the marijuana that each store sells they have to grow themselves  That goes a long way to eliminating the introduction of black market weed  Stores arent just buying all their weed from Mexican cartels and marking it up  Thats a huge reason why the feds have focused on California California doesnt have tight regulations on who grows marijuana where it comes from So the feds move in and what they claim is that these med marijuana businesses are fronts for what are in fact just oldschool black market drug dealers And theyre not growing medical marijuana in small batches for patients Theyre growing it in Mexico or theyre growing it in the hills and theyre just bringing it in and it suddenly magically becomes legal once it gets in the store But in fact its based on illegality Colorado doesnt have that I hope that in the future there are tours of marijuana warehouses in the same way that there are tours of breweries today because its really incredible By law you have to grow indoors in Colorado And to do that these rooms are rigged with lights that mimic the effects of sunlight to grow the plant and different rooms have different seasons And theres a perpetual grow and different plants require different kinds of sunlight So you walk into these warehouses and at first you dont see anything because the actual plants are inside smaller rooms within rooms And all you hear is the buzz of electricity Its damp  you expect a forklift to come in from a side door And you get a little deeper in and you open one of these doors which are about the size of like Winnebagos where the actual plants are and your eyes just recognize Oh my god  its summer sunshine Its like you want lemonade And then you see a field of plants waving gently because theyre stirred by fans and there will be classical music playing or there will be hard rock depending on what the grower says the plant likes And then you go to another room and you open the door and it will have like a honeycoated light and youll be like Oh fall I want a pumpkin latte  how beautiful And there will be workers in there too And the workers are like the Keebler Elves of cannabis They live among the plants They sleep there Theyre caring for the plants constantly Theyre deeply devoutly about the plant and theyre usually shirtless or walking around barefoot Weve seen legalization in two states  thats the first step toward legalization in other states Thats a step toward legalization nationally So you have a third vice industry like tobacco and like alcohol The problem with that is that  percent of the profits tobacco companies and alcohol companies make comes from heavy users The business model is based on people consuming more than they should And so theres a strong economic incentive for big marijuana companies to create as much addiction as possible And yeah sure marijuana is less harmful than Jack Daniels but its not the same thing as safe or helpful in the home or helpful in the workplace or good And so the longterm worry is that you have sophisticated marketing programs in place distribution programs in place that create a double or tripling of the current level of marijuana usage And  by the way Americans already use marijuana at triple the global average So were talking about a tripling of a tripling and thats a big deal Its something to think about which is why many people are in favor of  or I believe will become more in favor of as they realize the risks  of severe limitations on the size of marijuana businesses and the advertising that they can undertake The people who were defying President Reagan and before that Nixon are not typical characters So the golden era of marijuana is considered to be the s and early s and the swashbuckling hero types who brought in marijuana at a time when the government was trying to crush marijuana culture  those people are not theyre just not normal people They dont have normal egos They dont have normal connections to substances themselves They see themselves as larger than life Theyre entitled to whatever comedowns they should want in exchange for the fantastic good theyve done flooding the market with good marijuana And by the way this is not them just saying that this is how theyre seen This is the way how people in the s and s saw marijuana smugglers  they saw them as heroes Theres a very very interesting article written by Timothy Leary the aciddropping Harvard professor called The Dope Dealer as Robin Hood and it makes the case that the folk hero of the s is the marijuana smuggler  as important as rock stars and underground artists And this was an influential article  it was reprinted in   And then even more recently when my article came out I had people write to me and say Oh your father is the Rosa Parks of legalization I was like Oh my God What
