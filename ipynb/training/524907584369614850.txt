Americans spend about  billion a year on weightloss supplements And the Food and Drug Administration spends a lot of effort policing distributors who market fraudulent products that are tainted with unsafe banned drugs But a study published Tuesday finds that buyers should beware Just because the FDA recalls a product for containing dangerous substances doesnt mean the product disappears from the market Researchers from the Cambridge Health Alliance a health care network affiliated with Harvard University got a list of  dietary supplements that the FDA recalled between  and  Then they analyzed  products including supplements marketed for weight loss sexual enhancement and sports performance enhancement that were still being sold months after being recalled They found that twothirds of the products still contained banned ingredients I was so disheartened to see that manufacturers would have the chutzpah to sell the exact same product even after it had been recalled says Harvards   a Cambridge Health Alliance researcher and internist His findings are published in the current issue of   the Journal of the American Medical Association Consider for example a weightloss product called Zi Xiu Tang Bee Pollen Capsule The FDA took action to recall the product in October  But when Cohen and his colleagues purchased the product in July  it still contained sibutramine  the banned drug that led to its recall in  Sibutramine once marketed as the diet drug Meridia was   in  after research linked it to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke Six of the  recalled products analyzed in the   study contained sibutramine And despite   by the FDA Zi Xiu Tang Bee Pollen is still   on the Internet Its possible that the manufacturer has changed the formulation since the   study testing was conducted but we were unable to reach the distributor for comment Our email was returned as undeliverable People selling these products should be enforced against to the fullest extent of the law says   CEO of the Natural Product Association a nonprofit trade association that represents supplementmakers and other companies Fabricant points out that products adulterated with drugs are not considered to be supplements so he chafed at the use of the term dietary supplements to describe the products analyzed in the   study The products analyzed in this study arent supplements Fabricant told NPR People selling these products online dont represent the industry In a written statement the FDA told NPR that the agency has pursued civil and criminal enforcement against people who illegally market these products but its tough to crack down The supply chain for these products is extremely fragmented an FDA spokesperson said in an email One product manufactured by an unknown company overseas may be sold by dozens of different distributors in the United States In the case of the Zi Xiu Tang Bee Pollen capsules for example even if one distributor is detected and shut down many more may still be selling the product And it can be tough for consumers to know which products might pose dangers Given the uncertainty   a professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of California San Francisco says her advice is to steer clear of all weightloss supplements I think whats most striking about the findings of the study is that these supplements pose a significant health risk Tsourounis says And even when weight loss products dont contain banned substances she says theyre unlikely to help None of these supplements Tsourounis says has been adequately tested to demonstrate that it will work to help sustain weight loss over time
