More than  million veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan and they qualify for health care and benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs These recent vets have been putting in for more servicerelated conditions than previous generations for everything from posttraumatic stress disorder and brain injury to the bad knees bad backs and bad hearing that nearly every new vet seems to have But still its not the young vets who are filling up the VA waitlists  that would be the more than   of Vietnam Korea and even World War II who are older and need more care And theyre more likely to be the ones waiting Despite the ugly headlines veterans rate their care and benefits very highly The major hurdle for the VA is access to care The issue of wait times has plagued the Veterans Health Administration VHA for years The departments own inspector general has issued  reports on the subject since  all warning that veterans were waiting too long for medical appointments It may just be simple math The department says that in the past year primary care visits rose  percent while the number of primary care doctors went up just  present The recent scandal is less about the wait times and more about covering them up The inspector general also has repeatedly  warned of serious flaws in the VAs internal reporting on whether a patient was seen within the target time of  days VA had claimed to be seeing  percent of patients within  days the inspector general estimated the real number at only  percent Many clinics continued to game the system finding ways to report they had met their performance goals This allowed executives to collect bonuses including those at the now infamous Phoenix VA hospital In April a whistleblower who formerly worked at the Phoenix VA health system   that executives there kept a separate list of how long patients actually waited months but only entered appointments into the VAs electronic database once the wait time would be  days or less The whistleblower Dr Sam Foote claimed as many as  patients died while on that list But there is still no evidence that any of these patients died because of the wait some of them were terminally ill As other whistleblowers came forward around the country the problem of wait times and unofficial lists turned out to be systemic The VAs inspector general is now investigating scores of VA sites An audit ordered by thenVA Secretary Eric Shinseki has estimated that  percent of VA facilities were gaming the system The day he resigned Shinseki admitted he hadnt been aware of how bad the situation was The disability claims backlog is a separate issue from wait times The Veterans Benefits Administration VBA processes claims of servicerelated injury for vets giving them a disability rating that determines how much they may get in a monthly stipend In spring of  the number of claimants who had been waiting more than  days hit a peak over  Part of the problem was new post vets coming back from war and filing claims in high numbers But a large part of the backlog was anticipated In  the VA decided to stop disputing many conditions linked to exposure to Agent Orange The VA also stopped contesting claims from unexplained Gulf War illness and combatrelated PTSD adding hundreds of thousands of new cases to the backlog Through a combination of mandatory overtime and use of a new electronic system as opposed to the VAs previous decades of processing claims on paper the   has been dropping steadily its now below half the peak in March  But some veterans groups point out that the backlog of appealed decisions remains high  and they raise questions about whether   All the major veterans service organizations say they like the care at the VA and they think nothing is better for veterans dealing with PTSD traumatic brain injury spinal injury and care of amputees Studies have shown that veterans who are getting VHA care are less likely to be among the estimated  veterans per day who commit suicide The VBA can offer home loans and the post GI bill for school as well as emergency aid to veterans who find themselves homeless But thats only available to vets who make it through the gantlet of red tape to get an appointment get a disability rating and maybe file a few appeals of decisions along the way The term red tape possibly originated from the tape used to bind Civil War veterans records Many veterans advocates say they fear that the latest scandals will scare vets away from all the help the VA can lend   in   said public confidence in VA care has dropped to a new low Just  in  had a favorable view of the job government is doing taking care of veterans
