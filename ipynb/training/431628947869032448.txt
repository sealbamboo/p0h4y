The recent announcement that data from individuals GP records would be shared with researchers inside the NHS  and potentially outside  was controversial In this weeks Scrubbing Up Prof Peter Johnson Cancer Research UKs chief clinician says while the decision is up to each of us population data like this is crucial for making progress in tackling diseases Patient information is a very controversial issue  We live in an age when all manner of information about us is collected and shared all the time and understandably everyone worries about who is looking at their data and what theyre doing with it   But using our records for medical research is not about some sort of freeforall with peoples data It is about doing the right thing and using the information that we collect in the NHS to benefit patients in the future   We need the proper safeguards and I am as sceptical as anyone about the idea of selling the data outside the NHS but that is not a reason to discard the whole idea When we think about cancer research we might picture scientists working in labs or patients on clinical trials but this isnt the full story  There are researchers making vital discoveries and saving lives right now who will never touch a test tube and may never meet a patient  These are the population researchers who work with vast databases of patient records who have made some of the most important discoveries in medicine and their type of research is as important as ever Cancer research is a huge success story we know so much more now than we did  years ago   But we dont know everything  Patient data can be used to answer some of the big questions about cancer what causes it how do we treat it and how do we cure it For us one of the most valuable parts of the NHS is the National Cancer Registration Service which covers the whole of the UK and stretches back over  years   This system provided the data needed to show that mesothelioma is caused by asbestos exposure and gave us the evidence behind the new innovations in the bowel screening programme   It gives us some of the best information in the world about how well or badly we are doing and is vital for making sure we keep improving cancer treatments all the time But without access to peoples records to track how a type of treatment works this is a wasted opportunity Cancer registries have already saved many lives and in the future they will save many more However they are under serious threat from legislation in the European Union  The registries collect data from cancer patients automatically although patients can object to their details being shared   Under the new European Data Protection Regulation this would become illegal and we are worried our national cancer registries could collapse completely If cancer registration is allowed to fail in this way a unique weapon in the fight against cancer will be lost  Our registries are a precious resource and we must protect them   It is absolutely critical that the UK government lobbies effectively in the EU to ensure that registries and other population research is protected from this regulation The choice is yours Population research involves huge numbers but we always remember that behind every database containing a million pieces of information there are a million individuals and their care   We work with information from millions of people but every one of those has generously shared their information and is making an individual contribution to our research   We respect that and recognise what a valuable thing this trust is Unlike many of the people involved in this debate Im not here to tell you what to do  Its your data its your decision    Everyone in England has a decision to make   NHS England is soon going to be uploading GP records into a central database which will be used in planning healthcare and in research   This can be a huge force for good if we get it right   We need to make sure that we have rules to protect us properly but at the same time make sure we can carry on with essential research
