  Its common sense that alcohol could play a significant role in some divorces but a new study shows its likely to play a bigger role when theres an imbalance in drinking habits between husband and wife most notably when the wife is the heavy drinker According to the study conducted at the   and to be published in May in   drinking itself is a risk factor for divorce but incompatible drinking  that is partners consuming widely differing amounts of alcohol  poses an even greater divorce risk Heavy alcohol consumption is a problem of great public health concern in most Western societies said Ellinor F Major PhD director of the division of mental health at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in a press release It often leads to   The present study adds to our understanding of the predictive value of alcohol use and particularly of discordant alcohol consumption for marital dissolution Researchers examined data from a past study conducted in one Norwegian county from  to  to gather information on alcohol use and mental distress in   Using a timetoevent prediction model they assessed divorce risk within the  years that followed Essentially the more people drink the higher is the risk of divorce said study author Fartein Ask Torvik PhD a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in the press release In addition the risk of divorce is lowered if the spouses drink approximately the same amount of alcohol This is not only true for those who drink excessively  there is also a reduced risk of divorce if both spouses abstain totally from alcohol Also we found heavy drinking among women to be more strongly associated with divorce than heavy drinking among men This latter finding is of major interest added Dr Torvik For instance the risk of divorce is estimated to be tripled when the   compared with couples where both drink lightly Excessive drinking is not only rarer among women but is also socially less acceptable and Torvik emphasized in the release women are more heavily affected by extreme drinking which in turn is responsible for additional impairment A wifes heavy drinking probably also interferes more with general family life  that is the caring role of the mother upbringing of children etc added Dr Major Perhaps the husband is more apt to leave the spouse than is the wife when major problems occur These factors may account for the higher risk for marital dissolution when the wife is a heavy drinker than when the husband is a heavy drinker Since the degree of one spouses drinking can impact the quality of a marriage Major suggests taking measures to change drinking habits as a way to prevent future marital issues Someone with a light or moderate alcohol use who has a spouse who drinks heavily should encourage that spouse to change their drinking pattern into a light or moderate level if the main concern is a lasting marriage of good quality Good advice probably would be to encourage a similar pattern of moderate or light drinking in both spouses she said in the release Aside from marriage and divorce couples should also consider the effects that disproportionate   as well as their childrens health and safety I would also like to add that we have only been looking into divorce  alcohol may lead to other social or health problems Torvik noted
