his week David Tredinnick MP for Bosworth Conservative Capricorn told us that astrology and homeopathy   In the past hes told the House of Commons of the   in treating HIV tuberculosis and malaria He is welcome to join me on my neurology ward rounds this week He is welcome to meet the family of a yearold woman in intensive care who has meningitis from fulminant tuberculosis He is welcome to offer her family the option of treating their daughter with a homeopathic elixir that will slowly drip through her intravenous cannula And he is welcome to tell the family the result of his experiment This piece is not about   because lots of other people have written about that Tredinnicks comments draw attention to much broader issues in the NHS how best to use its finite resources in its current perilous state and how to ensure solid science drives these difficult decisions But in case you need a refresher on homeopathy  its core principle is like cures like Take a substance that causes a given illness dilute it until youre exhausted from all the diluting and now swallow it in a sugar pill Rather poetically success results since molecules in highly diluted substances retain a memory of the original substance Back to Tredinnick who was elected by fellow MPs to the health select committee   that science has worked out that hangovers and visits to ones GP may be affected by the awesome power of the moon Isnt it a good thing that nobody in the government listens to him And isnt it good that our limited NHS funds are not wasted on quackery Hang on It transpires that Tredinnick and the health secretary Jeremy Hunt are pen pals with benefits Hunt flew the flag for homeopathy in  signing an   to embrace NHS homeopathic hospitals In an LBC interview last year he   Without really thinking I signed up to it This is the sort of thing one might say the morning after drunkenly signing up to Tinder  less so having signed a parliamentary motion The House of Commons science and technology committee unambiguously concluded in  that the   When the NHS funds homeopathy it endorses it Yet Hunt following lobbying from Tredinnick   into it Hunt is not alone in his enthusiasm to spend NHS money in this manner The Green party leader Natalie Bennett is said to   in the NHS Ukip has previously supported NHSfunded homeopathy but its last manifesto thankfully fell silent on the issue Labour has reassured us that Luciana Berger its public health spokesman   The Liberal Democrats manifesto is en route but Tredinnicks Lib Dem opponent Michael Mullaney   If even Dr Wollaston a fellow Conservative MP is saying David Tredinnick is wrong and should be ignored it is time he listened and stopped opening his mouth on things he knows nothing about The NHS is on the brink of a financial crisis The   that the next government will arrive in office with the NHS facing financial meltdown and social care in crisis An additional bn a year in funding is needed by  with bn of productivity improvements One could argue that the amount spent on discredited treatments such as homeopathy is a drop in the ocean in light of these daunting figures One oftquoted government response is that homeopathic prescriptions accounted for only  of the total  prescribing budget But this does not tell the whole story In  the NHS paid  for homeopathic prescriptions This equates to salaries for up five specialist nurses   include  MRI scans or  cataract operations  definitely not a drop in the ocean At last count up to  of clinical commissioning groups were still funding homeopathy South Gloucestershire CCG for example spent   It could have   with that money A new specialist epilepsy nurse   by up to half saving more than  a year The governments   on the registration of homeopathic products met four times in   thats  members being paid  per meeting plus expenses or  The Glasgow Centre of Integrative Care formerly known as the Homeopathic Hospital   funded by NHS boards that seem to be ignoring the House of Commons  recommendation I want to use my vote  not astrology  to help the NHS but I am still not sure which party to vote for Uncertain as to how to ensure NHS resources are funnelled towards evidencebased treatments and not quackery Party manifestos across the political spectrum will be released in the coming days and an unequivocal stance on these issues would help In the meantime i   or not funding for that matter David Tredinnick youre still welcome to join me on that ward round Im a Gemini by the way I hope that wont put you off
