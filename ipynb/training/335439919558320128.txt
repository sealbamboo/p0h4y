Staying in a nonsmoking room in a hotel that allows smoking elsewhere does not prevent exposure to tobacco smoke a new study reports  researchers examined a sample of  hotels with complete smoking bans and  with designated smoking rooms They analyzed air and surfaces for tobacco smoke pollutants took finger wipe samples to measure the presence of tobacco carcinogens and tested the urine of nonsmoking occupants after they had stayed in the rooms Some nonsmoking rooms were quite low in pollutants But at their worst levels of tobacco air pollutants were almost five times as high in nonsmoking rooms as they were in rooms of nonsmoking hotels and pollution of surfaces was up to  times as high In some cases nonsmokers who stayed in nonsmoking rooms had signs of nicotine exposure in their urine that were more than twice as high as those of nonsmokers who stayed in nonsmoking hotels Vermont prohibits smoking in public areas of hotels but not in private rooms Indiana Michigan North Dakota and Wisconsin prohibit any smoking in hotels Designated smoking rooms do not work according to the studys lead author Georg E Matt a professor of psychology at San Diego State University Smokers leave a legacy behind that they cannot control he said The physical reservoirs  in the fabrics the blankets the upholstery the drywall  are very deep and you cant just take them out
