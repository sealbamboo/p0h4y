The manufacturer of a hospital feed strongly linked to the death of one baby and illness of  others has said it is saddened by what has happened ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling said it was cooperating fully with an inquiry by health officials The baby died from blood poisoning at St Thomas Hospital in south London from suspected contaminated drip food Public Health England said babies at six hospitals developed septicaemia from the Bacillus cereus bacterium Ms Hamling said in a statement ITH Pharma is very saddened to hear about the death of a baby in hospital and that  others are ill with septicaemia ITH Pharma is a specialist manufacturer of parenteral nutrition which is given to babies in neonatal intensive care units The products in question which are no longer in circulation are made to order for individual patients on a daily basis in response to bespoke orders from hospitals We are cooperating fully with the MHRA Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the investigation and are doing everything we can to help them establish the facts in this case as quickly as possible Public Health England PHE said the cases were strongly linked with a number of batches of a particular form of the intravenous liquid made by the Londonbased company Paul Cosford PHEs director of health protection told BBC Radio s Today programme that a possible point when contamination entered the products last week had been identified They are believed to have been made on Tuesday  March The baby died on Sunday after being diagnosed the previous day The babies affected many of whom were premature were being cared for in neonatal intensive care units and were given the feed direct to their bloodstream as they could not be fed by mouth The cases were reported at The hospitals said the surviving babies were responding well to antibiotics and their parents had been informed An investigation has been launched by PHE and the MHRA PHE said inquiries with ITH Pharma had identified an incident that might have caused the contamination A PHE spokeswoman said Many of the babies were premature and very vulnerable and one baby has sadly died but the others are responding to antibiotic treatment ITH Pharma has launched a product recall to which the MHRA has issued an alert to hospitals PHE said doctors had been given advice on identifying any potential cases of infection and how to dispose of affected stock PHE incident director Professor Mike Catchpole said Given that the bacteria is widely spread in the environment we are continuing to investigate any other potential sources of infection However all our investigations to date indicate that the likely source of the infection has been identified We have acted quickly to investigate this issue alongside the MHRA and we have taken action to ensure that the affected batches and any remaining stock of this medicine is not being used in hospitals Adam Burgess manager of the MHRAs defective medicines reporting centre said We have sent inspectors to the manufacturers facility to carry out a detailed and rigorous inspection and we have ensured that the potentially affected medicine is recalled Officials said they were not expecting any more cases Dr Martin Ward Platt of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said blood poisoning caused by Bacillus cereus was extremely rare Any baby developing such a serious infection can suffer from fever pauses in their breathing and vomiting amongst other symptoms he said It is very important to treat suspected infections as early as possible as they can be fatal It seems that the recently reported infections and a tragic death have been associated with an intravenous feeding product The immediate response has been for the affected hospitals to stop using the product and it is generally easy for them to switch to alternative suppliers so that babies who need intravenous feeding do not go without it for a prolonged period Naturally parents whose babies are in intensive care anywhere in the country may be concerned and if so I would urge them to talk to the doctors and nurses looking after their baby
