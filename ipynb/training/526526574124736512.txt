A leading malaria control expert has said efforts to contain the disease may be jeopardised by the Ebola crisis  Dr Fatoumata NafoTraor who heads the Roll Back Malaria RBM Partnership said after visiting west Africa Understandably all the health workers attention is on Ebola Childrens wards which used to be full of malaria patients were becoming ghost areas she added In  malaria killed  people in the three countries worst hit by Ebola Most of these will have been young children  although malaria is curable  The disease caused almost  deaths in Sierra Leone in   as well as around  deaths in Liberia and approximately  in Guinea Now the three countries are wrestling with the Ebola virus and Dr NafoTraor said she feared that recent gains in preventing malaria could be threatened by the crisis She said These countries have previously been really hit by malaria But five years ago it was even worse  the deaths were double We all agree that no child should die from malaria because we have the tools to prevent and treat it But now understandably all the health workers attention is on Ebola We used to see hospital beds with three children in them at a time because there was not enough space Now those paediatric wards are becoming ghost areas because of the lack of manpower there So we dont know who has malaria and who is dying from it  Even if the situation is at the same level as last year that was still very bad in those countries Were really concerned that Ebola will cause a setback to the efforts on malaria And theres a lack of trust and confidence in health workers Theres still a feeling its them who are bringing the virus to people RBM is a partnership of more than  organisations It was formed  years ago to coordinate global efforts against malaria  It says Guinea and Sierra Leone met key targets last year for distributing bed nets  a crucial weapon for protecting children from mosquitoes which spread malaria  The situation in Liberia was less positive Officials there are trying to work out how they can boost their distribution efforts while trying to contain Ebola too One problem is that the early symptoms of Ebola and malaria can be similar Dr NafoTraor travelled by road from Conakry in Guinea to Sierra Leone earlier this month  She told me The Ebola treatment centres have a protocol for treating cases of fever with antimalarial drugs too because the patient might be suffering from both diseases But at the moment when people have fevers they are often afraid to go to healthcare facilities because they want to avoid being held in the Ebola treatment centres We are working with the countries to ensure people are tested for malaria and get the drugs  Its important to have a coordinated approach A key aim is to decrease cases of malariarelated fever so the Ebola centres dont get overwhelmed  Im worried because of the weak health systems And communication is so easy between all  of the West African countries In the past Ebola occurred in remote bush areas But today its happening in capital cities  People are getting wellorganised now As I travelled by road there I saw checkpoints where people were having their temperature taken and were washing their hands  Fortunately the world has received a wakeup call  but the response was slow at the beginning
