Youre so predictable Every day you run out of steam lose juice or otherwise hit the wall at nearly the exact same times How do we know Because it happens to everyone Okay maybe not to Kelly Ripa but to everyone else In fact its like clockwork which actually makes sense because your body clock is part of the problem  when your internal chronometer is out of whack you feel wiped out There are other reasons too We detail all of them on these pages and provide a quick fix  or at least a workaround  for each power suck Consider your energy crisis solved You would think that if there were one time youd feel naturally alert and energized it would be after  hours of resting and recharging Instead your mind is mush Why Blame a phenomenon called sleep inertia When you first awaken the parts of your brain associated with consciousness  the thalamus and brain stem  begin firing right away But the prefrontal cortex which handles problem solving and complex thought is like a cold engine  it needs time to warm up Sleep inertia can last for up to  hours although its most severe within the first  minutes of waking says Kenneth Wright PhD an assistant professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Wright and his colleagues discovered just how severe in a new study which shows that the mental impairment caused by sleep inertia is akin to being intoxicated Adding to your addled state is the fact that you also have a nearly empty fuel tank Your brain needs a continuous supply of glucose to function optimally says Caroline Mahoney PhD a research psychologist at the US Army Soldier Center Fill it up Make your morning meal a bowl of instant oatmeal prepared with skim milk Tufts University researchers recently found that people who ate one packet of instant oatmeal spiked with  cup of skim milk received a steady glucose infusion which increased their alertness all morning and improved their ability to process information And if you arent already jolting yourself with java start a University of Pennsylvania study shows that a dose of caffeine can combat sleep inertia Just dont let a latte replace a real meal It will mask your low blood sugar by temporarily stimulating your brain says Dan Benardot PhD RD an associate professor of nutrition at Georgia State University But you wont have done anything to satisfy the need for energy  If your typical lunch consists of carbs a la starch then youve experienced this earlyafternoon brain drain Thats because a highcarbohydrate meal is the surest way to cause your insulin levels to spike  and your concentration to crash A high insulin response will rapidly take too much sugar out of your blood says Benardot Then your brain doesnt have enough of its primary fuel so you become mentally fatigued Order a combo meal If you cant or wont limit your lunchtime carbohydrate consumption work in extra fiber to slow your digestion and the release of insulin says Susan Kleiner PhD RD owner of the consulting firm High Performance Nutrition For example if your noon nosh includes a baked potato make sure you eat the skin which is dense with a type of fiber called pectin Pectin slows everything down in the gastrointestinal tract says Kleiner When food passes more slowly through the intestines absorption into the bloodstream proceeds in a more timedrelease fashion More ways to fortify your lunch with fiber In those instances when you give in to a binge snack on grapes or an apple afterward either fruit will help stabilize your blood sugar says Benardot  Deep down inside youre a conflicted man In one corner theres your body clock aka your circadian clock which fights to keep you awake until bedtime In the other corner theres your homeostatic system which competes to make you sleepy And every day between approximately  pm and  pm the homeostatic system tries to score a knockout We think the afternoon dip in alertness occurs because the drive from the circadian clock to stay awake is not yet strong enough to cancel out the sleep drive caused by having been awake for half the day says Wright Expose yourself As in give yourself a shot of sunlight The suns rays will provide a boost to your circadian clock that should solve your afternoon slump  if you time things right The key is adequate exposure to sunlight very quickly after you wake up in the morning says Michael Terman PhD a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University medical center As you move into the middle of the day the same amount of light exposure doesnt affect the circadian clock at all That said take it outside in the afternoon anyway British researchers recently found that when people exercised during their workday  regardless of the duration or intensity of the movement  they were less likely to feel fatigued and that translated into a  percent improvement in job performance Its the catch of exercising in the early evening You know that working out will leave you energized but you dont have the energy to work out In most cases the problem is simply that youve forgotten a critical piece of exercise equipment food If youre going into a workout when you havent eaten since lunch your blood sugar will be low again says Kleiner Snack before you sweat Schedule a small snack roughly an hour and a half before your postwork workout The ideal mini meal totals  calories and consists of  to  grams g carbohydrates  to  g protein and up to  g fat says Kleiner Two handfuls of pretzels and two slices of cheese fits the nutritional bill as does a Myoplex Lite bar Then before you hit the locker room grab the original energy drink Gatorade It hasnt really been improved upon says Laura Dunne MD of the Sports Medicine Institute at Orthopaedic Associates of Allentown in Pennsylvania The simple sugars will cause a fast spike in your bloodsugar level so youll have immediate energy At the same time youll be addressing dehydration another hidden cause of fatigue Often that sluggish feeling has more to do with not having had enough fluid than with anything else says Dr Dunne Theres no complicated biochemical reason for being tired now  you worked all day But its early and even if you dont have plans falling asleep now will only screw up your body clock and leave you feeling more fatigued in the am Going to bed a couple of hours earlier than you normally do will throw off your rhythms while consistency can really help you feel alert during the day says Philip Gehrman PhD an assistant professor of psychology at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia Rock yourself awake First do not stretch out on the couch or recline in your easy chair Underlying sleepiness becomes more apparent when we put ourselves in sleepconducive positions such as lying down says Wright And instead of turning on the TV power up your iPod To increase the perception of energy listen to a piece of music that is upbeat and familiar and use that song to get you going says Andrea Scheve director of the University of Pittsburgh medical center musictherapy program Even just thinking about it and hearing it in your mind can give you a boost of energy What you do with this newfound energy is up to you but if you have a significant other now actually might be the perfect time to head for bed  It would be funny if it werent so frustrating You spend the entire day fighting fatigue only to slip into bed shut your eyes and suddenly realize that you now have too much energy Fortunately theres an explanation and its pure Pavlov Do you do anything in bed besides sleep Maybe read watch TV or play Sudoku These activities train the brain to associate the bed with excitement says Kenneth Wright PhD an assistant professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Some people become so sensitive to this that when they go to bed all of a sudden their brains aroused because normally theyre watching a basketball game or reading a favorite book Which means the fix is what sleep researchers have recommended all along no books no Leno and definitely no laptop when youre under the covers Sex is fine  it is after all natures perfect sleep
