But anyone who follows fitness science     knows that in recent years a variety of experiments have undermined that idea Instead researchers have discovered this socalled static stretching can lessen jumpers heights and sprinters speeds without substantially reducing peoples chances of hurting themselves Now two new studies are giving us additional reasons not to stretch One a study being published this month in   concluded that if you stretch before you lift weights you may find yourself feeling weaker and wobblier than you expect during your workout Those findings join those of another new study from Croatia a bogglingly comprehensive reanalysis of data from earlier experiments that was   Together the studies augment a growing scientific consensus that preexercise stretching is generally unnecessary and likely counterproductive Many issues related to exercise and stretching have remained unresolved In particular it is unclear to what extent precisely subsequent workouts are changed when you stretch beforehand as well as whether all types of physical activity are similarly affected  For the more wideranging of the new studies and to partially fill that knowledge gap researchers at the University of Zagreb began combing through hundreds of earlier experiments in which volunteers stretched and then jumped dunked sprinted lifted or otherwise had their muscular strength and power tested For their purposes the Croatian researchers wanted studies that used only static stretching as an exclusive warmup they excluded past experiments in which people stretched but also jogged or otherwise actively warmed up before their exercise session  The scientists wound up with  past studies that met their criteria Then they amalgamated those studies results and using sophisticated statistical calculations determined just how much stretching impeded subsequent performance  The numbers especially for competitive athletes are sobering According to their calculations static stretching reduces strength in the stretched muscles by almost  percent with the impact increasing in people who hold individual stretches for  seconds or more While the effect is reduced somewhat when peoples stretches last less than  seconds stretched muscles are in general substantially less strong  They also are less powerful with power being a measure of the muscles ability to produce force during contractions according to Goran Markovic a professor of kinesiology at the University of Zagreb and the studys senior author In Dr Markovic and his colleagues reanalysis of past data they determined that muscle power generally falls by about  percent after stretching  And as a result they found explosive muscular performance also drops off significantly by as much as  percent That means that someone trying to burst from the starting blocks blast out a ballistic first tennis serve clean and jerk a laden barbell block a basketball shot or even tick off a fleet opening mile in a marathon will be ill served by stretching first Their performance after warming up with stretching is likely to be worse than if they hadnt warmed up at all  A similar conclusion was reached by the authors of the other new study in which young fit men performed standard squats with barbells after either first stretching or not The volunteers could manage  percent less weight after the static stretching But even more interesting they also reported that they felt less stable and more unbalanced after the stretching than when they didnt stretch  Just why stretching hampers performance is not fully understood although the authors of both of the new studies write that they suspect the problem is in part that stretching does exactly what we expect it to do It loosens muscles and their accompanying tendons But in the process it makes them less able to store energy and spring into action like lax elastic waistbands in old shorts which Im certain have added significantly to the pokiness of some of my past race times by requiring me manually to hold up the garment  Of course the new studies findings primarily apply to people participating in events that require strength and explosive power more so than endurance But some research speaks in favor of static stretching impairing performance in distance running and cycling Dr Markovic said  More fundamentally the results underscore the importance of not prepping for exercise by stretching he said We can now say for sure that static stretching alone is not recommended as an appropriate form of warmup he said A warmup should improve performance he pointed out not worsen it  A better choice he continued is to warmup dynamically by moving the muscles that will be called upon in your workout Jumping jacks and toysoldierlike high leg kicks for instance prepare muscles for additional exercise better than stretching As an unscientific side benefit they can also be fun
