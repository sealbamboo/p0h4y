The risk of developing the deadliest form of skin cancer may be closely tied to sun exposure in youth a new study suggests The new research found that women who had at least five blistering sunburns during their teenage years had a greater likelihood of developing any of the three main forms of skin cancer But the risk was particularly high for melanoma which kills an estimated  Americans a year Women who were consistently exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet radiation as adults did not have an increased risk for melanoma But they did have more than double the risk of developing basal and squamous cell carcinoma two common but less lethal forms of skin cancer  The findings published in   were based on an analysis of  Caucasian women who were followed for  years as part of the nationwide Nurses Health Study II Throughout the study the women routinely provided details about their medical histories as well as information on things like their use of tanning beds and any sunburns or moles on their skin The findings suggest that parents should be particularly mindful about protecting their children from burns and chronic exposure said Dr Abrar A Qureshi an author of the study and chairman  of dermatology at the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University For melanoma were not discounting the exposure later in life but early sun exposure seems to be a very important factor he said  This doesnt mean that youre off the hook if youre careful early in life Dr Qureshi added since too much sun exposure at any age is linked to an increased risk of other forms of skin cancer
