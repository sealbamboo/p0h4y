The volunteers provided data on their oral health as well as on their HPVinfection status Those who reported poor oral health had a  higher rate of HPV infection than those whose mouths were healthy and people who had gum disease and dental problems had a  higher risk of being infected with HPV than those who didnt have these issues The connection between the virus which is most often associated with sexually transmitted diseases and oral cancers only emerged about five years ago Dr Maura Gillison a professor at Ohio State University who studies HPV infections in the head throat and neck   Every year in the United States more than  new cases of   are diagnosed in women and about  are diagnosed in men White men have the highest rates of HPVrelated throat cancer fueling a recent rise in HPVrelated oral cancers overall while tumors associated with tobacco have been declining  In the US there is an active shift going on Gillison told TIME Fortunately thanks to tobacco policy and publichealth awareness the incidence rate for the classical head and neck cancer caused by smoking is declining But unfortunately the rate of oropharynx cancer is still going up and its because of the HPV component Some of that rise can be attributed to barriers that public health campaigns faced in addressing a sexually transmitted virus When two vaccines that protect against the most common forms of HPV became available after  for example political and social resistance to vaccinating young girls as part of the childhood vaccination schedule led to slow uptake of the inoculation  Parents and politicians worried that the shot would promote promiscuity among preadolescents and were also concerned about reports that the immunizations caused serious side effects such as fainting There were even   Both proved unfounded as studies verified the   and the   among vaccinated girls If left untreated HPV can cause cancers in the cervix anus penis vulva vagina as well as in the head and neck Some forms of the virus also contribute to genital warts but the latest studies suggest that the HPV vaccines can lower infection rates and therefore may be important weapons in fighting not just cervical cancer but oral cancers as well Thats important since there is currently no scientifically proven way of testing for oral HPV which makes monitoring for these virusrelated cancers in the mouth more challenging and preventing them more critical Even without a shot however the researchers say their results hint that it may be relatively easy to control HPV in the oropharynx  by brushing regularly and keeping the mouth environment clean  The good news is the risk factor is modifiable  by maintaining good oral hygiene and good oral health one can prevent HPV infection and subsequent HPVrelated cancers said study author Thanh Cong Bui a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in a statement And there are other benefits to brushing as well Good oral health may also prevent other conditions such as the gum disease gingivitis which has been linked to heart disease A healthy mouth it seems can also be a sign of a healthy body
