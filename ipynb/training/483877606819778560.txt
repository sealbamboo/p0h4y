Malaria parasites can manipulate the body odour of mice research in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests  Researchers believe parasites may change odours in order to help them with a key stage in their reproduction  And scientists found the altered scent persists at a critical time when mice have no symptoms but remain infectious They are working on further trials to determine whether parasites can affect human smell too Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Pennsylvania State University in the US studied the odour of mice with and without malaria for  days  They found the scent of infected mice was markedly different to noninfected ones  The parasite did not completely alter the smell of the individual  instead it changed the level of compounds already present in mouse odour  And this was particularly noticeable in mice which were still infectious but no longer showed any symptoms of the disease  corresponding to a crucial time in the life cycle of the parasite  Prof Consuelo De Moraes of Pennsylvania State University and one of the lead authors of the research said There appears to be an overall elevation of several compounds that are attractive to mosquitoes  The study showed mosquitoes were most attracted to mice when the parasites in their bodies were at a key point in their development   a stage when they needed to be passed back to a mosquito in order to reproduce  Malaria parasites have a complex lifecycle with several stages They need to develop and mature in both humans and mosquitoes  Scientists believe parasites may manipulate the hosts smell in order to ensure continued survival Researchers are now working on trials to see if this pattern of odour change can be traced in humans too  Professor Mark Mescher of Pennsylvania State University who was also involved in the research told the BBC One of the major potential values of this research is if it can help us identify people who do not show symptoms of the disease  Without symptoms people carry the disease without treatment and still transmit it But there is still a long way to go In mice we have a very controlled environment In humans there are so many different factors at play  from diverse environments to diverse genes  Dr James Logan of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was not involved in the research said This is one of the first convincing studies that demonstrates a significant change in odour compounds from malariainfected mammals can affect mosquito behaviour The strength of this paper is in the experimental approaches used combining analytical chemistry statistical analyses and mosquito behaviour  However this demonstration is in an animal model which may or may not relate to human beings infected with malaria
