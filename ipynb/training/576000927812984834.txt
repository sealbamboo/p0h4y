Although we all laughed at the time it was with a bit of shiftyeyed shame Because most of us including if not particularly the illustrious Ehrlich family have lurking within us our very own White Bread Lady ready to convince us that each cough sniffle and lessthannutritious meal might be a detriment to our health  And naturally that White Bread Lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information Yup so quoth Google we all have cancer According to the Pew Research Center  of Internet users have looked up health information online While that practice can be beneficial in some respects the abundance of variably valid information online can turn us into ehypochondriacs Or worse can lead us to neglect getting the care we need Read on for five mistakes  courtesy of a selection of health care professionals  that people make when diagnosing themselves online Your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair  You type eye twitch into Google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open revealing to you wonders untold You are the chosen one Too bad that this trove of medical information is actually some dudes fanfiction site Sure the above is an extreme example but as Dr Kevin Pho of   pointed out Theres a lot of bad information on the Web and information that can be dangerous Especially if youre not considering who put up that information in the first place Pho urges users to favor Web addresses ending in org and edu when looking for reputable healthcare info and to check who is funding the collection of that information Theres so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the Web he said  He suggests turning to sites like   as well as troves of information curated by doctors like Phos own website when trolling the web for info And of course if a site mentions trolls and third eyes one should definitely press on If theres one thing people like to do online its talk about their problems  especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies various and sundry discharges  Thats all well and good sharing experiences with others is enriching Unless the people youre sharing with are idiots  You can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really isnt relevant but maybe sounds kind of close warned Craig Monsen cofounder of symptomchecker app   On the other hand sometimes youll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem and their solution does help  Health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms added Dr Natasha Burgert of   I think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community The trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you And you know if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach maybe click off and see a doc You know that game  Degrees of Kevin Bacon There should seriously be a version of that called  Degrees of Cancer  as in when looking up your symptoms online how long does it take to deduce that you have a lifethreatening disease instead of say a simple cold According to Burgert the root of this whole worstcase scenario thing is getting too emotional  For most intents and purposes when youre looking for online health information its about yourself or a family member she said When youre looking through that lens its very hard to keep emotional distance So you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears  and thats the path youll continue down whether its correct or not Burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to understand possible diagnoses find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home  SymCat and Mayo Clinics   let you type in what youre experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctors aid Your doctors website might also have such a tool  Voila you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees I think traditionally many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the Internet Pho said But I think more and more doctors are accepting it Personally I think that transparency of information is helpful in a way Translation Help your doctor help you If youre worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down whats ailing you share that info with your physician I really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns Burgert said People get scared when they get sick and hurt and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves The Internet adds to that physicians expertise in order to do that Remember though knowing how to use the Internet doesnt make you a doctor Google doesnt count as a second opinion If youre unhappy with your docs diagnosis go get one the traditional way If your ailment isnt going away all the symptomchecking and Mayo Clinicing in the world isnt going to help you  Make a doctors appointment Like right now  Sites like   make it super easy and free doctors pay to be listed to set up an appointment ASAP so no whining that youll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then it will have gone away  Unless of course it is that white bread you just ate In that case please stop calling my dad
