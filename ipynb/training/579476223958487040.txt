It is used by almost a tenth of the worlds population It gives people a buzz equivalent to six cups of coffee and is used variously as a symbol of love marriage and a cure for indigestion and impotence  But it is also leading tens of thousands to an early grave The culprit The humble betel nut  Found across Asia these nuts are harvested from the Areca palm and are chewed for their warming glow and stimulating properties  Such is its effectiveness that alongside nicotine alcohol and caffeine betel nuts are believed to be one of the most popular mindaltering substances in the world  Although used by women and children the nuts are especially popular among workingage men who chew to stay awake through long hours of driving fishing or working on construction sites  But the shortlived benefits come at a terrible cost  High rates of oral cancer are destroying the lives of many who buy betel nuts often decades after their first taste Now in Taiwan where the nuts are affectionately known as Taiwans chewing gum the government is taking action to curb this centuriesold habit and reduce the thousands of lives lost each year   The betel nut is a key part of many Asian cultures and can be consumed dried fresh or wrapped up in a package known as a quid  Although the exact preparation varies across countries and cultures the quid is usually a mixture of slaked lime a betel leaf and flavourings such as cardamom cinnamon and tobacco  Worryingly the International Agency for Research on Cancer lists each ingredient with the exception of cardamom and cinnamon as a known carcinogen  or cancercausing agent  The slaked lime is seen as a particular problem as it causes hundreds of tiny abrasions to form in the mouth This is thought to be a possible entry point for many of the cancercausing chemicals About half of the men here still dont know that betel nuts can cause oral cancer says Prof Hahn Liangjiunn an oral cancer specialist at the National Taiwan University Hospital  This is despite Taiwans incidence or mortality rates for oral cancer ranking among the top two or three in the world Like most people Qiu Zhenhuang  was completely unaware of the risks  A former gravel company worker he chewed for ten years Twenty years after quitting he developed the disease I started chewing betel nut because everyone at work did it says Mr Qiu We shared it with each other to build good relations Three years ago a small hole developed in his left cheek and in just three months the tumour grew to the size of a golf ball and completely changed his life  Whatever I ate flowed out I had a gauze pad over it It hurt he said  It affected me a lot I was so ashamed I avoided going out Each year  Taiwanese men like Mr Qiu are diagnosed with oral cancer or precancerous lesions and an estimated  to  of those also chew betel nuts  An early symptom includes white or red lesions inside the mouth but this can rapidly progress to grotesque flesheating tumours  Unlike other cancers these are difficult to hide leaving sufferers physically and psychologically devastated Its miserable for them says Prof Hahn  Sometimes even after surgery they still cant perform basic functions including expressing emotions through their face because the lower jaw also has to be cut depending on the scale of the cancer Luckily for Qiu Zhenhuang his cancer was treated and his cheek reconstructed  But the Taiwanese government is helping people detect the disease more quickly by providing around one million free screenings and funding programs to help people quit betel nuts for good  In  these measures helped cut the usage rate among men by nearly half Critics argue that action should have been taken much sooner as the cancer risk of betel nuts has been known since   However pressure from those working in the industry has provided strong opposition to change  Now the government is trying to reduce the domestic supply of betel nuts by offering subsidies to farmers to cut down their trees and plant alternative crops  Other countries such as India and Thailand have also launched campaigns to discourage betel nut chewing But there is still a way to go At a recent presentation to elementary school children of fishing industry workers nearly all raised their hands when asked whether their parents or relatives chewed betel nuts And as the cancer can take up to  years to appear the current changes will have come too late for many people  a fact that Mr Qiu keeps close to his heart  Im one of the luckier ones
