Childhood   like those for     carry a small risk of   Some parents postpone their childrens vaccinations because they believe the delay decreases the risk But a new study finds the opposite may be true The analysis   involved  children born from  to  who had seizures in the first two years of life For children who received any of their shots as recommended from ages  to  months there was no difference in the incidence of seizure in the  days after vaccination compared with the period before vaccination But compared with giving it at  to  months giving the measlesmumpsrubella vaccine at  months or later doubled the incidence of seizure and giving the measlesmumpsrubella  vaccine at that age increased it almost six times The risk of seizure after these vaccinations at any age is small  about  in  doses for the MMR and  in  for the MMRV Our study demonstrates a low rate of febrile seizure after the MMR and MMRV vaccines and that this rate is increased if the vaccines are received at an older age said the lead author Dr Simon J Hambidge a researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Colorado Institute for Health Research But he added it is far riskier to delay or avoid vaccination than it is to vaccinate our children
