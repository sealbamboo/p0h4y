New viruses are popping up all over these days    in Missouri last month a new virus in the   in Saudi Arabia this month And now a neverbeforeseen hemorrhagic fever virus in central Africa Its called BasCongo virus after the   where it was found just west of   the teeming capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo The discovery   today in the journal   So far only three people in the remote village of Mangala are known to have contracted BasCongo hemorrhagic fever two of whom died One was a health care worker who cared for the other two villagers which means it can apparently be transmitted from person to person although no one knows how easily But the small number of known cases is actually one of the important things about this finding It signifies that scientists may have found an emerging disease very soon after it made its jump from whatever species it came from into humans Well come back to its most likely origins a little later The reason for thinking BasCongo only recently began infecting humans is that researchers have run blood tests on people throughout the DRC and found no evidence of antibodies that would indicate any of them has been exposed to the new virus It doesnt appear to be widespread throughout the Congo study coauthor   of the University of California San Francisco told Shots He says the team is planning to do more blood tests on people in the DRC and neighboring countries such as CongoBrazzaville right next to BasCongo province I would say we caught it fairly quickly said another study author   in a telephone interview from the other side of the DRC where hes helping to track down the origin of an   hemorrhagic fever that has so far afflicted  people and killed  This wasnt HIV where were  years into a pandemic before we actually find that we have a pandemic says Fair whos with a group called   that contracts with governments and health agencies to track disease outbreaks The three known cases of BasCongo fever actually occurred three years ago But tissue samples from the victims languished in a laboratory freezer in Kinshasa until an astute doctor called the cases to Fairs attention That time lag along with the inability to keep some tissue samples from thawing out has hampered the researchers ability to track the virus through other possible cases in Mangala village There are some other striking things about the new virus It doesnt belong to any of the four families of previously known hemorrhagic viruses  Arenaviridae Bunyaviridae Filoviridae and Flaviviridae These families harbor such notorious bugs as           and  Instead BasCongo belongs to the Rhabdovirus family which has never been known to include human hemorrhagic fever viruses although it does contain one that affects fish That in itself is astonishing Chiu says but even within the rhabdovirus family its very divergent That is it doesnt resemble any other rhabdovirus And where did it come from Thats still a mystery but one clue is that its closest relatives are insect viruses So researchers are trapping mosquitoes sandflies ticks and other insects to see if they can find where BasCongo virus hangs out when its not threatening humans The discovery of BasCongo is only the latest instance of a powerful newish technology that is proving crucial in the identification and characterization of new infectious organisms Its called   and it allows scientists to spell out the millions of nucleotide sequences in any new microbe without reference to those of known pathogens Deep sequencing was also used recently to characterize the new coronavirus that has infected two men in Saudi Arabia and possibly others Once scientists have their hands on the complete genome of these new organisms they can place it on the right family tree relative to known microbes providing crucial clues on where it may have come from and what species it likes to infect They can also as in the case of the Saudi virus and BasCongo make diagnostic tests to see who else has been infected By knowing the genetic identity now we will add this to our battery of tests for hemorrhagic fever cases that come in Fair says Up to  percent of hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in the Congo dont have a diagnosis Chiu says They test negative for Ebola Marburg and everything else So I suspect there are several other viruses out there that have yet to be discovered Fair is confident they will be found thanks to new technologies  from rapidthroughput gene sequencing to solar power to run freezers He foresees a new chapter in the detection of emerging diseases right when they start If we can detect it we can stop it Fair says Thats a bold statement but thats where we aim to be
