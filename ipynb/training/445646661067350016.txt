Everybody knows smoking is hazardous Being around someone who smokes isnt such a good idea either Theres no safe amount of secondhand smoke the surgeon general   Now thirdhand smoke is getting scrutiny Whats thirdhand smoke Its the residue from smoke that settles onto clothes hair furniture or anything else in a smokers vicinity These chemicals can react with others in the air or on surfaces to create even more potentially hazardous substances Thirdhand smoke can grow more toxic over time says   a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory He briefed the media Monday on findings from his labs work on thirdhand smoke presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Dallas The   is fairly new and remains controversial Hangs lab has looked at tobaccospecific chemicals that alter DNA including one called NNA that is very similar to a wellknown and potent carcinogen   Is thirdhand smoke dangerous in the real world Just because something can be detected doesnt prove that its a health hazard We cannot ignore these compounds even though they are in small quantities in thirdhand smoke Hang says Still the press materials released before his talk concede theres a lot of work to do before cause and effect can be shown Just as it took years to establish the cancercausing effects of firsthand smoke that is inhaled as a person breathes in directly from the cigarette making the connection between thirdhand smoke or NNA and cancer could take a long time said a statement attributed to Hang In his remarks to journalists Monday Hang said many clinical studies would have to be performed to characterize the health risks Among other things Hang and his group are looking for chemical markers that would help them identify DNA damage specific to thirdhand smoke exposure Previously Hangs group   in the journal   that said they had demonstrated the toxic potential of thirdhand smoke for human cells This is the very first study to find that thirdhand smoke is mutagenic Lara Gundel a colleague of Hangs and a coauthor of the study   last June Tobaccospecific nitrosamines some of the chemical compounds in thirdhand smoke are among the most potent carcinogens there are A   in   that used mice to assess the health hazards highlighted the knowledge gap The experiments described in the   paper showed that mice exposed to smoke residue but never actual smoke had tissue damage and other changes in health a lot like those seen with secondhand smoke
