 Allergan Inc. Chief Executive David Pyott is looking at potential sizable acquisitions, at the urging of his shareholders, he said on Wednesday, as he seeks to fight off a $53 billion hostile offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and activist investor William Ackman.. Mr. Pyott, in an interview, said he was always looking at potential targets and pointed to an estimated $14 billion in future free-cash flow and his company's ability to easily raise a hefty amount of debt as giving him the firepower for a deal.
