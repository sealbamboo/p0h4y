If the measles outbreak and resulting vaccine debate wasnt a political issue before this week began it is now Thanks to New Jersey Governor Chris Christies offthecuff statements in the UK on Monday endorsing a measure of choice as to whether to immunise their children against measles several of his fellow highprofile presidential aspirants have decided to weigh in on the topic On Monday evening former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came down firmly on the provaccine side   The science is clear The earth is round the sky is blue and vaccineswork Lets protect all our kids She ended her message with the hashtag GrandmothersKnowBest yet another hint that her newly minted grandmaternal status could be leaned on heavily to provide her with a softer image as she gears up for her possible campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination Meanwhile Kentucky Senator Rand Paul took a decidedly different tack on Monday reiterating his position that most vaccines should be voluntary and that parental choice is an issue of freedom I dont understand the point of why that would be controversial the Republican told a   adding that hes a big fan of vaccines But he said I have heard of many tragic cases of walking talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines  The state doesnt own your children Mr Paul who has placed near the top of many polls of Republican primary voters concluded Parents own the children The latest political debate started on Monday morning when Mr Christie noted that while he and his wife decided to have their children vaccinated that solution may not be best for all parents Its much more important I think what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official he said But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well So thats the balance that the government has to decide He continued I didnt say Im leaving people the option what Im saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns because no parent cares about anything more than they care about protecting their own childs health And so we have to have that conversation But that has to move and shift in my view from disease type Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others Despite being effectively eradicated in the US as recently as  a measles outbreak that started at the Disneyland amusement park in California has spread to  US states and infected at least  individuals The episode has many Americans   who citing religious beliefs or possible adverse health implications of scheduled vaccinations have opted to delay or skip vaccinations  despite repeated insistence by public health professionals that the risks are minimal Within a few hours of Mr Christies comments his press office attempted to clarify his remarks writing in   that the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated  The fires had been stoked however  and his remarks have been contrasted with US President Barack Obamas statement on Monday morning that the science supporting immunisations is pretty indisputable Weve looked at this again and again   on NBCs Today programme There is every reason to get vaccinated but there arent reasons to not Given that Mr Christie Mr Paul and Ms Clinton are considered likely candidates for president in  much of the debate is being cast in a political light  right versus left science versus theology authority versus doubt Slates Amanda Marcotte   rejecting scientific consensus an art that Republicans have perfected when it comes to climate change and evolution But more importantly the right is just a more comfortable home ideologically for antivaccination arguments Despite Marcottes contention the immunisation debate such as it is is difficult to break down on partisan lines Although she cites   that shows slightly more selfidentified conservatives support the nowdebunked link between autism and vaccines a liberal anticorporate naturalliving strain of antivaccination opinion is just as responsible for the   in the US as the conservative antigovernmentmandate view Republican consultant Rick Wilson   that Mr Christie is being wildly irresponsible in his statements Vaccination is one of the most consequential scientific and medical advances in the history of mankind   Im as libertarian as it comes but the social contract includes not letting your kids die of preventable diseases or spread them to others The increased attention to Mr Christies recent views have had other writers rehashing   by the governor in which he told a radio interviewer he didnt support mandating that children receive the flu vaccine and that parents who believe vaccines cause autism need a voice in these debates He also wrote a letter to antivaccination parents saying he stands by them in their fight for greater parental involvement in vaccination decisions that affect children They also point out that Mr Christies public health policies appear inconsistent as just last year he instituted a mandatory quarantine for a nurse who had returned from treating Ebola patients in Africa despite no evidence that she had contracted the disease Its easy to forget given Christies reputation as a nononsense pragmatist but he often finds himself at odds with the medical establishment and basic common sense on issues of health   the Daily Beasts Olivia Nuzzi PoliticusUSAs Justin Baragona   the New Jersey governor a crass politician  It appears he is thinking that he can possibly appeal to the libertarians and uppermiddleclass liberals who feel vaccinations are unnecessary a tool of big government responsible for autism or any other crackpot reason antivaxxers have given for not immunising their children he says At the same time Christie can tell conservatives his stance is due to an overall distrust of the federal government and scientists which always sits well with the right If Mr Christies past affiliation with the antivaccination movement and his recent comments are in fact a calculated way to position himself within the Republican primary electorate a   shows he may find pockets of support for his attempts to buck scientific authority On a host of different subjects the US public differs significantly in its views from members of the scientific community While  of US adults say that childhood vaccines should be required  of scientists support it Vaccines arent the only source of significant disagreement  on topics like climate change animal research pesticides nuclear power and offshore drilling the two groups differ by at least  On the issue of genetically modified foods  of scientists believe they are safe  a view supported by only  of the US public Public health officials and commentators on the left and the right have been quick to dismiss comments by Mr Paul and Mr Christie as dangerous But while the Earth is round and the sky is blue the Pew survey seems to indicate that coming down against mandatory vaccinations may not be the political suicide that   may think
