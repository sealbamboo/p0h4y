Americans may be living longer and even exercising a little more but we really are not much healthier than we were  years ago and we are still far behind other rich countries when it comes to our health researchers said Wednesday The biggest survey of US health in  years breaks down death disease and disability county by county  and makes some very unflattering comparisons to other countries Its a big comprehensive dive into what kills us and what makes us sick It finds that how healthy you are depends on where you live If you live in a rich area like San Francisco Colorado or the suburbs of Washington DC youre likely as healthy as the Swiss or Japanese If you live in Appalachia or the rural South youre likely to be as unhealthy as people in Algeria or Bangladesh Our biggest enemies are our own bad habits  poor diet smoking and obesity Theyre far more dangerous to our health than pollution or risks from radiation And although women used to be far healthier than men men are closing the gap fast the survey by Dr Christopher Murray of the University of Washington and colleagues finds Theres been a lot of progress in the past  years in improving life expectancy for men less progress for women Murray told NBC news There are some communities where both men and women have seen huge advances in life expectancy places like New York and San Francisco have seen really enormous strides in expanding lifespan he added US life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from  years in  to  years in  over the same period healthy life expectancy increased from  to  years the team writes in one of the reports published in the journal Population Health Metrics and in the Journal of the American Medical Association But Americans lost ground compared to people living in other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Among  OECD countries between  and  the US rank for the agestandardized death rate changed from th to th Murrays team wrote Murrays team looked at the biggest national health surveys with data on millions of Americans They broke it down    and then compared the numbers to other big surveys  In the highestperforming counties life expectancy rivaled countries with the highest life expectancy in the world such as Switzerland and Japan they wrote In the lowestperforming counties life expectancy was lower than the life expectancy of countries receiving foreign aid such as Algeria and Bangladesh The lowest life expectancies in the US remained around  years for females and below  for males between  and  There are places with the best life expectancy in the world in the US and there are places in Mississippi for example or West Virginia where life expectancies are in the mids for men and low s for women Thats about the same as a number of poor developing countries Murray says The United States spends more than the rest of the world on health care and leads the world in the quality and quantity of its health research but that doesnt add up to better health outcomes Murray said in a statement One place the US does better  treating some cancers  Fiveyear survival for breast cancer and colorectal cancer are higher in the US than in many OECD countries they wrote The biggest killers clogged arteries known medically as ischemic heart disease lung cancer stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and road accidents But the diseases that caused the most misery known in the lingo as disabilityadjusted life years are low back pain major depressive disorder other musculoskeletal disorders neck pain and anxiety disorders In fact Americans are more disabled now than they were  years ago the researchers found The gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy a measure of the expected number of healthy years that an individual loses to disabilityincreased from  to  years In other words individuals in the US are living longer but not necessarily in good health they concluded The United States spends the most per capita on healthcare across all countries lacks universal health coverage and lags behind other highincome countries for life expectancy and many other health outcome measures High costs with mediocre population health outcomes at the national level are compounded by marked disparities across communities socioeconomic groups and race and ethnicity groups One underlying cause is poor diet The most important dietary risks in the US are a diet low in fruits low in nuts and seeds high in sodium high in processed meats low in vegetables and high in transfats they wrote For the first time were saying that the composition of diet which is made up  different components things like fruits grains nuts seeds and other aspects of diet being analyzed is the biggest determinant of health in the US followed by smoking followed by obesity and then followed by high blood sugar and physical inactivity Murray told NBC news  So if you put all of those together theres huge potential to improve health in the US and in fact get ahead of other high income countries if we were to address these modifiable risks First Lady Michelle Obama said the report shows communities and policymakers need to help Americans eat better Were going to be working with food companies and restaurants who are offering more healthy options to families so that when they go into a restaurant they have some decent choices she said at an event at the White House for her Lets Move campaign But Dr Steven Woolf of Virginia Commonwealth University who chaired a National Academy of Sciences panel that  in January says its more complex than just bad habits Its unsophisticated to say its because we are not eating right Woolf said in a telephone interview There is a large contingent of Americans who react by saying this is a matter of personal responsibility To some extent thats true but there is much more about the way our lives are structured in the US Counties that score higher in terms of health have social services that support parents and better education outcomes Woolf argues And Jeff Levi of the Trust for Americas Health sees a telling pattern in the countybycounty breakdown of US health  Those distinctions are really about income and education level Levi told NBC News   OECD countries are spending more on education and income support than we do and that is what is helping to create this healthier environment he added We need to really try to get at the social and environmental causes of these issues and really focus on true prevention which is not managing in a clinical setting but creating the conditions where this doesnt happen in the first place Woolf says a lot has to do with public perception We are much more afraid of plane crashes and being struck by lightning and not afraid of the things that are far more likely to claim our lives he said The other reflex people have is to say social programs are important but we just cant afford it We have plenty of money for it he added If you look at how much money the United States spends on heath our budget for health exceeds that of every other country in the world
