As weve   theres a backlash brewing to sedentary office life as more people realize how   can do a body wrong I work at home and often sit in front of my computer doing research and writing So I thought Id give a treadmill desk a try I went about this in steps First I elevated my sitting desk to a standing desk For about a month I grew comfortable standing all day Then I added a discreet treadmill without handrails under my standing desk and voila  a treadmill desk Im into my second week now and walking at a pretty slow casual pace about  miles an hour When I first started I thought Id simply hop on the treadmill and be off walking all day while working But it turns out its really hard to walk talk think and concentrate  an obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic who   with the idea of the treadmill desk told me that my experience was pretty typical Theres a tendency to want to jump on the treadmill and walk for hours and hours a day he says Dont do that Certainly at the absolute maximum do halfhour on half an hour off for two to three hours a day Thats a relief Thats about what Im doing Levine says that since the s work spaces have been designed to minimize movement Its a culturally ingrained mindset he says which dominates much of our lives today You could literally spend your entire adult life from graduation to coffin entry without leaving your apartment without getting up he says Levine is on a mission to get any kind of movement into the workplace and the workday Hes consulted with a number of companies nationwide to help them do this The most popular activity by far he says is the walk and talk meeting Theyre generally shorter more productive and people dont fall asleep during walkandtalk meetings Take   a financial consulting firm based in Minneapolis The company has  treadmill desks and encourages walking meetings and a minibreakaway game  a mixture of pingpong tennis and a bit of squash Throughout the day employees rotate on and off the available treadmill desks Craig Dexheimer Salos director of operations and administration loves his Hes lost  pounds since he started using it If employees get distracted while walking he suggests they stop or slow down the treadmill A few years ago Salo took part in a Mayo Clinic study headed by Levine to see what happened when employees used treadmill desks The study was small  just  participants For six months they rotated on and off the desks walking on average about three hours a day Everyone lost weight And overall Dexheimer says health improved Total cholesterol decreased plasma triglycerides dropped on average  percent in total for all  participants Remarkable he says We didnt even go to a gym We just went to work And productivity didnt suffer In fact Dexheimer says during the six months of the study Salos revenues were the highest ever The environment he says was simply more dynamic Now this doesnt mean a treadmill desk or a game of pingpong is for everyone But even a little bit of activity is better than nothing says Catrine TudorLocke a researcher at the   Instead of sending email to a colleague two doors down try actually walking over to them she says As for me Im still getting used to my treadmill desk I can write emails read have phone conversations But I havent yet written a story while walking Levine and others say certain complicated or creative tasks are often still done best while sitting
