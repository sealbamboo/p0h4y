Seven mental health patients have killed themselves in England since  after being told there were no hospital beds for them the BBC has learned An investigation of coroners reports and NHS trust papers with the journal   found another patient denied a bed later killed his mother It comes as mental health beds are being cut in England  figures show more than  have gone since   The NHS England said spending on mental health was increasing in real terms The investigation by BBC News and Community Care has also revealed an email that a chief executive of a mental health trust wrote to NHS England in frustration this summer after one of her senior officials came to tell her that Yet again there were no mental health beds in London in either the NHS or private sector Wendy Wallace head of Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust bemoaned NHS Englands lack of interest in the problem She wrote I could not envisage a situation where all the acute beds in London were full and there was not even an investigation into the situation nor a plan of action The investigation established that since  seven people across England have taken their own lives having been told no beds were available They were In addition Peter Holboll from London admitted the manslaughter of his mother Tamara having been told no beds were available   A ninth person Amanda Vickers  from Cumbria died after being denied a bed in a crisis house a facility used to treat patients outside hospitals   Pauline Binch from Nottingham started to develop mental health problems in  The yearold took an overdose in June July August and September    Following the fourth attempt to take her life on  September her psychiatrist said that an inpatient admission was required and a request was sent to a bed manager   No bed was available between  and  September On  September a bed did become available but the trust could not contact Pauline and that evening the bed was given to another patient A bed was not found on   or  October    At  BST on  October Paulines body was discovered at her home   The investigation into her death concluded Bed managers were aware of the severity of risk in PBs case but with the exception of several hours on  Sept  could not find a bed to admit her to Her husband John told the BBC shed still be alive today if theyd found her a bed Last year   that  beds had been closed between April  and August  New figures revealed through freedom of information requests from  of Englands  mental health trusts show that since last August a further  beds have been cut   That means that since April  when there were  beds available a total of  beds have been cut  Other data from the trusts show that the wards that remain are overoccupied   Adult acute admission wards are running at an average monthly occupancy level of  for the past two years The Royal College of Psychiatrists says the occupancy level should be  It is possible for trusts to exceed  as they fill beds temporarily freedup when patients are allowed out for a short time although filling those beds runs the risk of no bed being available if the patient on leave has a relapse Ms Wallace said If you need admission to a mental health bed your need is very high Unless we get some attention unless we get some understanding of whats happening in the system and some resources to be able to deal with it it wont improve Much of the anger within the mental health system is directed towards NHS England which is accused by many of failing to understand or prioritise mental health  Last year they suggested to clinical commissioning groups who buy mental health services that they cut budgets to mental health trusts by a greater percentage than for physical health hospitals  The Department of Health and the care and support minister Norman Lamb MP are putting much hope for a change in mental health provision on the    their flagship policy for improving care  But just a month before a deadline for areas to sign up to the agreement just one third of areas have done so while just  have announced plans on how they will put it into practice   Mr Lamb said Weve made huge progress but we want to go further to make sure everyone gets the care they need and to ensure that mental health gets treated fairly in the allocation of resources We are going further than ever before to put mental health on a par with physical health  NHS Englands director for people with longterm conditions Dr Martin McShane said Spending on mental health is now going up in real terms after years when services were under real pressure  One result of the increase in spending is big falls in the number of people in mental health crisis ending up in police cells As we expand services patients are also able use NHSfunded beds in the independent sector  But thelong term solution is not just about beds or buildings as highlighted in Sir Stephen Bubbs recent report but about finding the right solution for each patient
