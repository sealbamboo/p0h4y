Are you still making fun of young women for talking like Valley Girls Do you assume that because their statements end in a hesitant rising quaver My name is Brittany  they are shallow scattered or uncertain Even that they sound  how to say this politely is there any way  intellectually your inferior Seriously For years sociologists and linguists have studied that lilt referring to it as uptalk or highrising intonation They found its presence in large pockets throughout the Englishspeaking world  Australia England New Zealand Some date it to the s others say it is centuries old In America it became popularized during the s as Valley Girl Speak presumably inspired by Frank Zappas hit  song   a derisive reference to the young white women of Californias San Fernando Valley who spoke it as their own dialect Films like Heathers and Clueless perpetuated and parodied the stereotype of the speech and its purported lifestyle  But scholars have found that the rising inflection can suggest a range of nuanced meanings in different geographical areas and conversational contexts Another myth busted its use is not exclusive to young women Now researchers at the University of California San Diego who wanted to learn more about when and how local speakers use uptalk have done a close acoustical analysis of  Southern Californians from diverse backgrounds ages  to  including  men Trading the derogatory label Valley Girl Speak for the relatively neutral SoCal English they found that both men and women often use uptalk although with some genderbased differences Men dont think they do it but they do said Amanda Ritchart a graduate student and coauthor of the project which was presented earlier this month at a   The researchers gave the speakers two tasks using a map to give directions to a listener and describing a sitcom clip they had just watched  Generally the women did use uptalk almost twice as often as men with their rises beginning later in a sentence and hitting higher pitches But even in making a simple declarative statement such as My appointment is at  oclock which a nonuptalker downtalker might end with a falling intonation the men and women in this group used rises with similar frequency When giving directions a nonuptalker would use a declarative sentence without a rising inflection But uptalkers did use rises as if they were implicitly asking the listener to confirm that they were being understood Go all the way to the right in the middle where it says Canyon Hills Both the men and women in the study used uptalk  percent of the time in these socalled confirming statements Uptalk the researchers found could also serve a strategic purpose through a technique known as floorholding in which the speaker anticipating an interruption by the listener tries to stave it off by using a rising tone at the end of a statement Floorholding is the vocal equivalent of holding up your palm as if to say Wait Im not finished  In the study women spoke with the floorholding rise nearly  percent of the time OK so go toward Warren pronounced as a highrising WaaREN Men used it only  percent of the time tending instead to maintain steady voices in a plateau Amalia Arvaniti a coauthor of the study who is now head of the English language and linguistics department at the University of Kent in England said It could indicate that young women were generally interrupted more than men and so its a defense mechanism  Because the research analyzed vocal patterns it did not address whether men are using uptalk because they picked it up from women Moreover linguists and sociologists disagree about the extent to which at least in Southern California it began as girltalk Women do appear to use it more than men although theres no hard proof for that Nor is there consensus about when men began using it though certainly in popular entertainment women have been ridiculed far more often than men for uptalking The first person I even noticed as an unusually frequent uptalker was one of my oldest sons male friends in  noted Mark Liberman a linguistics expert at the University of Pennsylvania He said this latest research offers a careful study of usage patterns among young Californians in San Diego in two welldefined contexts but in the main Im waiting for evidence that theres any real connection to Southern California or that things have changed in the past  years or so Researchers continue to puzzle over the myriad relationships between gender and speech Last year Thomas J Linneman a sociologist at The College of William and Mary studied  episodes of the television show Jeopardy noting that male and female contestants used uptalk over all  percent of the time That may be due in part to the shows requirement that quiz answers be presented in question form In a   he found that Men use uptalk more when surrounded by women contestants and when correcting a woman contestant after she makes an incorrect response He concluded The more successful a man is the less likely he is to use uptalk the more successful a woman is the more likely she is to use uptalk Dr Liberman of the University of Pennsylvania said that some studies suggest that uptalk has been used by the more powerful person in hierarchical exchanges such as those between employer and employee teacher and student or doctor and patient An office assistant for example would not be likely to say to the boss Are you following me on this Do you understand what Im saying In such instances uptalk rather than suggesting insecurity may in fact signal confidence paternalism coercion or faux conviviality Theres even the possibility that uptalk is now so widely used that its disdainful stereotype will disappear its intonations lingering as a kind of regional accent the California version of a Southern drawl  although some researchers note that American uptalkers are not confined to the West Coast Perhaps suggest scholars some negative perceptions of uptalk may be driven by generational divides Penelope Eckert a linguistics professor at Stanford wrote in an email Language and society change and a lot of these patterns that older people stigmatize sound perfectly natural and OK to younger people Ms Ritchart who is  grew up in Southern California and considers herself a native uptalker She heard her mother who was also raised in Southern California speak it though not her father who is from the Midwest One theory for the acceptance of uptalk is that a generation has grown up being comfortable with it I never thought people who were doing it were dumb because I do it too and Im not dumb Ms Ritchart said I am getting a PhD
