Medical entrepreneurs are remaking the emergency room experience Theyre pulling the emergency room out of the hospital and planting it in the strip mall Its called a   and some  of them have opened across the country in the past four years The trend is hot around Houston where there are already  freestanding ERs and  more in the works I think these emergency medical centers are springing up like Texas wildflowers in the springtime says   a health economist at Rice University in Houston Its really amazing Some of the new facilities are owned by hospitals but the majority are owned by forprofit companies Ho says they may offer excellent care but theyre also chasing profits They are usually set up in places where there are highincome patients who are wellinsured and who want to see someone quickly says Ho Theyre not being built in poor neighborhoods rural communities or areas with lots of uninsured people Patients like Lisa Boncler love how accessible they are She came to the   in the affluent Houston suburb of Atascocita to get stitches on her scalp after she gashed her head on a gate handle This is not the first time Ive been in here says Boncler who has a choice of six different ERs two based at hospitals and four freestanding like Texas Emergency Center Its always fast and I dont feel like Im picking up  germs The waiting room furnished with brown leather armchairs and a coffee station worthy of a spa is empty because patients are usually seen right away But Texas Emergency Center is a real emergency room Its licensed by the state and staffed around the clock by a doctor and a nurse Were a service to the community We give them back the most valuable thing time says Terri Hardy who is chief of clinical operations for Texas Emergency Center They come here and we see them immediately We perform the same labs the same Xrays the same CAT scans the same ultrasounds  Its convenience Freestanding ERs can make a lot of money because they charge ER prices A visit that might have cost  at an urgentcare center can cost four or five times as much at an ER Bills are just like at the hospital ER  you pay for the treatment the doctors fee and something called a facility fee That fee is for all the overhead including expensive equipment like the CAT scanner and the lab Patients are sometimes shocked when they get the bill Steve Henderson  lives in Spring a suburb north of Houston He woke up one morning in March with back spasms so bad he could barely walk He dragged himself to his car and drove to what he thought was an urgentcare facility The sign did say emergency but it just didnt look like an ER My idea of an emergency room is attached to a hospital with crash carts and cardiac arrest and car wreck victims and all that stuff he says He says the place he went looked like your friendly neighborhood docinabox in a shopping center with a doughnut shop across the street Henderson got a shot in his back a prescription and later a bill for    of that for the facility fee I knew thered be some kind of fee for this place But  for just walking in the door is outrageous says Henderson who is insured but hadnt met his deductible He was on the hook for the whole fee Similar consumer complaints can be found online and on file at the Better Business Bureau Insurance companies are also pushing back By law they must cover emergency room visits even if the ER isnt in their network For these freestanding ERs weve seen our dollars and visits just about double over the past year says Shara McClure a vice president for   While ER is a choice its a highcost choice and its one that can cost five to seven times more than a typical office visit But standaloneER executives emphasize they treat real emergencies all the time The problem with urgent care is if youre having something serious you go there and they either call  or they send you to the emergency department says Brian Orsak cofounder of   which has three locations in Houston Were equipped basically to handle anything But that level of care has a price to the entire health care system says economist Ho at a time when the government  and insurers  are trying to control those costs Some states have tougher regulations for freestanding ERs like requiring them to be part of a hospital system And some insurance companies have sued over the facility fees or persuaded the ERs to sign contracts and accept lower payments For now its up to the medical consumer to figure out where to go for the right level of care at the right price
