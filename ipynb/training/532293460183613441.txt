Jeffrey Craig Hopper is a probate attorney and Little League coach in Austin Texas so he knows all about following the rules Still accidents happen Last June on the Little League field an errant baseball smashed into his face His wife Jennifer remembers rushing to the field His eye was swollen shut enough that we werent sure if he could see she says Even in that moment of panic Jennifer Hopper realized that there are rules when it comes to using health insurance that can hugely influence the size of the medical bill Care providers who are in network she knew cost much less so she made absolutely sure to drive Jeffrey to the emergency room of a hospital in Austin that is part of their insurance network That sounds straightforward but as the couple soon learned it doesnt always work out that way  some patients still get slapped with big bills even when they try to play by the rules In the end Jeffrey was OK  the ball broke some facial bones around his eye but they healed and his vision was fine Jennifer however was surprised by what happened next After shed already settled with the hospital paying the copayments for the ER the ER doctor sent the couple a separate bill for more than  It felt kind of random she says How do I know whos going to charge me and whos not going to Like many patients Hopper assumed that if she went to a hospital that the insurance company had designated as being within her network the doctors who work there would also of course be in the network But thats not necessarily true Emergency room doctors radiologists and anesthesiologists often dont work for the hospital They work for themselves often in large practice groups and its up to them to sign their own deals with insurance companies Many of them dont In those situations the doctors can bill the patient for whatever the insurance company wouldnt cover  because the coverage took place within the approved hospital network but outside the approved network   I couldnt let that go  it just felt wrong Hopper says because there was no way out There was obviously no way we could have avoided the situation given our emergency The Center for Public Policy Priorities recently analyzed ER billing by the three biggest insurers in Texas  Humana Blue Cross and United Healthcare The   found that in more than half of Humanas Texas hospitals none of the ER doctors who see patients there were within Humanas network The same was true at just under half the Texas hospitals that take United Healthcare insurance and at about a fifth of those that take Blue Cross  a health policy analyst and the reports author says that sort of arrangement is unfair to patients No other consumer services are sold to us this way she says It would be like going into a restaurant and ordering a meal and then getting a bill from the waiter and from the restaurant separately and the cook separately and the busboy separately And some of them will negotiate with you on the price and some of them will accept coupons and the others dont Texas insurers have said they would like emergency room doctors to join their networks but cant force them to The ER doctors   that insurance companies often dont pay them enough even if they do join the network The economics of ERs are complex explains   president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians In an emergency department we see everyone and were not even legally allowed to ask if theyre going to pay their bill Moskow says Large numbers of people pay nothing There is a   in Texas for some of these outofnetwork bills but its only for certain types of insurance and for certain situations Some other states have tried to tackle the problem In California ER doctors arent allowed to send a separate bill to HMO patients In New York a newly passed law requires outofnetwork doctors and insurers to hash out payment on their own and leave patients out of it Texas legislators have held hearings on this issue recently but the discussions havent yet led to any new regulations Jennifer Hopper says she spent weeks appealing her bill going back and forth between the doctors and the insurance carrier Eventually she filed a complaint with state regulators After that she says the bill simply disappeared Pogue says the typical advice  for patients to do their homework ahead of time and know whos in their network and who isnt  isnt always possible especially in the middle of an emergency If youre wheeled into the emergency room door you cant ask the emergency room physician who runs up to stabilize you Are you in network or out of network That physician needs to be concentrating at that point on giving you lifesaving care not rattling off the list of insurance companies that he or she contracts with she says Jennifer Hopper tried to do her homework by figuring out where to go for a possible future ER visit Online she searched her health plan to find ER doctors who were actually in her insurance plans network But she found fewer than five at the hospitals her plan uses in Austin She doubts the odds of getting those doctors the next time she or a family member needs care So the reality she says is that all the transparency in the world doesnt change the fact that  knowing everything  I could not be sure I would get a different outcome
