It might not exactly be doctors orders but it made perfect sense to Josh Sweeney If you hit somebody you feel a lot better he says making his way off the ice from a grueling practice with the US Paralympic Sled Hockey team  a sport also known as murder ball on ice Sled hockey might be the fastest sport in the Paralympics players strap on to a tiny sled perched a few inches off the ice balanced on one doublerunner skate They use two short sticks like ski poles to fly across the ice Then the sticks flip around with a hockey blade on the tip Players can switch the puck quickly between left and right and shoot from either side The Paralympics movement started with disabled veterans after World War II Today there are many veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan in Sochi with the US team Sweeney is one of them He lost both of his legs to a bomb in Afghanistan where he served as a Marine in  Sports were far from his mind as he began months of rehab at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio Texas Youre kind of in survival mode You dont think What am I going to be able to do  Sweeney says Its really just Am I going to be able to get back up and feed myself and take care of myself  Once he realized his life wasnt over Sweeney tried a few adaptive sports Hed played hockey in high school but had never heard of sled hockey When he tried it he was hooked especially on the highspeed shoulder checking thats a big part of the sport When I first got out there the hitting  it was a little scary because you dont really know how to take it Sweeney says But at the same time Id been in a hospital for so long and Id been cooped up doing rehab  I was ready to take out some frustration Sweeney learned about the sport by watching another veteran Rico Roman who has been on the US team for three years He lost his left leg to a bomb blast during his third deployment to Iraq with the Army in  Though Roman had barely ever been on ice before the injury he soon started playing sled hockey with the San Antonio Rampage a sled hockey team based near the Brooke Army hospital Its just a blast out there Roman says I love the toughness the hitting I love the speed of the game I love the lingo  saucing the pass nasty dangles  these are all terms only a hockey player would know The team competing in Sochi Russia this year includes an allveteran line with Josh Sweeney Rico Roman and Paul Schaus as well as activeduty soldier Jen Lee in goal And the pressures on four years ago the US took gold in the Vancouver Paralympics and theyre hoping to defend the title Either way Sweeney  who had never even heard of the Paralympics before he started playing sled hockey  says getting on the ice has been a huge part of his recovery It just made me feel so good he says I was just in the moment I forget about everything else in life  I was just playing hockey again
