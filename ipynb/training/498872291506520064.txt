When statins first came into wide use warnings about possible liver damage were common and some patients on the cholesterollowering drugs have their liver function monitored Now a study has found that the risk was probably exaggerated Of  cases of druginduced liver injury from  to  in a registry maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases there were  cases with injury because of statins Nine patients were hospitalized four had evidence of liver failure and one died The   Lipitor Lescol Mevacor Pravachol Crestor and Zocor were the medicines involved at rates approximating their use in the United States The injuries were mostly mild to moderate in their severity and were reversed quickly once the treatment was stopped The patient who died had alcoholic liver disease which probably contributed to his death Statins are a remarkably safe category of medicines and the benefits far outweigh the risks said the lead author Dr Mark W Russo a professor of medicine at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte NC He added that although a routine blood test would usually include liver tests anyway there is no need for people on statins to have a test for the sole purpose of monitoring liver function
