The new bird flu in China has come with a long list of questions Are the  cases   so far just the tip of a larger outbreak Why does the virus cause mild symptoms in some people and severe pneumonia in others Perhaps the most critical question is also the simplest How do people catch the bug The   clearly infects birds Health workers have detected it in chickens ducks and pigeons But many people who have gotten sick didnt came near birds the World Health Organization said Wednesday A scientist at the China Disease Prevention and Control Centre said that nearly  percent of patients with HN dont have a clear history of poultry exposure   Tuesday Yet theres still little evidence that the virus can easily jump between people Weve seen four instances that could be humantohuman transmission among very close contacts WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl tells Shots Even in these cases the transmission could be from a common environmental source If it was humantohuman transmission it wasnt sustained So whats fueling the outbreak It might be other animals It might be that the case histories they have arent complete enough It could be humantohuman transmission Hartl says It may even be dust at market Health workers have detected the virus in samples from the environment in several Shanghai markets the World Organization for Animal Health   in early April The group identified  HN outbreaks in birds around China But HN doesnt make birds sick So detecting the virus in animals has been like finding a needle in a Chinasized haystack Something like  to  birds have been tested and only  have come back positive  Hartl says Those come from poultry duck and pigeons Most of the human HN cases have occurred in Shanghai or the surrounding region But there have been two cases in Beijing which is nearly  miles away from Shanghai Most people infected have been hospitalized with severe respiratory problems and  have died But Hartl says there have been a handful of mild cases At least one person wasnt hospitalized And one boy in Beijing tested positive for the virus but showed no symptoms at all Nailing down where the virus comes from and how it moves around seems to be at the top of the WHOs todo list It has a team currently headed to China to help the government do just that Hartl says If we want to control this virus he says we need to know where it lives and how its transmitted
