During marathons women pace themselves more evenly than male competitors do according to a  study of thousands of racers The results provide unexpected insights into some of the physical and emotional differences between male and female runners and also how both genders might improve their race times by noting how the other one runs  Anyone who has competed in or seen a marathon knows that maintaining a steady speed throughout the  miles is advisable People who start the race at a fast pace generally have to slow and even walk or zombie shuffle as the race goes on  A few small studies and many anecdotal observations had suggested that men were more apt than women to wind up slowing But no largescale examination of marathon racers had confirmed that  So for the new study which was   researchers at Marquette University in Milwaukee the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn and Grand Valley State University in Allendale Mich began by gathering data about the finishers at  marathons The races included  prominent ones such as the Chicago and Disney marathons and smaller events Some were conducted in warm weather others in chilly conditions with terrain ranging from hilly to pancakeflat  The researchers wound up with information about  marathon participants almost  percent of them women The data covered all adult age groups and a wide range of finishing times  They then compared each runners time at the midpoint of his or her race with his or her time at the finish a simple method of broadly determining pace If someone covers the second half of a race in about the same time as the first then his or her pace is relatively even with little slowing Only rarely does someone speed up in the second half of a race running what is known as a negative split As it turned out men slowed significantly more than women racers did In aggregate men covered the second half of the marathon almost  percent slower than they ran the first half Women as a group were about  percent slower in the second half  Burrowing deeper into the data the scientists categorized runners as having slowed markedly if their secondhalf times were at least  percent slower than their firsthalf splits In concrete terms a racer covering the first half of the course in two hours and the second in  hours  minutes or more would have slowed markedly  Far more men than women fell into the markedly slower category with about  percent of the male finishers qualifying versus  percent of the women This disparity in race pacing held true in all age groups and finishing times the researchers found even among the fastest runners The difference however was most pronounced at the back of the pack There female runners were much more likely than men to steadily maintain the same less hurried pace throughout Wondering to what extent experience might affect the runners pacing the researchers next used a public database to gather the racing histories of  of the runners Using this data to adjust for marathon experience the researchers  found that men however many marathons they had completed were still more likely than equally experienced women to slow during the second half of a race  The study was not designed to determine why men more frequently fade during marathons But the reasons are likely to be physiological and psychological said Sandra Hunter a professor of exercise science at Marquette University and the senior author of the study We know that at any given exercise intensity men will burn a greater percentage of carbohydrates for fuel than women Dr Hunter said and women will use more fat Our bodies male and female contain considerably more fat than stored carbohydrates So men typically run out of fuel and bonk or hit the wall earlier than women do Dr Hunter says  They are also more prone psychologically to adopt what Dr Hunter terms a risky strategy in their early pacing They start out fast and just hope they can hold on she says  Interestingly she continues that strategy can sometimes pay off in a swifter finishing time Its not necessarily a bad thing to push yourself at the start of a marathon she says if you have not catastrophically overestimated your capabilities  Similarly she points out an evenly paced race is not a wellpaced one if you run slower than you were capable of running  The message of the study then would seem to be that an approach to marathon pacing that borrows something from men and women might be ideal  Maybe go a bit harder than you think you can in training Dr Hunter said aiming to calibrate what your actual fastest  sustainable pace is Then stick with it during the event even if your training partners tear away like rabbits at the start Youll reel them in
