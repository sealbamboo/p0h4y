Ebola is threatening to reverse years of educational progress in West Africa The virus has kept school closed for months in a part of the world where literacy rates are low and school systems are only now recovering from years of civil war In Liberia many children have been put to work while schools are closed and Ebola is hurting the economy says   a communication specialist at UNICEF The fear now he says is that many of these children will never return to school The risk is especially high for girls who until recently received much less schooling than boys Duvillier says Families may be tempted to keep the eldest girl at home to help them or to wash clothes for the neighbors he says We dont want those girls to drop out of school because of Ebola The school closures have been a challenge even for families with the resources to supervise and educate their children on their own Linda BarrolleSaygbe who works for the   wanted to hire a tutor to work with her two daughters and other children who live in her compound about an hour from Monrovia She abandoned the idea because of a government ban on gatherings of people  and because of her own fears that the classes might put her daughters at risk of getting Ebola Instead BarrolleSaygbe and her husband are having the girls study for two hours a day They dont go out she says The only place we go is church Its very sad says BarrolleSaygbes daughter Sharon who is  and would have been a high school senior this year The school closures will delay her plans to go to college and study information technology she says Sharons younger sister Issabelle who is  and wants to be a journalist says she misses her teachers and friends and having fun Closing schools was probably necessary to stop the spread of Ebola BarrolleSaygbe says But she worries now that her daughters could lose an entire year of education The time is too long And if they are not doing anything they will fall way way back she says Children from less affluent families face much more serious risks Duvillier says The kids play everywhere he says We dont know where they go Theyre roaming and actually its increasing the risk of Ebola because we never know if they may enter the home and not wash their hands The longer schools in West Africa remain closed the greater the risk that kids will drop out But schools cant reopen until they are sure students will be safe from Ebola Duvillier says That means training teachers how to prevent infections and installing handwashing stations at the entrance of every school Both of those simple requirements represent a very big logistical challenge Duvillier says and could take weeks or months During Liberias civil war which ended in  some children missed years of school And literacy rates plummeted The challenge now is to make sure Ebola does not have a similar effect Duvillier says
