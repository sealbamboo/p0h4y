Watching participants in   and halfpipe skiing and snowboarding flip curl cartwheel and otherwise contort themselves in the air during the Winter Olympics competition many of us have probably wondered not only how the athletes managed to perform such feats but also why Helpfully   of the genetics of risktaking intimates that their behavior may be motivated at least in part by their DNA For some time scientists and many parents have suspected that certain children are born needing greater physical stimulation than others suggesting that sensation seeking as this urge is known in psychological terms has a genetic component A thoughtprovoking   for instance concluded that risktaking behavior was shared by the pairs to a much greater extent than could be accounted for solely by environmental factors If one twin sought out risks the other was likely to do so as well But finding which genes or more specifically which tiny snippets of DNA within genes might be influencing the desire to huck oneself off of a snowcovered slope has proven to be troublesome In recent years scientists zeroed in on various sections of genes that affect the brains levels of or response to the neurotransmitter dopamine a substance that is known to influence our feelings of pleasure reward and gratification People who engage in and enjoy extreme daredevil conduct researchers presumed would likely process dopamine differently than those of us content to watch But the results of some early genetic studies comparing dopaminerelated portions of genes with sensation seeking were inconsistent Some found that people with certain variations within genes including a gene called DRD that is believed to be closely involved in the development and function of dopamine receptors in our brain gravitated toward risky behavior Others though found no such links But most of these studies focused on socalled deviant risktaking such as gambling and drug addiction Cynthia Thomson then a graduate student in the exercise physiology department at the University of British Columbia wondered whether these past studies might have been looking at the wrong activities and if it wouldnt be more telling to examine riskseeking in sports like skiing and snowboarding that allow for a broad range of styles from sedate and cautious my approach to hurtling and occasionally airborne To find out she first developed a questionnaire specifically related to onslope behavior which asked questions about how often fast and recklessly someone schussed or rode Did they leap from cliffs Or did they stick to blue intermediate runs Then she visited several of the large resorts dotting British Columbia and approached patrons between the ages of  and  asking them to fill out her questionnaire as well as a second standard personality questionnaire A high combined score on these tests would indicate a strong tendency to embrace risks The volunteers also provided a cheek swab for DNA typing Returning to her lab she began quantifying variations within the volunteers DRD genes Focusing on a single tiny section of the gene she found that skiers and riders who harbored a particular variant of DNA coding there were much more likely to score high on the tests of risktaking Because the number of volunteers in this experiment was small only  men and women Dr Thomson who is now a teaching fellow at Quest University Canada went back to the mountains and recruited an additional  participants And again in this expanded group she found the same association between the variation of the DRD gene and a willingness to take risks on the slopes The variants overall effect was slight explaining only about  percent of the difference in behavior between risk takers and the risk averse but was statistically significant and remained intact even when Dr Thomson and her colleagues controlled for gender and sport expertise In essence the findings suggest that some people might have an innate inherited need to turn to risky activities to reach their optimal level of arousal Dr Thomson said even if their parents are quiet respectable types The DNA from each parent can contain different portions of the variant Dr Thomson said which can combine in the child to create a slopestyle medalist Given no healthy outlets for their sensation seeking such individuals might turn to more problematic behaviors like gambling or drugs Dr Thomson said emphasizing that this idea is speculative and that no single isolated aspect of our genetics will ever fully explain why we act as we do But if you have a yearold who performs back flips off the couch she said you might consider directing him or her to freestyle skiing or gymnastics classes rather than say curling
