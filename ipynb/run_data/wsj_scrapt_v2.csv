|The decision by Express Scripts to make the AbbVie hepatitis C treatment the exclusive option for patients with the most common type of the virus caused a ruckus on Wall Street, although the reaction among some doctors and patient advocates was mixed. For Gilead Sciences, the market leader in hepatitis C drugs, the move by the big pharmacy benefits manager was the proverbial bitter pill. Gilead shares plunged 14% to $92.90, wiping out more than $20 billion in market capitalization over expectations of a big hit to sales.. Ballparking the hepatitis C market, however, can be tricky, given the different forms of the disease, the recommended durations for the competing treatments and, most of all, the willingness of physicians to prescribe one drug instead of another. So we spoke to doctors, patient advocates and other drug-benefit providers to get their takes.

Now, of course, that familiar routine of meetings and deadlines and what-not has returned. As always, we are coping with a needed cup or three of stimulation. Our flavor today is Blueberry Cobbler, a nice treat. Please feel free to join us. We don’t mind drinking alone, but a little camaraderie now and then can be a good thing.

|In a setback to Actavis, a federal court judge has issued a preliminary injunction that prevents the drug maker from pulling an older version of its Namenda medication for Alzheimer’s from pharmacy shelves. The ruling comes three months after the New York state attorney general filed a lawsuit alleging Actavis violated antitrust law by planning to prematurely end sales of the drug to force patients to switch to a newer version.. The lawsuit was filed shortly after Forest Laboratories, which is now owned by Actavis, halted sales of its twice-a-day version of Namenda. The patent on the older drug expires next year, while the patent on the newer Namenda XR, a once-a-day pill, doesn’t expire until 2025.

|Given the devastating consequences of Alzheimer’s and the difficulties that some drug makers have encountered trying to develop treatments, the slightest bit of positive data is sometimes greeted with outsized enthusiasm. And this is why positive interim results from an early-stage study of a Biogen Idec medication caused its stock to rise 6% yesterday.. Just the same, the report was met with caution, underlying an ongoing debate about drugs that attack amyloid plaques in the brain. The study is testing the drug against a placebo in 200 patients with early forms of Alzheimer’s. Interim results showed a drop in beta amyloid levels in the brain and a “statistically significant effect on cognition” after 54 weeks of treatment.

|A controversial new rule for updating generic drug labeling that the FDA was expected to finalize next month will not be published until the fall of 2015, an agency spokeswoman says. The rule, which the FDA proposed last year, would allow generic drug makers to independently update safety warnings, something that only brand-name drug makers can currently do before receiving FDA permission.. The agency proposed the rule in response to a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision that federal law does not permit generic drug makers to make such changes independently and, therefore, they should not be held accountable for a failure to warn against a risk. The contentious nature of the debate – generic drug makers fear litigation while consumer advocates say patient safety is at risk – is apparently the reason for the delay.|Tue Nov 18 14:27:12 +0000 2014||RT @pharmalot: FDA delays final rule on allowing #generic drug makers to update product labeling..  #pharma #FDA|5.347144431257846e+17|http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/11/18/fda-delays-final-rule-on-allowing-generic-drug-makers-to-update-labels/

|In a bid to save his job, Sanofi chief executive Chris Viehbacher last month wrote a letter to the board of directors to explain why it would be a bad idea to replace him. Viehbacher sent the letter in response to what he called “rumors” about board interest in letting him go. The letter followed growing tension with some directors over various decisions he has taken. The most recent tension reportedly occurred over his plan to sell about $8 billion in drugs, a move that was reportedly was not conveyed to the board.. For its part, the drug maker has only said that “from time to time, Sanofi’s board meets in non-executive sessions to discuss a wide range of issues.” In comments today, Viehbacher says succession issues were not on the agenda at a regularly scheduled board meeting yesterday, but did not otherwise mention the letter. “You have seen the transformation of the company over the past six years. I’m proud of that track record.”|Tue Oct 28 14:54:08 +0000 2014||RT @pharmalot: Sanofi CEO dismisses talk of his departure, but questions remain.. will he stay or will he go?  #pharm�|5.2711107587211264e+17|http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/10/28/sanofi-ceo-dismisses-rumors-about-his-departure-but-questions-remain/

But what about you? Anything special planned? How about a day at the races or a night at the movies? You could take a jaunt in the countryside or simply spend time with close personal friends. Well, whatever you do, have a grand time, but be safe. See you soon….

|We did not see big changes in employer-based coverage in the Kaiser-HRET annual .  released last week. Mostly this is good news, particularly on the cost side where premiums increased just 3%.. But one long-term trend that is not so good is how this market works for firms with relatively large shares of lower-wage workers (which we define as firms where at least 35% of employees earn less than $23,000). These low-wage firms often do not offer health benefits at all. And, as the chart below shows, when they do offer coverage, it has lower premiums on average (likely meaning skimpier coverage) and requires workers to pay more for it.

|Investors may want to pay close attention to the anti-trust lawsuit filed by the New York State Attorney General, who alleges that Actavis is not playing fair by planning to prematurely end sales of its Alzheimer’s drug in order to force patients to switch to a newer version. The tactic is known in the pharmaceutical industry as forced switching or product hopping.. So far, Actavis has not commented on the charges, but analysts say this is a decided negative and the drug maker ought to consider postponing the switch in order to defuse criticism. Meanwhile, though, there is the risk that the litigation may prevent Actavis from making the switch. For now, though, the drug maker intends to proceed with moving patients to its newer Namenda XR this fall as planned.|Wed Sep 17 16:15:00 +0000 2014||RT @pharmalot: What Will the Antitrust Lawsuit Mean for Actavis? read the lawsuit &amp; implications here  #pharma $ACT #�|5.122735245356155e+17|http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/09/17/what-will-the-ny-ag-anti-trust-lawsuit-mean-for-actavis-read-here/

Observers are split, with some emphasizing the law’s decline as a hot political issue and others its staying power as a rallying cry for the right, and a few suggesting that the ACA may emerge as an issue Democrats want to run on.. Each of these positions may be at least partly right. Obamacare has cooled as an issue now that there isn’t an obvious controversy, such as last fall’s website debacle, to occupy the front pages. But the law, now a more conventional Republican talking point than an outsize rallying cry, is still useful to some Republican candidates as a tool to motivate their anti-Obama base.

|The $84,000 per patient cost for the Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment has caused a national uproar amid an intensifying debate among lawmakers, insurers and economists about the value of expensive medicines to society at large. The dilemma caused by Sovaldi, however, is also forcing state Medicaid programs to make hard choices.. In Illinois, for instance, officials recently instituted a new set of 25 stringent criteria for using Sovaldi, which include treating only those patients with the most advanced stage of liver disease and limiting treatment for those with a history of drug use and alcohol abuse. We spoke with Arvind Goyal, medical director for the Illinois Department of Health Care and Family Services, about the process.

|While the takeover war between Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Allergan is necessarily devoted to swaying investor sentiment, there is another key constituency to consider – physicians. After all, doctors represent another type of battleground for drug makers, since their prescribing decisions so readily affect pharmaceutical fortunes. So how might these treasured holders of prescribing pads react if Valeant succeeds in buying Allergan?. As it turns out, a sizeable portion of them have a dour view of the deal. A survey of 100 dermatologists and plastic surgeons – those who use Botox, line fillers and breast implants – finds that 44% will consider shifting business away from the company if the merger and cost-cuts go through.|Thu Jul 24 14:59:52 +0000 2014||RT @stefaniei: If Valeant buys Allergan, many docs would consider shifting their business: Sanford Bernstein survey. �|4.923232859807048e+17|http://on.wsj.com/1nEjaJD

The issue has becoming increasingly worrisome amid a growing tally of retracted medical journal articles – a 19-fold increase from 2001 to 2010, although the rate dropped to 11-fold when repeat offenders were excluded, according to a study in PLOS One. And fraud accounted for 44 percent of all retracted papers, according to an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.. there is little debate that research fraud can have disturbing public health consequences, but what, if anything should be done about the researchers who commit most the serious infractions, such as fabricating or falsifying data? A researcher may lose a job or stature, but should there be more serious consequences, such as criminal liability?|Wed Jul 16 13:25:53 +0000 2014||RT @pharmalot: Should research fraud be a crime? read the point-counterpoint &amp; take our reader poll here  #pharma #fr�|4.8940052914847744e+17|http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/07/16/should-research-fraud-be-a-crime-a-reader-poll/

|Hello, everyone, and nice to see you again. We have returned our civic duty just in time for our weekly ritual – daydreaming about weekend plans.  Our agenda is, as usual, rather modest. We hope to spend ‘quality time’ with one or more short people, tidy up around the castle and take a nap or two. And you? Anything interesting planned? This is, of course, a lovely time of year to enjoy the great outdoors, so perhaps a sojourn to a beach or lake is in order. Or taking a long walk can be good for the soul. And then there is that upcoming soccer match to watch. Well, whatever you do, have a grand time, but be safe. See you soon…. Meanwhile, Shire is hearing from its shareholders by way of letters, telephone calls and meetings with its chairwoman about holding talks with AbbVie. Sarepta Therapeutics released study results of its drug for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy and these suggested less of a decline in walking ability from previous studies, sending its stock plunging.

|Dublin-based Shire PLC, a specialist in drugs to treat attention-deficit disorder and rare diseases, has rejected a £27.2 billion ($46.35 billion) takeover bid from U.S. rival AbbVie Inc., in the latest move by a U.S. company to pursue a deal for a company with a lower tax rate.. Shire, which is tax-resident in Ireland, said in a statement Friday the proposal “fundamentally undervalued the company and its prospects.”  The proposal comes amid a wave of interest in such so-called tax-inversion deals, most prominently Pfizer Inc.’s failed $120 billion attempt to buy AstraZeneca PLC, which ended last month. Similarly, U.S. medical-device company Medtronic Inc. on Sunday agreed to buy the U.K.’s Covidien PLC for $42.9 billion, also in part to lower its tax rate.. AbbVie can always come back with a fresh offer, and other suitors may emerge. But for now, Shire is staying solo.

|Late last month, the European Medicines Agency circulated a long-awaited draft policy on disclosure of clinical trial data by drug makers. Transparency has been a contentious topic following scandals over safety or effectiveness data that was not publicly shared. Initially, the EMA committed to ensuring data is accessible in ways that are easily analyzed and indicated data would not be considered confidential commercial information, which drug makers cite as a key reason for limiting access.. Now, though, the EMA is being accused of backtracking. The proposed policy, which will be voted on June 12, would not allow anyone to do more than view clinical study reports, which collect and summarize trial data, on computer screens. And some information, including details of trial designs and study results, can be redacted if a drug maker believes the information is commercially confidential.|Wed Jun 04 19:05:53 +0000 2014||RT @stefaniei: A watchdog's point of view on the Europe Medicines Agency's shift on data transparency.  via @pharmalot|4.7426580216286e+17|http://on.wsj.com/TbhIld

That means that most people buying in the exchanges won’t pay much even if their premium cost goes up significantly.|Tue May 13 13:29:11 +0000 2014||RT @TomBurtonWSJ: Many ACA premium rises won't hit individuals because of federal subsidies. @WSJWashington |4.662085373169664e+17|http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/05/12/the-next-big-health-care-issue/

|For Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, the drug company’s nearly .  is like going back to the future.. Since 2000, Pfizer has relied on three huge mergers to bolster its top line, plug holes in its product portfolio and appease investors. But those deals—in which Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and then Wyeth—mostly bought time as the drug maker cut costs, narrowed its R&D focus and then began raising its dividend.. Since being promoted to CEO three years ago, though, Mr. Read repeatedly has promoted the idea of splitting the drug maker into three separate units and pooh-poohed the notion that huge deals would be pursued in order to chase revenue.

For example, while only one in 10 clinical trials run by drug makers have recruited participants through social media channels, the majority have yet to try it. Why? Concerns range from protecting patient privacy to equally sticky issues such as patients who publicly distort adverse event experiences or introduce research bias by sharing treatment information online with others.. “Like it or not, social media communities as a forum for interaction and engagement are here to stay,” says Ken Getz, the director of sponsored research programs at the Tufts University Center for the Study of Drug Development, which queried 17 drug makers and three contract research organizations..

It tells us the final days of enrollment attracted a surge of consumers and that the sometimes-panicked rush by the Obama administration to fix HealthCare.gov after a disastrous launch largely paid off..

|Over the past few years, the pharmaceutical industry has been embroiled in controversy over access to clinical trial data. At issue is the ability for researchers to independently verify study results and, consequently, improve patient treatments that can lead to better health and lower costs.. This sentiment has accelerated in light of various safety scandals that revealed data for some drugs was never fully published or disclosed. In response, a few drug makers – including GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson – have recently proposed differing plans for providing access, although the extent to which their efforts will assuage concerns remains to be seen.. We spoke with Peter Doshi, an assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and an associate editor at the British Medical Journal, who has been at the forefront of a campaign to prod drug makers to move faster..

A .  published in the journal Ergonomics found that workers who share open spaces with multiple colleagues are more likely to take short-term sick leaves than those who enjoy the privacy of their own office.. Researcher and architect Christina Bodin Danielsson and three colleagues at Stockholm University studied 1,852 employees working in seven different types of offices in Sweden. The layouts ranged from private offices to rooms housing two to three people to open plan layouts with more than 24 people. They also looked at employees working in what they dub “. ,” where there are no assigned workstations.. Workers were asked to report the number of short sick leave spells – defined as a week or less – they’d taken over the past year as well as the number of long spells, or periods longer than a week.
