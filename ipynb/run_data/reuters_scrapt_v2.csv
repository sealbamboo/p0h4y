Alex Dobuzinskis|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Authorities in Los Angeles have shuttered 500 medical marijuana dispensaries since residents voted two years ago to cap the number of pot shops in the city at about 130, officials said on Thursday. . City Attorney Mike Feuer told reporters hundreds of the illegal businesses still operate, highlighting the challenges of reining in the dispensaries in Los Angeles, which is widely believed to have more pot shops than any U.S. metropolis. . To achieve the closures, Los Angeles officials have filed criminal and civil cases against some dispensary owners, and have sent letters threatening legal action against landlords who lease space to dispensaries, officials said. . The medical cannabis shops opened in the years after a vote by California residents in 1996 to permit medicinal use of the drug, which remains banned under federal law.  . Twenty-three U.S. states allow medical pot, while four states and the District of Columbia have approved recreational marijuana use by adults. . Efforts to control the number of dispensaries in Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest city, have at times been compared with a game of whack-a-mole, as the owners of some shops move their businesses to escape enforcement. . The dispensaries, which are usually identified by a green medical cross posted on a storefront, have long drawn complaints from neighbors upset about the pungent smell and the risk of minors getting marijuana from dispensary customers.   . But Feuer said the number of complaints has fallen over the last two years, in what he said was a sign the crackdown by his office is working. He declined to give an exact estimate of how many dispensaries still exist.     . “While we have succeeded in a remarkable way up to this point, we are far from through,” Feuer told a news conference. . Los Angeles residents voted in 2013 to cap the number of dispensaries at about 130, or roughly as many as registered with the city in 2007 when city leaders first tried to limit their numbers. . Under California’s rules, the dispensaries cannot be located near schools, and must follow other regulations such as not having illuminated signs visible at night.   . Estimates for the number of dispensaries currently operating in the city have varied widely. . A survey last September by the University of California, Los Angeles, found at least 410 in operation, said Bridget Freisthler, a professor of social welfare at the school. |Thu Apr 09 21:40:16 +0000 2015||Los Angeles closes 500 medical marijuana shops, but hundreds remain |5.862825039813755e+17|http://reut.rs/1CvkXmm
|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday reduced its forecasts for poultry exports by nearly 6 percent from last month due partly to an accelerating outbreak of bird flu that has triggered wider-than-expected trade restrictions. . The steep cuts came as the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed a second commercial flock of turkeys in South Dakota has been infected with the H5N2 flu, which can kill nearly an entire flock of poultry in 48 hours.  . Birds in eight other states have tested positive for the same lethal strain since the beginning of the year, prompting key overseas buyers such as Mexico and Canada to limit imports of U.S. poultry and eggs from states and counties with infections. The most damaging restrictions to the $5.7 billion U.S. export market have been countrywide import bans imposed by China and South Korea. . “We didn’t expect China or South Korea really to take as severe, drastic action as they did,” said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council. . Last year, China and South Korea accounted for about $428.5 million in export sales of poultry meat and products, according to USDA data. . The USDA, in a monthly supply and demand report, dropped its estimate for turkey exports in 2015 to 720 million lbs (327,000 tonnes) from 765 million lbs in March and 804 million last year. Exports for broiler chickens were pegged at 6.68 billion lbs, down from 7.1 billion last month and 7.3 billion last year. . Strength in the U.S. dollar, which makes U.S. farm products less attractive to overseas buyers, makes it difficult for exporters to expand business in the face of trade restrictions due to bird flu, the USDA said. . The number of U.S. infections in poultry has been climbing as migratory ducks, which are believed to be spreading the virus, are traveling to northern states after spending the winter farther south, experts said. . The latest inflected flock of 34,000 turkeys in South Dakota will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. No human infections have been detected. |Thu Apr 09 21:24:27 +0000 2015||U.S. cuts poultry export forecast as deadly bird flu spreads |5.862785247487508e+17|http://reut.rs/1abCAQY
Carey Gillam|(Reuters) - U.S. consumer groups, scientists and food companies are testing substances ranging from breakfast cereal to breast milk for residues of the world’s most widely used herbicide on rising concerns over its possible links to disease. . The focus is on glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. Testing has increased in the last two years, but  scientists say requests spiked after a World Health Organization research unit said last month it was classifying glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” . “The requests keep coming in,” said Ben Winkler, laboratory manager at Microbe Inotech Laboratories in St. Louis. The commercial lab has received three to four requests a week to test foods and other substances for glyphosate residues. In prior years, it received only three to four requests annually, according to its records. . “Some people want to stay out in front of this. Nobody knows what it means yet, but a lot of people are testing,” said Winkler. . Microbe has handled recent requests for glyphosate residue testing from small food companies, an advocacy group testing baby formula and a group of doctors who want to test patients’ urine for glyphosate residues, said Winkler. The firms and doctors do not want their identities published. . Abraxis LLC, a Warminster, Pennsylvania-based diagnostics company, has also seen a “measurable increase” in glyphosate testing, said Abraxis partner Dave Deardorff.  . Monsanto Co, the maker of Roundup, on April 1 posted a blog seeking to reassure consumers and others about glyphosate residues.  . “According to physicians and other food safety experts, the mere presence of a chemical itself is not a human health hazard. It is the amount, or dose, that matters,” Monsanto senior toxicologist Kimberly Hodge-Bell said in the blog. Trace amounts are not unsafe, she stated. . Company spokeswoman Charla Lord said last week that further questions could be directed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  . There are numerous studies that have determined glyphosate to be safe, but several others have linked it to human health ailments. Critics say they fear that glyphosate is so pervasive in the environment that extended exposure even to trace amounts can be harmful.  . Tests by Abraxis found glyphosate residues in 41 of 69 honey samples and in 10 of 28 soy sauces; Microbe tests detected glyphosate in three of 18 breast milk samples and in six of 40 infant formula samples. . North Dakota State University agronomist Joel Ransom  reported to the U.S. Wheat Quality Council in February that tests he ordered showed traces of glyphosate in several U.S. and Canadian flour samples. |Thu Apr 09 21:04:15 +0000 2015||Fears over Roundup herbicide residues prompt private testing |5.862734418016993e+17|http://reut.rs/1DpfmCU
|MONROVIA (Reuters) - A report by Liberia’s anti-corruption watchdog found some $800,000 spent in the fight against Ebola at the height of the outbreak of the disease last year was not properly accounted for, most of it passing through the defense ministry. . The General Auditing Commission (GAC) report covering the period from August to October 2014 analyzed more than $13 million spent by the National Ebola Trust Fund (NETF). The funds mostly came from foreign donations.  . “The conduct of the affairs of the ...(NETF) were marred by financial irregularities and material control deficiencies,” read the report, published on the GAC web site. . The Ebola epidemic, which began in December 2013, has claimed nearly 10,600 lives, mostly in Liberia, neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . Liberia’s last known Ebola patient died on March 27, starting a 42-day countdown for the country to be declared free of the virus.     . The government said in a statement that it welcomed the report and pledged to take appropriate corrective measures, including possible prosecutions and tighter spending controls. . It said auditees could still bring appropriate documentation to a public hearing by the National Legislature.   . The audit did not include donations from international organizations including the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign donors whose contribution did not flow through the NETF.      |Thu Apr 09 19:49:50 +0000 2015||Liberia watchdog says some Ebola funds unaccounted for |5.86254712523096e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dp1vfF
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - - Hikers and winter sports aficionados who venture deep into snow country and get caught in an avalanche may find emergency beacons are less effective if the searcher is also using a diabetes monitor or insulin pump, according to a small study. . “The potential for interference between a diabetes device and an avalanche beacon (in search mode) is increased if both devices are held in close proximity and reduced if they are separated,” said lead author Dr. Steven Miller, a researcher at North Shore Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand.  . So-called avalanche beacons both transmit and receive signals that can be used to locate and rescue a person buried under the snow by an avalanche. In a typical scenario, companions who escape being buried can use their transceivers to start searching immediately for the beacon signal of someone who is missing.  . Previous research has shown that the transceiver searching for a signal from another beacon can be rendered less effective by interference from cell phones, MP3 players and other electronic devices, Miller and colleagues note in Wilderness and Environmental Medicine. The devices are not themselves affected by the avalanche beacons, though. . People with type 1 diabetes need continual monitoring and adjustments to maintain an ideal balance of insulin and glucose in their blood. Implanted insulin pumps and glucose monitors can wirelessly transmit information to each other to keep blood glucose under control for weeks at a time. . For the current study, researchers examined how well two commonly used avalanche beacon-transceivers could detect signals in an open field. Then they explored whether placing personal electronic devices such as mobile phones and two-way radios, as well as insulin pumps and blood sugar monitors for diabetes, nearby would limit the distance at which the receiver could detect another beacon’s signal.  . They found that the greatest distance at which the transceiver could accurately detect the location of a transmitting beacon was 30 meters (about 100 feet), but the search range was reduced to just 5 meters (16 feet) when the beacon was placed within 30 centimeters (about 12 inches) of an iPhone 4, an iPhone 5 or an insulin pump, the Animas Vibe.  . One type of blood sugar monitor, the Dexcom G4 rtCGMS, didn’t appear to interfere at all with the transceiver’s ability to detect a signal. And none of the devices interfered with the transmitting beacon’s ability to send its signal. . The reduction in the searching beacon’s range of detection from 30 meters to 5 meters is significant, and has the potential to delay the rescue of a buried avalanche victim, the researchers write. . “I suggest therefore that any electronic device – including an insulin pump or a continuous glucose monitor, but also a MP3, cell phone, radio, etc – is kept as far away as possible from the avalanche beacon,” Miller said in an email. . To minimize the risk of signal interference, people might wear the avalanche beacon on an upper arm and then place a diabetes device lower on the body, said Dr. Lutz Heinemann, a partner and scientific consultant at Profil Institute for Clinical Research in Neuss, Germany.  . “To my knowledge, many patients with diabetes (mainly type 1) do such hiking trips and I have not heard about any issues,” Heinemann, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “I don’t have data on hand about how many patients carry an avalanche beacon while hiking, but this sounds like not too common a combination.” .

Jim Forsyth|SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Three cases of Listeria linked to tainted Blue Bell ice cream have been found in Texas, U.S. health authorities said on Thursday, with the recently discovered infections related to a strain thought to be a factor in three deaths in Kansas. . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the three people in Texas had been hospitalized for unrelated illnesses and appear to have developed the disease from eating tainted ice cream made at a Blue Bell plant in the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, it said. . The CDC did not give a location for the Texas patients but said they contracted Listeria between 2011 and 2014 and none died.  . While the incidences occurred in the past, health officials first identified a cluster of the strain last month.  . Since then, the Blue Bell plant has been temporarily closed and major grocery stores have recalled the product. . The strain identified in Texas is the same as that confirmed in Kansas, it said. . This brings to eight the number of people who contracted Listeria linked to Blue Bell products. The other five were in a hospital in Wichita, Kansas, and three of those patients died. Officials said Listeriosis was not the cause of their deaths, but it may have been a contributing factor. . According to the CDC, Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria. It primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and those with compromised immune systems. It can lead to death. . Blue Bell has issued three separate recalls of its products, and says it is working closely with federal officials from the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to get to the bottom of the Listeriosis outbreak.   |Thu Apr 09 18:58:12 +0000 2015||Three in Texas infected with Listeria from tainted ice cream: CDC |5.862417204902748e+17|http://reut.rs/1DoRX4s
Magdalena Mis|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cooking rice or pasta with tomato sauce may not look like a big challenge, but the job of a chef on a migrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean is no picnic.  . “Cooking in a very small galley for 300 people and trying to keep everything warm and good for everybody is quite a big job,” Christian Peregin, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS)spokesman, said on Thursday. . “It takes some talent and some craft to be able to cook simple but very nutritious food and keep it good,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Malta.  . MOAS, the first privately funded rescue service of its kind,  saved 3,000 migrants from rickety boats in the Mediterranean in 2014, and announced on Monday that wanted “great chefs to brave the Mediterranean waters in exchange for an extraordinary life-saving adventure”. . Although MOAS may not be looking for a Jamie Oliver-style gourmet chef, it would certainly welcome celebrity endorsement,  Peregin said. . “We rely on donations, so I think any sort of celebrity type of endorsement or any celebrity partnership, which would raise our profile and help convince more people to donate money to give us more sustainability, would be very welcome,” he said. . “Someone of the profile of Jamie Oliver would be fantastic.” . Peregin said MOAS had so far received some 20 applications and hoped to have the first volunteer chefs out at sea by July. . Founded by Malta-based Christopher and Regina Catrambone, MOAS launched its rescue service at the end of August last year. . They spent millions of euros on a 40-metre ship, the Phoenix, equipped with rescue dinghies and drones, and manned by a professional crew. . The couple said they felt compelled to act following an appeal by the Pope after several hundred African migrants drowned off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October 2013. |Thu Apr 09 18:01:58 +0000 2015||Mediterranean rescuers in quest for seaborne migrants' chef |5.862275685269176e+17|http://reut.rs/1CuvM85
Tim McLaughlin|BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Officer Abigail Johnson is betting part of her personal fortune on several companies developing cancer treatments, including three that have recently announced plans for initial public offerings. . In recent months, biopharmaceutical investments made on behalf of the 53-year-old billionaire and her siblings either have surged in value or have advanced further toward their stock market debuts. . Johnson has made her investments through Impresa Management LLC, whose key shareholders include trusts for her and two siblings, Edward C. Johnson IV and Elizabeth Johnson, according to recent disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  . Abigail Johnson, who runs the No. 2 U.S. mutual fund company, was a pre-IPO investor in Coherus BioSciences Inc. Coherus, whose shares have more than doubled since going public in November, is developing a biosimilar drug for Neulasta, a medicine that boosts the body’s immune system during chemotherapy. . Impresa owned Coherus shares worth $10 million on Dec. 31, filings show. The stock’s value has climbed more than 60 percent since then. . Impresa has $2.3 billion in assets under management. One of its biggest holdings at the end of last year was a $353 million stake in Chinese Internet commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, SEC filings show. . Johnson also is poised to capitalize on the stock market debuts of Adaptimmune Therapeutics Plc, ViewRay Inc and Blueprint Medicines Corp, SEC filings show.  . United Kingdom-based Adaptimmune this week disclosed plans to raise up to $150 million in an IPO to help advance cancer-fighting therapies that use white blood cells. . Adaptimmune’s investors include Beacon Bioventures, which has Impresa as a general partner. Beacon owns about 13.6 million preferred shares in the company, SEC filings show.  . Beacon and Impresa hold about a 23 percent stake in Cleveland-based ViewRay, which filed for a $64 million IPO in February and makes an MRI machine that targets soft-tissue tumors with radiation. . In a similar arrangement, Beacon and Impresa own 42 percent of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Blueprint Medicines. The company filed for a $100 million IPO last month, with plans to use the proceeds to advance the development of its anti-cancer treatments. . Forbes estimates Johnson’s net worth at about $13 billion. She declined to comment for this story.  . Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said the investments were private holdings and did not affect the company’s mutual funds. |Thu Apr 09 17:00:56 +0000 2015||Fidelity CEO taps personal fortune for bets on cancer-related IPOs |5.862122067291341e+17|http://reut.rs/1CufHPU
|PARIS/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic H7N3 bird flu virus in two backyards in the states of Oaxaca and Puebla in the southern part of the country, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Thursday. . Following a notification by the homeowners of an increase in the sudden death of birds, 139 birds were found infected by the virus, the Mexican agriculture ministry said in a report posted on the website of the Paris-based organisation. . “The official veterinary services launched the necessary epidemiological investigation and the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7N3 was confirmed,” it said. . Both outbreaks were confirmed as positive for avian influenza on March 9. The report said that so far, no epidemiological link had been identified between them. . Mexico’s agriculture ministry said in a statement on Thursday that the reported cases were immediately controlled  and that animal health authorities had not found any other infected birds. No traces of the virus were found within a 10 kilometer radius of the area, the ministry said.  . The ministry also said poultry companies in the areas had not been affected. |Thu Apr 09 16:27:23 +0000 2015||Mexico reports bird flu outbreaks in Puebla and Oaxaca states |5.862037667744645e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cu6UgG
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Special impact-absorbing flooring reduced fall injuries by nearly 60 percent in a new study of women in Swedish nursing homes, though the soft floors may also be linked to more falls, according to the authors.  . “Falls are extremely common in nursing home residents, approximately 70 percent are fallers and they fall on average three to four times per year,” said lead author Johanna Gustavsson of Karlstad University in Sweden. “The consequences are often very serious, for example resulting in hip fractures or head injuries.” . In the U.S., one of every three adults over age 65 falls each year, with about one quarter of those sustaining moderate to severe injuries that “make it hard for them to get around or live independently, and increase their risk of early death,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . The direct medical costs of falls by seniors are estimated at $34 billion annually, according to CDC. . The idea of reducing force to reduce the risk of injuries in an accident is by no means new, it has been tested in many fields like traffic and sports, Gustavsson said. . But impact-absorbing floors have not been widely tested, and the reduction in injury rate in the new study was greater than she and her coauthors expected, Gustavsson told Reuters Health by email. . The researchers collected fall and injury data from a nursing home in Sweden with 60 apartments divided into six wards. Six of the 60 apartments had New Zealand-manufactured Kradal brand 12-millimeter flexible impact absorbing tiles installed. This flooring is not approved for wet areas and was not installed in any bathrooms. . The half-inch thick tiles have a spongy polyurethane/polyurea interior. According to the manufacturer, they reduce the force of an impact by 65-85 percent, compared to concrete floors. . Between late 2011 and early 2014, 57 female nursing home residents with an average age of 85 participated in the study, 39 of whom fell at least once. Nursing home staff recorded 254 falls on regular flooring and 77 on impact absorbing flooring.  . Almost 17 percent of falls on the special flooring resulted in an injury, compared to 30 percent of falls on regular flooring, according to results in Injury Prevention.  . Most injuries were relatively minor, with between one and two percent resulting in hip fracture. Major injuries were equally common on both types of flooring, but minor injuries were less common on the soft floors.  . Although fall injuries were less common on the impact absorbing floors, falls seemed to be more common.  . “If indeed flooring was in less than 10 percent of the areas, then 10 percent of the falls would have occurred on the impact absorbing areas, but more than twice that many were on the impact absorbing floors,” said Dr. Peter M. Layde of the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, who was not a part of the new study. . “It raises the possibility that softer flooring might actually increase risk of falling,” Layde told Reuters Health by phone.  . However, in this and other studies, there is a chance that nursing home staff moved patients who were more likely to fall into the softer flooring areas, Gustavsson said. . “We have indications that this was also the case in our study with staff moving elderly that were prone to fall to the areas with the special flooring in order to protect them, as they perceived that the flooring ‘worked’,” she said. “This was out of our control and nothing we could (or wanted) to prevent.” . M. Clare Robertson of the Dunedin School of Medicine at the University of Otago in New Zealand was involved with the initial testing of Kradal, and found no difference in standing, balance, walking or stability compared with standard vinyl or carpeted floors, she told Reuters Health by email. . Over the three-year period of the study, only six women fell on the impact absorbing floors and three fell on both types of floor, which means only nine individuals fell on the new flooring, Layde said. Such a small group limits how much the results can be interpreted, he said. . Bathrooms are a frequent location of falls, but the special flooring is not applicable there, he noted. . Still, the idea is “tantalizing” and deserves more investigation, Layde said. . “The use of this type of flooring is still in an experimental stage but there are some ongoing trials across the world,” Gustavsson said.  . There will need to be more tests to find the best mix of injury prevention and usability, she said.  . “Many aspects have to be considered for floorings in care settings: work environment, maintenance and hygiene to mention a few,” she said. The staff of this particular nursing home did appreciate the improved acoustic environment with the new floors, she noted. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - When surgeons prepare patients for an operation by describing how it can fix a problem, patients may agree to procedures without fully understanding the risks, a small study suggests. . “As doctors, we really want to help patients to understand what is wrong with them and how to treat it, and that’s really complicated, so the ‘fix-it’ model can simplify the issues for patients,” senior study author Margaret Schwarze, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, said in an email. . But there are two big problems with the “fix-it” approach, she said. . “The patient gets the message that because something is broken, it has to be fixed, and that might not be the case,” Schwarze said. Another flaw is the assumption that surgery will return patients back to how they normally were before they got sick or hurt. “For many patients, especially patients with lots of medical problems who need big operations, they are not normal after surgery.” . Schwarze and colleagues analyzed 48 recordings of surgeons explaining high-risk operations to patients treated at three different academic hospitals in Madison, Boston and Toronto and found that variations on the “fix-it” theme regularly cropped up in these conversations.  . Researchers reviewed transcripts of the discussions to see how surgeons deployed “fix-it” analogies to describe operations, which included various heart and brain surgeries as well as complex tumor-removal procedures.  . About half the patients in the study were weighing procedures with a death risk of at least 3 percent, indicating a higher than usual potential for complications.  . Often, surgeons portrayed medical conditions as broken parts and defective organ functions and then proposed an operation as a way to fix the problem. . They rarely used the “fix-it” model as the only decision-making framework and rationale for operating, however. The surgeons laid out risks and benefits of various treatment options. They might stress that the patient’s medical problem might not be cured by an operation or note that the most prominent symptoms might not be eased by surgery. . While the researchers didn’t speak to patients to see how well they actually understood their options, it’s possible that they might agree to a risky operation without really knowing the limits of what surgery can do to improve their lives, the study team writes in the Annals of Surgery. . It may not work to use a simple “fix-it” analogy during deliberation about treatment options, said Dr. Michael Rothberg, vice chair for research in the medicine institute at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.  . “There’s a role for it; the role is in trying to explain the procedure once somebody understands the risks and benefits and decides they want to have it,” said Rothberg, who wasn’t involved in the study.   . Patients need to understand their condition, and know that sometimes the surgery can ease symptoms but can’t solve the underlying problem, he said. Symptom relief can also be an open question.  . “There are a lot of surgeries where we really don’t know how well they are going to relieve the symptoms or prevent something bad from happening in the future,” Rothberg said. . To make sure they grasp the risks and benefits, patients should always ask surgeons to explain what will happen if they do the procedure, and what will happen if they don’t, he added. . Those questions will help take the conversation in a direction that makes it easier to make an informed decision, Schwarze said. She also suggested that patients ask whether surgery will make them feel better, or help them live longer, as well as what daily life might look like in the days and months after surgery and over the long haul. . “Fix-it might be a great model for appendicitis but it’s not a good model for patients who need major surgery and have multiple chronic conditions,” she said.  . For example, Schwarze does a lot of bypass surgery on patients with atherosclerosis, when fatty deposits build up inside arteries creating a risk for heart attacks and strokes. Often, these patients also have diabetes or kidney disease, she said.  . “The bypass is not fixing their problem,” Schwarze said. “It will often make them feel better because their leg doesn’t hurt so much but to even imply that I am fixing this patient’s disease is incorrect.” .

|Doctors may be able to detect type 1 diabetes in children before they exhibit any symptoms of the disease, new research from Sweden shows. . Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that often appears in childhood and is the result of the body being unable to produce the hormone insulin. . Scientists taking part in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) project have discovered four markers, or autoantibodies, in the blood of the study’s participants that make it possible to detect the disease earlier, meaning that treatment can also start earlier. . Type 1 diabetes occurs when beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the autoantibodies. Once the beta cells are destroyed, the body can no longer produce insulin and cannot regulate blood sugar. . Lead researcher Ake Lernmark, from Sweden’s Lund University, says that measuring the levels of autoantibdodies in children’s blood indicates whether their immune system has started to attack beta cells. . He says the autoantibodies appear years before the disease is usually diagnosed. . “So the TEDDY study has discovered that the appearance of autoantibodies against insulin producing cells, appear during the first years of life, but the disease is not diagnosed until some ten years later So that’s the discovery. We now know where to look for the trigger so we have to explain why this auto anti-bodies develop and now we know that we should look during the first years of life,” Lernmark told Reuters . The TEDDY study, which is funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), involves 8,600 children - with an increased hereditary risk of type 1 diabetes - from Sweden, the United States, Germany and Finland. . Lernmark’s work has revealed triggers of type 1 diabetes in children at a much earlier stage than was previously possible. The team now wants to test all four-year-old children in Sweden. . “For the first time it will allow the researchers to look, to study, the mechanisms that trigger this disease because in the past we didn’t know when to look. So if you take a newly diagnosed child and you ask the question what happened to that child a month before diagnosis, or one year before diagnosis - we already missed the point and the point is that we have to look for the trigger during the first years of life, not in conjunction with the diagnosis of diabetes - it’s too late,” he said. . The new discovery could lead to earlier treatment and lower doses of insulin used to treat the condition. It may even be possible for sufferers to postpone or avoid symptoms as the disease develops. . Fredrik Nicklasson’s children have been taking part in the study since birth. He has to keep regular and detailed food diaries for his son and two daughters, while they have to submit blood, stool and nail samples, as well as information about illnesses and medication. . Nicklasson said the children did not mind the regular checks, as it didn’t feel like a hospital but more like play-school or a day-care center. . “Well, I think they think it’s quite fun - most of the time - because it also involves some blood sampling but in our family that hasn’t been a big issue,” he said. . Cornelia and Hedvig Nicklasson are used to the drill. . “She usually asks some questions... about what I eat, what I do and then I’m measured to see how tall I am and how much I weigh compared to last time and then they take a blood sample,” Cornelia said. . “They take a blood sample, weigh and measure me and I’ve had to answer some questions,” said Hedvig. . It is still not known what causes the immune system to start attacking the body’s own insulin cells to start off with. One theory is that a virus could be the trigger. . There is no cure for type 1 diabetes at the moment, but Lernmark said a long term goal would be to find a vaccine. . “So let’s assume, or hypothesize that there is a virus being responsible for triggering these autoantibodies, the goal is then to make a vaccine against that virus and if that would be the discovery then the chances to prevent type-1 diabetes altogether is very high,” he said. .

Abdoulaye Massalaki|NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger has identified a suspected outbreak of H5N1 bird flu on a chicken farm in the southern town of Maradi, near the border with Nigeria which has confirmed cases of the virus in several northern states. . Authorities in Niger said late on Wednesday they had isolated the farm and banned the transport of all poultry out of the town, the third largest in the country, as they waited for samples to be tested in Italy. . The suspected cases in Niger come a week after neighboring Burkina Faso also confirmed an outbreak of H5N1.  . A number of nations in the region, where borders are porous and millions rely on poultry farming as a source of income, last faced a major outbreak of bird flu in 2006. . Bangana Ibrahim, Niger’s livestock minister, said authorities suspected bird flu on the Maradi farm after more than half of the 2,440 chickens on it died. . Ibrahim said that all poultry imports from any nation that had confirmed bird flu had been banned as of April 7. Ivory Coast and Mali have imposed similar preventative measures. . For now there was no risk of human infection in Ivory Coast, said Dr. Daouda Coulibaly, head of epidemic surveillance at the ministry of health, who worked to contain the 2006 outbreak. . “Currently we’re in the phase of monitoring animal health,” he told Reuters. “If at some point it’s confirmed there are cases among our poultry, we’ll roll out phase two, which is to protect the population because, in being exposed to that poultry, they too could be infected.”  . Ivory Coast has already turned back around 30,000 chickens at the Burkinabe border, Lassina Ouattara, Burkina Faso’s director of veterinary services said on Thursday. . “The economic implications of this bird flu epidemic are serious,” he said. “Today we are in an emergency situation to respond to the epidemic, but we are already thinking of how to relaunch the sector once the crisis is contained.”  . At least five people have died from bird flu in Egypt this year. |Thu Apr 09 12:26:17 +0000 2015||Niger isolates suspected bird flu farm as region takes precautions |5.861430918931087e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ct7r2B
|(Reuters) - Sabra Dipping Company voluntarily recalled 30,000 cases of its classic hummus nationwide over possible Listeria contamination, federal health officials and the company said on Wednesday. . The recall follows warnings from U.S. health officials over the weekend against eating any products from a Blue Bell Creameries’ Oklahoma ice cream plant, which has temporarily closed because of possible Listeria contamination. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday that a routine sample of Sabra hummus collected from a store last month tested positive for the Listeria monocytogenes. It added that there was no evidence the hummus caused anyone to become ill. . According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria. It primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and those with compromised immune systems and can lead to death. . Earlier this month, Kansas health officials said three people died between January 2014 and January 2015 after being sickened by Listeriosis at a hospital where Blue Bell products were served. They were in the hospital for other reasons. . Blue ​Bell said in a statement on Tuesday that no illnesses linked to its products had been confirmed. . The U.S. CDC said in a statement on Wednesday the in-hospital infections were “likely linked” to its products. . The CDC said a total of five patients were sickened in Kansas and three other patients were sickened in Texas. . Blue Bell said its voluntary recalls were the first in the company’s more than 100-year history. |Thu Apr 09 06:03:35 +0000 2015||Sabra Dipping Co recalls 30,000 cases of hummus over Listeria fears |5.860467810557051e+17|http://reut.rs/1CrMAwn
Curtis Skinner|(Reuters) - California lawmakers on Wednesday pushed forward a bill that would ban parents from citing their personal beliefs as a reason to let their school-going children remain unvaccinated. . The measure passed the state Senate health committee by a vote of 6-2, the bill’s co-author, Democrat Richard Pan, said in a statement. . “I’ve personally witnessed the suffering caused by vaccine-preventable diseases, and all children deserve to be safe at school,” said Pan, who is also a pediatrician. . “The personal belief exemption is now putting other school children and people in our community in danger.” . Pan proposed the bill, which would leave in place medical exemptions to vaccinations, in the wake of a major measles outbreak in the state that began at Disneyland in December.  . All told, more than 150 people across the United Sates have been diagnosed with measles in recent months, 126 of them in California. . The outbreak renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccinations, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, prompted a small minority of parents to refuse them for their children. . The proposal, which must clear several other legislative hurdles before a possible Senate floor vote, prompted roughly four hours of heated discussion that saw several people removed for shouting down lawmakers, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported. . Detractors of the bill, including Republican senator Jim Nielsen who voted against it on Wednesday, said it tramples on a parent’s rights, the Bee reported. . “I have very profound feelings about parental rights and responsibilities and great dismay in American society over the decades how much that parental right, that parental responsibility has diminished,” Nielsen said, according to the newspaper. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after years of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within several weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Thu Apr 09 05:16:24 +0000 2015||California bill banning child vaccine exemptions moves ahead |5.860349062764339e+17|http://reut.rs/1CrDIH4
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu accelerated on Wednesday with the infection of a sixth turkey flock in Minnesota, the nation’s top turkey-producing state, in less than a week.     . The infected flock of 310,000 turkeys was the ninth case of the H5N2 flu in Minnesota in just over a month and the biggest flock yet to be confirmed with the disease, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The virus was detected at a facility west of Minneapolis that is owned by a subsidiary of Spam maker Hormel Foods Corp, the company said. . Since the beginning of the year, the flu, which can kill nearly an entire poultry flock within 48 hours, has also been found in birds from Oregon to Arkansas. The discoveries have prompted major overseas buyers such as Mexico and Canada to limit imports of U.S. poultry and companies such as Tyson Foods Inc to strengthen measures to keep the disease off farms. . The number of infections is climbing as migratory ducks, which are believed to be spreading the disease, return to Minnesota to breed after spending the winter farther south, said Beth Thompson, assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. The larger number of ducks likely increases the risk for wild birds to transmit the virus. . Farm workers are probably infecting turkeys by tracking the virus into barns after stepping in contaminated duck feces, said John Glisson, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. Chicken flocks are also vulnerable. . “Minnesota is a real hotbed for returning waterfowl,” Glisson said. . The USDA has said it believes migratory ducks are spreading the flu and sent a team to Minnesota to determine how it is moving into poultry flocks. . So far, efforts to stop the spread by controlling human and vehicle traffic on farms have not worked.  . The number of infections may continue to rise through mid-May, when spring migration ends, said Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. New cases may accelerate again in the autumn when recently hatched ducks, which have never been exposed to the virus, begin migrating south, he added. . The H5N2 flu will likely remain a threat to U.S. poultry for three to five years, Olson said, citing information from wildlife experts. That is how long it will take wild birds to develop immunity to the disease. . No human cases have been detected. |Thu Apr 09 00:01:17 +0000 2015||U.S. bird flu outbreak accelerates as wild ducks migrate north |5.859556071251067e+17|http://reut.rs/1CqEV1z
Jessica Dye|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruling on Wednesday could make it more difficult for smokers suing tobacco companies in Florida to prove claims that cigarettes are dangerous and that tobacco companies were negligent.   . The ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses more than $800,000 in damages from R.J. Reynolds and Altria Group Inc unit Philip Morris USA Inc awarded in 2013 to Earl Graham, whose wife Faye, a longtime smoker, died in 1993 of lung cancer.  . More broadly, the court said smokers who, like Graham, were originally part of a massive class action in Florida against the tobacco companies could not rely on findings from the class action trial to prove claims that cigarettes are defective and tobacco companies were negligent.  . That class action, Engle v. Liggett, resulted in a $145 billion award, which was overturned. But the Florida Supreme Court in 2006 said smokers could use findings from the trial in their individual lawsuits. Thousands of lawsuits, known as the Engle progeny, were filed in Florida federal and state courts, resulting in multiple multimillion-dollar verdicts against tobacco defendants.  . In appealing the Graham verdict, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris said it was unfair to allow Engle progeny plaintiffs to hold tobacco companies liable based on the class action jury findings, which have been applied across the board to many cigarette brands and makers.  . The 11th Circuit agreed, saying Florida courts had interpreted those findings with such “unprecedented breadth” that it created a legal duty that was the “functional equivalent of a flat ban” on tobacco, which the U.S. Congress had expressly declined to impose. Plaintiffs bringing strict liability and negligence claims against the tobacco companies must build cases based on their specific injury rather than the inherent risks of smoking, the 11th Circuit held.  . The decision will not affect claims alleging that companies conspired to cover up the dangers of smoking, the ruling said.  . Philip Morris declined to comment. Lawyers for the plaintiff and R.J. Reynolds could not immediately be reached for comment.  . Tobacco companies said in February that they will pay $100 million to settle most federal smoking lawsuits. Thousands of cases remain pending in state court. While the 11th Circuit’s ruling will not have an immediate effect there, Florida state appeals courts have often looked to that court for guidance in ruling on similar issues.  . The case is Graham v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-14590. |Thu Apr 09 00:01:17 +0000 2015||U.S. appeals court deals setback to Florida tobacco plaintiffs |5.859556050111775e+17|http://reut.rs/1DlT2K8
Jon Herskovitz|(Reuters) - The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday passed a ban on the main procedure used for second trimester abortions, a day after neighboring Kansas became the first state to ban the practice that its critics call “dismemberment abortions.” . The “Dismemberment Abortion Act” passed easily in both houses of the Republican-dominated Oklahoma legislature and should soon head to Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, who has been a staunch supporter of abortion restrictions. . The procedure is set to be the newest political flashpoint in the U.S. debate over reproductive rights with groups opposed to abortions looking to introduce similar bans in other states. . “This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,” Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, a prominent group opposed to abortions, said in a statement on Tuesday in regard to the Kansas ban. . The process often referred to as dilation and evacuation is regarded by healthcare experts as the safest way to conduct a second trimester abortion. The fetus is typically removed with forceps, sometimes in pieces. . Imposing bans will interfere with physicians as they try to give the best care to women by reducing access in second trimester abortions, said Elizabeth Nash, with the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion but whose research is cited by both sides in the debate. . “This is a huge overstep by politicians into the medical practice,” said Nash, a specialist in state legislation with the institute. . Nearly 90 percent of U.S. abortions take place in the first trimester. The procedure banned in Kansas was used in about 8 to 9 percent of abortions there.  . Some women are forced to delay the procedure to raise funds for medical care or arrange a trip to a facility that provides abortions, which have become fewer in states where Republican-controlled governments have imposed restrictions that women’s rights groups said are aimed at eliminating clinics. . Kansas has been at the forefront in applying restrictions. Missouri and South Carolina are also looking to impose a similar ban on the second trimester procedure. |Wed Apr 08 23:29:40 +0000 2015||Oklahoma set to join Kansas in banning flashpoint abortion procedure |5.859476507442668e+17|http://reut.rs/1CqyhIC
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - Mothers of kids with disabilities might be more forgetful as they age than other mothers, according to a new study that suggests the stresses of parenting a disabled child wear on mothers’ minds over time. . Fathers of disabled children did not differ from fathers of non-disabled children in memory skills as they aged. And mothers with a strong support system, a sense of control and a history of regular exercise kept sharper than those without those attributes. . “Keeping quality friendship, sense of control for life and physically active lifestyle would help to protect these parents from accelerated cognitive aging,” said Jieun Song, a researcher at the Waisman Centre at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who led the study. . When the mothers in the study had more trouble handling their disabled kids and were older, their memory was worse, the researchers note in Journals of Gerontology: Series B.   . That’s not surprising, considering past research that has shown parents with disabled kids tend to feel more stressed and to have more psychological problems, like depression, than those with children without special needs, the researchers note.  . “Because mothers of children with disabilities are usually more involved in childcare and housework than their spouses, it is likely that these mothers are more exposed to chronic stress and consequently at higher risks of cognitive decline compared with fathers of children with disabilities over the life course,” Song told Reuters Health in an email. . Song said she and her team wanted to study the cognitive effects of parenting kids with disabilities because of the prevalence of these children in the US, the longer lifespans of parents and the large cost to society. . The study used data from a large national survey of parents from 2004 to 2006, examining the history of 128 parents with disabled children and 512 without disabled kids (and who didn’t take care of other disabled children or adults). The kids in the first group had child-onset disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity, autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, epilepsy and intellectual or learning challenges. . Parents were tested on verbal memory and fluency, mental processing speed, reasoning, working memory and ability to switch their attention.   . Physical health, physical activity, depression, sense of control, social support and negative parenting experience were also included in the analysis. . Most of the mothers were in their late 40s and early 50s, had about two years of college and about 85 percent were non-Hispanic white. The mothers of disabled kids tended to be much more depressed, in worse physical health and to feel they had less of a sense of control than mothers without disabled kids.  . For instance, 18 percent of mothers of disabled children reported having been depressed in the 12 months prior to the study, compared with 7 percent of mothers without disabled kids. . Mothers of disabled children also had more problems handling their kids and had less support from friends than women without disabled children.  . Among the women with disabled children, being white, more educated and having more social support were linked to significantly better memory and thinking. . Fathers with disabled kids had more negative parenting experiences than fathers whose kids were not disabled. But there were no significant differences in their cognitive functioning. . The researchers did not have information about the severity of the children’s disabilities, their ages, or about any disabilities or other health problems among the parents that might affect cognition. They acknowledge in their report that because they only looked at one point in time, they cannot say whether parenting a disabled child caused the memory differences they observed. . “One important aspect of this study was that having a sense of control and support from friends helped mitigate the impact of long-term caring for a child with a disability,” said Tamar Heller, who directs the Institute on Disabilities and Human Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  . “Overall, their findings buttress the need for family support services and supports for families of individuals with disabilities,” said Heller, who was not involved in the study. “It shows significant disparities for this population making these services and supports a public policy priority.” . Heller noted that her own research has found that if families received enough help from support services, they were much less likely to experience “caregiving burden.” . She added, “When families are involved in consumer-directed programs where they can direct the supports provided to their families, they are more likely to experience less burden and feel a greater sense of parenting competence. This study reinforces these notions that personal control and support are important in reducing stress and potential consequent cognitive declines.” . SOURCE: .

Deena Beasley|(Reuters) - Celladon Corp expects to report this month results from a key trial of Mydicar, its experimental gene therapy for advanced heart failure, a condition in which the heart muscle cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. . The upcoming results are seen as a big test for the more than 20-year-old field, which has re-emerged after a series of disappointments and safety concerns. On Monday, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co acquired a nearly 5 percent stake in uniQure NV, sending shares of the Dutch gene therapy producer up 55 percent. . “If our data are positive, I think there will be a lot of competition because it is an enormous market,” Celladon Chief Executive Officer Krisztina Zsebo said in a recent interview with Reuters. More than 5 million Americans are living with heart failure, costing the nation around $32 billion each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Gene therapies aim to insert corrective genes into malfunctioning cells. Celladon’s Mydicar is a virus designed to deliver a gene that reconstitutes an enzyme responsible for heart muscle contraction. . An early trial in patients with advanced heart failure found that Mydicar reduced hospitalizations by 88 percent after 12 months, and 80 percent at the three-year mark. A confirmatory, Phase 2b, trial of 250 patients will be unblinded at the end of this month. . Mydicar has been granted both “breakthrough” and “fast-track” status by the Food and Drug Administration. Celladon is planning a larger, pivotal trial, but it is possible that if the upcoming data are strong enough, Mydicar could be approved in certain geographies, Zsebo said. . She said studies have shown no evidence of toxicity, but there are questions about how long the effect of the gene therapy will persist. If Mydicar is approved, patients would probably be treated just once due to the likelihood that their bodies would develop antibodies against the introduced proteins. . Shares of San Diego-based Celladon, which went public last year, closed at $17.49 on Wednesday, a drop of about 30 percent in the past four weeks. . If Mydicar is approved, Zsebo said the gene therapy would be priced like any other biologic drug. She said Celladon would not seek any “crazy annuity-based pricing,” nor would it set a price in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is what companies currently charge for enzyme replacement therapies used to treat rare diseases. |Wed Apr 08 21:01:12 +0000 2015||Celladon to report results of its gene therapy for heart failure: CEO |5.859102839541719e+17|http://reut.rs/1CpZ6g0
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - In a new study of people over age 85, those who said they engaged in things like painting, quilting or book clubs during middle age were less likely to develop memory impairments that may precede dementia. . Based on these results, using your brain for cognitive and social activities seems to preserve cognitive function or keep the neurons stimulated, said lead author Rosebud O. Roberts of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  . “What is surprising from our study is that you have to begin these activities in midlife and continue through old age,” Roberts told Reuters Health by email. . For the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, 256 people ages 85 to 89 with normal cognitive function filled out questionnaires about their typical activities at age 50 and also during the year prior to study enrollment. Researchers extracted their health histories from medical records. . Every 15 months for roughly the next four years, the participants completed in-person mental status checkups with tests of memory, language, visual-spatial skills and executive function, which includes abilities like reasoning and problem-solving.  . During the study, 121 of the 256 participants developed memory deficits that did not affect their daily functioning, but which may later progress into dementia, which is also called mild cognitive impairment. . Those who said they had engaged in arts, crafts like sculpting or woodworking, or social activities like Bible study or travel during midlife were about half as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment as those who did not, the authors report in the journal Neurology. . “In a sense, what the findings suggest is that such activities engage the brain in a way that keeps it ‘alive’,” Roberts said. “As you use your brain for these activities, we believe that you preserve or maintain function of the brain cells; you may also develop new neurons or neuronal connections that preserve memory and thinking skills.” . Physical exercise may help preserve brain function as well, she said. . “Continued education, learning new things - taking classes in a new area of learning, may also yield positive benefits for cognitive function,” she said. . Those who reported doing arts and crafts or using the computer in their 80s were also less likely than others to develop memory problems. . “For prevention of cognitive decline in old age, I would agree that people need to determine which cognitively stimulating activities they can maintain, and engage in these activities as early in life as possible, and not wait till they are older,” Roberts said. “People who are older can still gain benefit from these activities but the earlier people start and continue through late life, the stronger the benefits they are likely to reap from these activities.” . People with high blood pressure, depression and other chronic conditions were more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment, as has been found in other studies, according to Dr. James E. Galvin of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, who wrote a commentary accompanying the new research. . “That was a confirmation of a lot of the things we already knew,” Galvin said. “What I thought was more interesting was to begin to look at something that reduced the risk. That’s what people want to know.” . Though this study only observed an association between cognitive activities and later memory, and did not test whether certain activities would directly preserve memory, people may begin to try new activities in midlife or later and there should be no downside to trying, Galvin told Reuters Health.  . “The brain is an organ that while you can’t grow new brain cells, is constantly remodeling,” he said. “Doing something that’s stimulating, you build new brain connections and strengthen old connections.” . That can include developing old activities and picking up new ones, he said. . “If you have been knitting since you were 6, at some point it’s not a cognitively stimulating activity,” he said. “If you’ve never painted before, that is stimulating.” . But genetics and other factors play a role as well, and there is no guarantee that trying activities like knitting or book clubs will stave off cognitive decline for every individual, Galvin said. . “I know marathon-running vegan astrophysicists who develop Alzheimer’s Disease and Twinkie-eating couch potatoes who don’t,” he said. “There’s no guarantee.” .

|WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The bird flu virus confirmed this week in the Canadian province of Ontario is the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain, similar to one spreading across the United States, a government agency said on Wednesday. . The strain discovered on a Woodstock, Ontario, turkey farm is the same subtype as one detected in the western province of British Columbia in December and that has spread across U.S. states in recent months, said Paul Mayers, vice president of policy and programs at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). . Mayers said Hong Kong has restricted imports of poultry and poultry products from Oxford County, Ontario, and Uruguay has banned imports of Canadian hatching eggs. On Tuesday, CFIA said Japan and Taiwan had imposed trade restrictions. . Nine Ontario farms, including the single farm confirmed to have the virus, are under quarantine. . About 10,800 turkeys have died at the Woodstock farm and an additional 34,000 birds there will be euthanized using carbon dioxide gas, CFIA said. . The agency has not determined how the virus spread to Ontario, but said it could be transmitted by wild birds. |Wed Apr 08 20:45:22 +0000 2015||Canada bird flu virus in Ontario highly pathogenic strain |5.859062998729236e+17|http://reut.rs/1CpVnPu
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - People with lower back pain or aching hips or knees might not get much relief from the painkiller paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), a review of past research suggests. . “Our systematic review found that paracetamol is ineffective for patients with low back pain and only provides negligible benefits for patients with lower limb osteoarthritis,” said lead study author Gustavo Machado, a researcher at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, Australia. . Millions of people worldwide take the drug - known as acetaminophen (Tylenol) in the U.S. and Japan and paracetamol (Panadol) elsewhere - to relieve fevers as well as common aches and pains, often purchasing it without a prescription or guidance from a clinician. Because of side effects, including the potential for severe liver damage, many doctors recommend that patients limit use to avoid accidental overdoses.  . “Acetaminophen, used properly, is one of the safest medications available to treat pain, but used improperly and excessively it can certainly be dangerous and lead to serious and life-threatening complications,” Dr. Michael Hodgman, a toxicologist at the Upstate New York Poison Center who wasn’t involved in the study, said in an email.  . Machado and colleagues analyzed data from 13 previously published trials exploring the safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen/paracetamol for spinal pain and osteoarthritis.  . The researchers reviewed the effectiveness of the drug for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee in ten trials covering a total of 3,541 patients. They also looked at three trials of lower back pain with 1,825 participants, combined.  . All but one of the studies involved tablets or capsules, while one reported results of intravenous paracetamol for participants with lower back pain.  . In ten of the trials, the daily dosage was about 3,900 to 4,000 milligrams, while three studies looked at about 3,000 milligrams per day.  . In a pooled analysis, the researchers found paracetamol no better than a placebo for lower back pain and only slightly better for osteoarthritis, an age-related breakdown of cartilage and bone at the joints around the hips and knees that causes pain and stiffness. . The researchers also looked at side effects across nine trials and found no difference between paracetamol and placebo.  . Combined results from three trials, however, showed that patients taking paracetamol were four times more likely to have abnormal liver function test results than those on placebo.  . “There is some emerging evidence on harms, showing that paracetamol is associated with increased risk of premature death, and cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and kidney disease,” Machado said in an email. Still, clinical guidelines around the world generally recommend the drug as good first choice for treating pain based on the belief that it is safe, effective and affordable, he said. . Machado’s team acknowledge some limitations in their analysis, including the small number of trials included and their lack of long-term follow-up.  . The study also focused on chronic pain, and doesn’t provide any insight into how the drugs work for acute pain, Dr. Richard Dart, director of the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center, said in an email.  . Dart, who wasn’t involved in the study, also cautioned against reading too much into the liver findings in the analysis, noting that no one had liver failure.  . In addition, patients need to understand that, unlike aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol  isn’t designed to relieve inflammation. It’s a “weak anti-inflammatory agent but efficacious fever medication, mainly for children,” said Dr. Martin Wehling, managing director of the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Heidelberg in Germany.  . “Back pain has little to do with inflammation, therefore paracetamol/acetaminophen may only work in those unidentified patients in whom chronic processes may cause osteoarthritis even in the back,” said Wehling, who wasn’t involved in the study, in an email. . It may make sense, experts said, for patients to try low doses of paracetamol to relieve pain and to continue taking it if it works, as long as they don’t exceed the recommended daily dose. . “It is still a valuable medication as its toxicity is almost entirely restricted to overdose issues,” Wehling said. “If we had less dangerous medications we would certainly remove paracetamol/acetaminophen from the guidelines, but we do not have safer alternatives.” .

|GENEVA (Reuters) - Thirty confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in West Africa in the past week, the smallest number in nearly a year of the worst ever outbreak of the deadly fever, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . “This is the lowest weekly total since the third week of May 2014,” the WHO said in its latest update. . The virus is receding in Liberia, which reported no cases in the week to April 5, and in Sierra Leone, which reported nine, its fifth consecutive weekly decrease, it said.  . But the picture was “mixed” in Guinea, which had 21 new infections, the WHO said. Unsafe burials of bodies continued in Guinea and “unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks”, it warned. . The Ebola epidemic, which began in December 2013, has claimed 10,572 lives among 25,515 known cases, according to the United Nations health agency. . The WHO has called a meeting of independent experts this week to review whether West Africa’s outbreak still constitutes a “public health emergency of international concern”, which it declared in August 2014. A decision is due on Friday. . Ebola is still spreading in western Guinea, including the capital Conakry, but detection of the disease has improved, the WHO said. “A three-day door-to-door campaign to improve community participation in surveillance activities and identify suspected cases will begin on 10 April (Friday)”, it added.  . The last known Ebola case in Liberia was a patient who died  on March 27, and whose 332 contacts are being monitored but none have shown symptoms so far, it said. “Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country,” the WHO said. . “In the context of falling case incidence and a receding zone of transmission, treatment capacity exceeds demand in Liberia and Sierra Leone.” . With technical advice from the WHO, national authorities in both countries have begun to implement plans for the “phased safe decommissioning of surplus facilities”, it said. . Each country would retain a core capacity of high-quality Ebola treatment centers, strategically located to ensure complete geographic coverage, with additional rapid-response capacity held in reserve. |Wed Apr 08 20:05:09 +0000 2015||30 new Ebola cases, lowest weekly figure in nearly a year: WHO |5.85896182100136e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dl7UZo
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - The number of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes dropped by more than half over the past decade as safer vehicles hit the road and more young people received restricted licenses, a U.S. report finds.   . “Many factors are probably at play, but there is wide agreement the graduated licensing programs are an important contributor to the decline in fatal crashes,” lead study author Ruth Shults, an injury prevention researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said by email.  . So-called graduated licenses may limit teen driving at night or restrict teenage passengers, reducing the overall crash rate among the youngest teen drivers by 20 to 40 percent, Shults said.  . Aided by an increase in graduated license programs, the number of drivers aged 16 to 19 involved in fatal crashes fell by 55 percent to 2,568 in 2013, down from 5,724 in 2004, according the CDC report.  . Some of them may not be crashing because they don’t have licenses yet, as more students wait until after they turn 18 to start driving, said Eric Teoh, a senior statistician at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Virginia.  . “An 18-year-old novice is probably more prepared maturity-wise than a 16-year-old novice,” said Teoh, who wasn’t involved in the study. . New safety features in cars, such as electronic stability systems to keep the vehicle in line when the driver starts to lose control, are also contributing to the decline in fatal crashes, Teoh said.  . Across 42 states included in the survey, the proportion of high school students who drive ranged from about 53 percent to about 90 percent, with the highest rates in the midwestern and mountain states, where population density is low. West coast states including California, Washington and Oregon were among eight excluded from the study.  . In cities, fewer students drove, which may be related to family income, shorter travel distances and wider use of public transportation or alternatives such as walking or bicycling.   . Nationwide in 2013, about three in four high school students 16 and older reported driving in the past month; the proportion was lower among black and Hispanic teens compared to white youth.  . Previous research has found that twice as many black students are unlicensed as white students, increasing the odds that they may reach adulthood without having a license and limiting their options for education, housing and employment, the CDC report notes.  . A weak economy has likely contributed to the reduction in fatal crashes while also widening the chasm between students who can afford to drive and those who can’t, said Raymond Bingham, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study. . “The economic downturn resulted in changes in the way people drive, with people taking fewer elective trips,” Bingham said in an email. Leisure trips, as opposed to driving to work or school, are associated with more crashes, he said.  . At the same time that the economy has pushed many families to cut back on car-related expenses, most high schools have also eliminated free driver-education classes, Bingham said. “This combined with the increase in car insurance if you have a teen driver and other costs associated with operating a vehicle adds up to more than many families can afford.” . Research going back several decades has found people of a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to drive, said Brian Tefft, a senior research analyst at the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington, D.C.  . “The observation that minorities and young people who live in lower-income households are less likely to be driving may be related to geographic considerations (access to transit, walkability, general ability to get around without driving) to some degree, but that is definitely not the only factor influencing socioeconomic status-related differences in driving,” Tefft, who wasn’t involved in the study, said in an email.  . While there are more teens of lower socioeconomic status concentrated in cities, Tefft noted, “even if one only looks at teens in rural areas, or only looks at teens in big cities, there is a still a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and teen driving.” .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Although injury prevention programs have been shown to help reduce leg and foot injuries in sports, less than 10% of high school coaches implement the programs as designed, according to a new survey. . Half of coaches are aware of the programs, but many believe they’re too complex or do not offer an advantage over existing practices, researchers found. . “There are a ton of different programs out there,” said lead author Marc F. Norcross of Oregon State University in Corvallis. . Most include stretching and strengthening exercises focused on the hips and thighs, sometimes with jump-training to promote landing softly, Norcross said. Many are designed as 15 to 20 minute warm-ups three to four times per week before practices or games, in place of less structured warm-ups. . “We don’t know exactly how they work, but they are beneficial at least in some respects,” he told Reuters Health. “Rather than sit by and wait for the perfect medicine, let’s adopt this now.” . For the study, 66 head coaches for basketball or soccer at 15 high schools in Oregon completed an online survey of injury prevention program (IPP) knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. . Overall, 34 coaches were aware of IPPs, 14 reported using one of the programs with their team and six said they implemented the IPP exactly as designed. . Coaches of girls’ teams were more likely to be aware of IPPs than boys’ coaches. . Those who didn’t adopt an IPP often said the programs offered no advantage over their current way of doing things, were incompatible with their needs or would be difficult to implement, the authors write in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, online April 1. . “A good proportion didn’t view lower extremity injury as a problem on their team,” Norcross said. . In the 2013-2014 academic year, participants in high school sports in the U.S. sustained more than 300,000 lower-limb injuries that required medical attention and suspension of play for at least one day, according to a report by the Colorado School of Public Health Pediatric Injury Prevention, Education and Research Program. These include minor injuries and more serious ones, like anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. . ACL tears are serious injuries, but a coach may go several years without seeing one on his team and therefore believe they are not an issue, Norcross said.  . “Most of these programs have been developed for ACL but also decrease things like ankle sprains and muscle strains, which are more common,” he said.  . Oregon - like most U.S. states - does not promote awareness or education about lower extremity injury among high school coaches, the authors write.  . Coaches are required to have training on so many important health and safety issues, adding another to their list of requirements may not be the way to address this issue, Norcross said.  . “Sometimes a groundswell might be more beneficial for affecting change than a top-down approach,” he said. “From a layperson perspective, a parent or administrator can ask the coach, are we using this program?” . Coaches who are interested in implementing one can find free resources online for the FIFA 11+ warm-up program, designed for soccer players, or ask health care providers in their area for injury prevention mechanisms, he said. .

Dominique Patton|BEIJING (Reuters) - Three Chinese citizens are taking China’s Ministry of Agriculture to court in a bid to make public a toxicology report supporting the approval of Monsanto’s popular weedkiller, Roundup, 27 years ago. . The case, a rare example of a lawsuit by private citizens against the Chinese government, comes amid renewed attention on glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup, after a controversial report by a World Health Organization group last month found it to be “probably carcinogenic to humans” - a claim denied by Monsanto. . It also underlines the deep-seated fears held by some Chinese over genetically modified food. . Beijing No.3 Intermediate People’s Court had accepted the case but a date for a hearing has not yet been set, an official at the court told Reuters. . Roundup is widely used on crops like soybeans that are genetically modified to resist its impact, allowing farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. China imports about 65 percent of the world’s traded soybeans. . “The government is taking actions to deal with other food safety issues but it is not dealing with the GMO problem,” said  Yang Xiaolu, 62, one of the plaintiffs bringing the case and a long-time GMO activist. . Monsanto officials have said glyphosate has been proven safe for decades, and the company has demanded a retraction from the WHO over its recent report. . Yang and the other plaintiffs, Li Xiangzhen and Tian Xiangping, are demanding in the lawsuit that the agriculture ministry make public the animal test that the ministry cited as evidence to support its approval of Roundup in 1988. . The test report by U.S.-based Younger Laboratories in 1985 was provided by Monsanto to the ministry, according to the plaintiffs, who argue that the ministry should allow the public to know how it determined that Roundup was safe. . The ministry has previously declined to show the plaintiffs the report, arguing that it would infringe on Monsanto’s commercial secrets, said Yang.  . The agriculture ministry did not respond to a fax seeking comment. . The lawsuit comes at a time when the government is trying to foster positive public opinion of GMO food crops, currently banned for cultivation, but seen as crucial to future food security. . GMO seeds under development for China include those that are resistant to glyphosate. . Yang is one of a growing number of activists lodging information disclosure requests amid government promises to become more transparent. . The central government has pledged at recent high-level meetings to improve the rule of law and to step up transparency on sensitive issues such as pollution. . But underscoring the difficulty in challenging the government a Beijing court this week ruled against a similar demand by lawyer Huang Leping for the agriculture ministry to disclose more detail on its imports of genetically modified crops and plans for allowing cultivation in China.  . In the case sparked by the latest lawsuit, the court notified the plaintiffs that Monsanto would be added as a party to the case, said Yang. Monsanto Asia corporate affairs director Yong Gao said he had received no communication from the court and declined to comment on the case. . The company made 5.3 percent of its $15.9 billion in revenues last year from Asia-Pacific markets. The firm’s last relevant patent on glyphosate expired in 2000 and China is now the biggest producer of the herbicide. |Wed Apr 08 10:33:03 +0000 2015||Chinese citizens sue government over transparency on Monsanto herbicide |5.857522072634e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cn9e9f
Jon Herskovitz|(Reuters) - Kansas became the first state to ban a common second trimester abortion procedure when Governor Sam Brownback, a Republican, on Tuesday signed into a law an act to halt what lawmakers said are “dismemberment abortions.” . The law that goes into effect on July 1 prohibits the use of dilation and evacuation. The bill says the procedure can result in the fetus being extracted in pieces.  . Supporters in Kansas have called the procedure horrifying while women’s healthcare groups have said it is considered the safest way to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester. . The law allows for the procedure to preserve the life of a pregnant woman or when the mother’s health is in serious jeopardy from the pregnancy. . Republican-controlled Kansas has taken a leading role in imposing restrictions on abortions, with more than 20 measures being enacted since Brownback took office in 2011, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion but whose research is cited by both sides in the debate.   . The procedure is used in about 8 to 9 percent of abortions nationwide and similar bans are being considered in Oklahoma, Missouri and South Carolina, it said. Nearly 90 percent of U.S. abortions take place in the first trimester.|Wed Apr 08 00:00:39 +0000 2015||Kansas becomes first state to ban a second trimester abortion procedure |5.855930600856699e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cl0YGG
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Specially tailored playgrounds met their goals of increasing kids’ use and physical activity, in a new study from the Netherlands. . The Richard Krajicek Foundation creates public playgrounds – known as Krajicek playgrounds - in deprived neighborhoods there. Each playground has a unique design based on the needs of the kids who are most likely to use it. Each playground is supervised during the busiest times, and coaches are responsible for organizing activities. . Given the positive findings of the new study, researchers say that in underprivileged neighborhoods, adding supervised activities and equipment could increase use of regular playgrounds that are underused and often left deserted.  . “Providing playgrounds . . . that provide a motivating and socially safe play environment will increase physical activity and will have – little but relevant – impact on public health,” said lead author Evert Verhagen of VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam in an email to Reuters Health. . “The problem of inactivity and . . . lifestyle related disorders is greatest in deprived neighborhoods where safe play opportunities are limited,” Verhagen said. . As reported in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, the researchers randomly chose 10 of the 99 Krajicek playgrounds and 10 typical playgrounds as comparisons. . Specially trained college students observed the playgrounds for four days to determine the number of children and their intensity of physical activity at the playgrounds. . The researchers found Krajicek playgrounds empty about 12 percent of the time. The regular playgrounds were empty about 29 percent of the time. . About 13 percent of the kids on the Krajicek playgrounds were engaged in vigorous physical activity, compared to about 10 percent of kids on the regular playgrounds - a small difference. . The Krajicek playgrounds seemed to attract more boys than girls. The researcher suspect boys are attracted to the playgrounds’ team sports like soccer and basketball. . Some designs are probably better than others, Verhagen said, adding that it’s important to take the local neighborhoods into consideration. . “As an example, it would have little use to install a basketball court in a neighborhood where the children are generally of younger age,” he said. “In contrast, swings will appeal less to older youth.” . Verhagen said the best way to match playgrounds to neighborhoods is to talk to the residents. . “Also make sure to include the social environment,” he said. “The playground needs to be accessible to all and not only to a small group of big kids who ‘own’ the playground - all users need to feel safe there.” . The study is important but more research is needed to determine if the design of the playground explains differences in use and activity, said Peter Anthamatten, a researcher with the University of Colorado at Denver.  . The difference may be the equipment, or it could be the adult supervision, said Anthamatten, who was not involved with the new study. . “This is an important debate on how to improve physical activity among schools and there is good research to investigate whether lending equipment, organizing activities, renovating schoolyards, or improving adult supervision is the most effective strategy,” Anthamatten told Reuters Health in an email. . “What the authors can claim is that they observe meaningful difference on their playgrounds with the program (equipment and supervision) but they cannot say which part of the program makes the difference,” he said, adding that playground renovation does tend to be expensive. . “Whether it is worth the time and money for schools to renovate their playgrounds will of course be driven by the needs and wealth of individual communities,” Anthamatten said. .

Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A lethal strain of bird flu has infected an eighth turkey flock in Minnesota, the nation’s top turkey producer, in just over a month, officials said on Tuesday, a day after a team of epidemiologists arrived to investigate how the disease is spreading. . Minnesota has detected five cases of the H5N2 flu, which can kill nearly an entire flock of poultry within 48 hours, in commercial turkey flocks since Thursday alone.  . Commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks in states ranging from Arkansas to Washington also have been infected with the deadly strain since the beginning of the year, triggering overseas buyers to limit imports of U.S. poultry from companies like Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. . On Tuesday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Japan and Taiwan imposed trade restrictions on poultry from Ontario after bird flu was confirmed in the province. . The latest U.S. infection of the H5N2 flu was the second case in two days to be found in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The county, located west of Minneapolis, is the state’s top turkey-producing county. . On Monday, a team of USDA epidemiologists arrived in Minnesota to investigate how the virus is making its way into turkey flocks, said Erica Gunderson, spokeswoman for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. State officials asked the U.S. government to send the team because they needed help responding to the increasing number of infections, she added. . “Basically, we just needed more people,” she said. . The USDA has said it believes migratory ducks are spreading the flu, but does not know exactly how the virus is moving into poultry flocks from wild birds. . The latest infected flock of 30,000 turkeys in Minnesota will be culled to prevent the virus from spreading, and the birds will not enter the food supply, according to the USDA. In the last week, the number of birds to be culled in the state because of the flu has topped 180,000. . Farmers in Minnesota raise about 46 million turkeys a year, accounting for more than $600 million in income, according to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. Nationwide, farmers raised about 240 million turkeys in 2013, according to the USDA. . So far, no human infections of the bird flu have been detected. |Tue Apr 07 22:12:22 +0000 2015||Minnesota bird flu cases rise as U.S. investigators arrive |5.855658059595899e+17|http://reut.rs/1CkEiXh
Roxanne Nelson|(Reuters Health) - People with a high sense of purpose in life have a lower risk of stroke, according to new research.  . “We and others have shown that purpose in life is protective against multiple adverse health outcomes in older age,” said lead study author Lei Yu, an assistant professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. . Importantly, purpose in life may be improved through changes in behaviors or participation in activities like volunteerism, among other things, Yu told Reuter’s Health in an email. . A stroke can occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked. The damaged brain tissue may contribute to a number of conditions including dementia, movement problems, disability and death as individuals grow older. . For their study, published in the journal Stroke, Yu and his team analyzed autopsy results on 453 older adults who had been enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. All of the participants underwent annual physical and psychological evaluations, including a standard assessment of purpose in life, and were followed until they died, at an average age of 90.  . None of the participants had dementia when they entered the study, but 114 people had suffered a stroke.  . At autopsy, 154 individuals had macroscopic infarctions (areas of stroke damage visible to the naked eye) and 128 had “microinfarcts” (areas of damage visible with a microscope). . Purpose in life was judged on a five-point scale with higher scores indicating a greater purpose. The average score was 3.5.  . With every one-point increase in the score measuring purpose, the likelihood of having one or more macroscopic infarctions decreased by about 50 percent. There was no link between purpose and microinfarcts. . This study is very well done, thorough and very intriguing, said Dr. Jose Biller, chair of neurology at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.  . “It has many strengths and corroborates with other observations that having a direction and purpose in life may be beneficial,” Biller, who wasn’t involved in the new study, told Reuters Health in an interview. . Biller noted that the neurobiology underlying this finding is poorly understood and perhaps more complex than we can understand. . “We are always talking about sickness and infirmity and we don’t emphasize health,” Biller said. “As a country we spend more on healthcare than anyone else but we don’t pay attention to prevention. Many problems can be solved by very basic measures, and as this study shows, that includes taking care of the spirit.” . He cautioned that the people in the new study tended to be highly educated, which means the results may not be applicable to everyone. . “But still, if we put everything together - my opinion is that having a purpose in life is very healthy, and this is the message I would want to convey,” Biller said. . Yu said it’s important for people to be thoughtful about what motivates them. They should engage in rewarding behaviors, he said. . “Health conscious adults are encouraged to work actively to improve their sense of meaning in life and goal directness,” Yu said. . SOURCE: .

Rod Nickel|WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Japan and Taiwan have imposed trade restrictions on poultry and poultry products from Ontario, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Tuesday, a day after bird flu was confirmed in the Canadian province. . The government agency said a turkey farm near Woodstock, Ontario, was under quarantine after the presence of H5 avian influenza was confirmed there on Monday. It said seven other farms nearby were also under quarantine. . About 7,500 birds have died at the first farm, and the remaining 4,500 in the infected barn are scheduled to be killed on Wednesday. . Ontario is Canada’s biggest turkey-producing province. . Avian flu was detected in December in the western province of British Columbia and has spread to numerous U.S. states, from Minnesota to California. . CFIA vice-president of policy and programs Paul Mayers said the agency was testing to confirm the subtype and pathogenicity of the Ontario virus, with results expected within days. . Taiwan and Japan are small markets for Canada, totalling about C$9 million ($7 million) in sales last year. But trade restrictions also remain in place from 10 other countries over the British Columbia outbreak, including Australia and Brazil. . Bird flu’s spread has not affected sales at Maple Leaf Foods, which processes poultry in Ontario mainly for domestic use, spokesman Dave Bauer said. |Tue Apr 07 21:04:53 +0000 2015||Taiwan, Japan ban Ontario poultry over Canada bird flu |5.85548824128684e+17|http://reut.rs/1DgTTMg
|(Reuters) - Denmark’s Novo Nordisk A/S said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted a resubmitted application for its key insulin drug, Tresiba, based on interim analysis data from a clinical trial. . Tresiba, already available outside the United States, was rebuffed by the FDA two years ago on concerns that the drug could be linked to higher rates of heart attacks or strokes. . The agency had asked Novo to conduct a dedicated trial to test for such risks, and the company said on Tuesday that it expects to complete the study in the second half of 2016. . When Novo said in late March that it was looking to resubmit the marketing application for Tresiba and a related drug, industry analysts had estimated Tresiba could get approved as early as October this year, based on the interim data. . Had Novo waited to weave in the results from the full trial in its application, Tresiba would likely not have hit the U.S. market in 2016, putting the world’s top insulin maker behind its main rival Sanofi. . A U.S. launch within the next year may help Tresiba see off rival products, most notably Sanofi’s Toujeo, designed to succeed the French drugmaker’s blockbuster drug, Lantus. . Tresiba, a long-acting form of insulin known chemically as degludec, is currently forecast to generate annual sales of $2.2 billion by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis. . Tresiba also gives Novo an important foundation for future combination regimens in the United States, which accounts for slightly more than half of a $23 billion global diabetes market, Morningstar’s Karen Andersen said in note in March. . Novo Chairman Göran Ando had told Reuters in March last year that getting Tresiba approved by the FDA was one of the most important short-term goals for the company. . The company’s U.S.-listed shares were little changed in extended trade on Tuesday. |Tue Apr 07 20:31:14 +0000 2015||FDA accepts Novo Nordisk's resubmitted application for insulin drug |5.855403582280704e+17|http://reut.rs/1CkhlDC
Anne Harding|NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People with type 2 diabetes may have less depression and fewer hunger pains if they opt for a big breakfast and lunch rather than six smaller meals throughout the day, suggests a new study. . “Eating large breakfasts and lunches may be more beneficial than the usual snacking model,” said Dr. Hana Kahleova, the study’s lead author from the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague. . “However, further larger-scale, long-term studies are needed before offering clear recommendations,” she told Reuters Health in an email. . The analysis used data from a previous study that compared two restricted-calorie diets in 54 people with type 2 diabetes. Each study participant spent 12 weeks eating six small meals a day, and then another 12 weeks eating a large breakfast and lunch, with no dinner. . With both diets, people reported fewer depressive symptoms and better quality of life compared to how they felt at the beginning of the study, but the improvements in mood were significantly greater when they ate larger meals twice a day.  . Disinhibition, which is the tendency to overeat in certain situations, improved more on the two-meal diet. People also reported feeling less hungry when they ate just twice a day, researchers reported in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. . People who eat less frequently may feel fuller and more satisfied when they do eat, rather than feeling hungry all day long from eating small meals, said Kahleova, who added that people need to eat 30 to 40 grams of fiber per day to be successful. . “Eat a hearty breakfast: eat breakfast like a king, lunch as a prince and dinner as a pauper,” she said. “If you feel hungry in the evening you can have a vegetable salad.” . “I think it’s fascinating research,” said Margaret Powers of the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet in Minneapolis in a telephone interview. . By looking at the effect of eating patterns on patients’ depressive symptoms, the new research is starting to take into account the “big emotional component to eating,” said Powers, who wasn’t involved with the new study but is president-elect of healthcare and education for the American Diabetes Association. . The most important thing for people with type 2 diabetes is to have a plan in terms of when they eat and how they spread out their intake of carbohydrates throughout the day, Powers said, adding that the goal is to maintain steady blood sugar levels and a healthy weight. . “There’s no one right way or wrong way, but I think this says that we do have to pay attention to this emotional side of eating,” she said. “If somebody’s eating two large meals a day and they want to eat at other times and they can’t and that’s making them miserable, that’s not the right plan.” . Powers said she wants to see her patients eat a healthy balance and variety of foods.  . “One of the goals of nutrition therapy for diabetes is actually to maintain the enjoyment of food,” she said. “Our goal is to help a patient understand that his or herself so they can help find the best self-management plan . . . Whatever the food plan is, it should be a lifelong eating pattern.” . SOURCE: .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Viagra is the most effective treatment for erectile dysfunction, but it also has a higher rate of side effects than other options, according to an analysis of more than 150 trials. . Viagra is known generically as sildenafil. Men concerned about possible side effects of Viagra like headaches, flushing, indigestion and nasal congestion may want to start on Cialis, which is known generically as tadalafil, researchers report in European Urology. If that’s not effective, men in some countries can try Zydena (udenafil). . Many men have trouble getting or keeping an erection, especially as they age, but erectile dysfunction – also known as ED - is not a natural part of aging, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. . The new review compares seven common ED therapies, all belonging to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i’s). They work by inhibiting an enzyme that may reduce the potency of an erection. . Viagra, Cialis, Levitra (vardenafil) and Stendra (avanafil) all work this way and are approved for use in the U.S. The additional drugs Zydena, Helleva (lodenafil) and Mvix (mirodenafil) are only approved for use in other countries. . PDE5i’s are considered the first-choice therapy for ED, but they’re only effective for 60 to 80 percent of men who try them, and many will stop taking them, according to Dr. Alexander W. Pastuszak of Baylor College of Medicine’s urology department in Houston, Texas. He was not part of the new study. . Researchers at the University of Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands reviewed 82 studies of the drugs’ effectiveness and 72 studies exploring side effects. . These treatments are all more effective than placebo for treating erectile dysfunction, and are generally safe and well tolerated, the authors note. . A 50- or 100-milligram (mg) dose of Viagra appeared to be the most effective treatment. It performed about 50 percent better than a placebo. Smaller doses were less effective. Stendra, in doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg, was among the least effective - only 20 to 30 percent more effective than a placebo. . The 50-milligram dose of Stendra was associated with the lowest rate of side effects of any medication - 8.5 percent of the time. A 20-mg dose of Levitra had the highest rate of side effects: 25 percent. Higher doses of Viagra and Cialis tended to cause side effects between 21 and 22 percent of the time. . “Viagra has an established efficacy and safety profile and remains an important treatment option for men with erectile dysfunction,” a spokesperson for Pfizer, makers of the drug, told Reuters Health in a statement. “Viagra has been studied for more than 15 years in more than 136 completed and ongoing clinical trials involving more than 23,000 men with ED.” . Side effects depend on which drug is used and what other enzymes the drug is able to inhibit, Pastuszak told Reuters Health by email. One of the main side effects of Viagra is visual changes, whereas Cialis more often causes muscle pain. . More generally, these types of ED drugs can cause a drop in blood pressure, because they are vasodilators, which open blood vessels, he said. He added that they should not be used with nitrate-based heart medications since they can cause a steep drop in blood pressure. . “Other common side effects include facial flushing, congestion, headache, and upset stomach,” Pastuszak said. . “Men complain of side effects, but more often of a lack of complete efficacy,” he said. “The drugs are not for everyone, as they won’t necessarily help a man with severe erectile dysfunction as much as they would someone with mild or moderate ED.” . Urologists will already have an understanding of the effectiveness and side effects of the available ED therapies, so the new results will not be a surprise, he said.  . Only Cialis is to be taken daily, the other options are all short-acting, so men have the option of trying several to see which one works well, he said. . Doctors should carefully discuss expectations and treatment effects of the various options with patients before choosing a therapy, the authors write. Some ED patients may want immediate stronger efficacy at the cost of higher side effects, while others may not. . SOURCE: .

|KENEMA, Sierra Leone (Reuters) - Sierra Leone said on Tuesday that it had mistakenly reported an Ebola positive case in Kailahun, a former hotspot for the virus which has not seen a case for nearly four months. . A nine-month-old baby was pronounced Ebola positive last week but was later found to have died from other causes, according to National Ebola Response Centre spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis.  . He blamed the mistake on a “lapse” by health officials who took the blood sample from the corpse. . Kailahun, which borders Guinea, was the first district in Sierra Leone to report a case of the hemorrhagic fever last May and at its peak recorded around 80 cases a week.  . Nearly 3,800 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone as a whole but numbers are falling as steps to control the disease take hold. . Kailahun district council chairman Alex Bonapha said the false test result had resulted in deaths at a local clinic where medical staff were quarantined as a precaution, “leaving the patients without care”. |Tue Apr 07 17:28:36 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone says Kailahun Ebola case report was mistaken |5.85494395148968e+17|http://reut.rs/1CjpTKK
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - When hospitalized patients list nonrelatives as next of kin, state laws might interfere with those patients’ wishes – and a new study suggests the situation isn’t rare. . In Connecticut, where researchers looked at medical charts of nearly 110,000 hospitalized veterans, eight percent had specified someone other than a close family member as next of kin – in conflict with the state’s “default surrogate consent” laws. . Default surrogate consent statutes are designed to designate a proxy for patients who can’t make their own medical decisions. In most states, spouses are given first priority, followed by adult children, parents and siblings, the authors write in a research letter in JAMA.  . But states are inconsistent in their recognition of other relationships, like friends, distant relatives or unmarried or same-sex partners. . In the Connecticut study, unrelated designees noted in patients’ charts included “baby momma,” “common law spouse,” “live-in soul mate,” and “same-sex partner.”   . Same-sex partners are almost never included in state statues, said Thaddeus Pope, director of the Health Law Institute at Hamline University School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In most states, an estranged sister would be appointed proxy before a same-sex partner. . Filling out an advanced directive care plan, which can be done easily online, would avoid the problem, but most people still do not do this, said Pope. (See Reuters story of April 16, 2014 here: . ).  . “The key piece of advice is to complete an advanced directive,” Pope, who wasn’t involved in the new study, told Reuters Health by phone. “Appoint whoever you trust, who knows you and your values and preferences, and give them a copy.” . “There’s a good chance that the person the state is going to pick for you is not the same person that you would pick,” he said. . Appointing a healthcare proxy or durable power of attorney may take more legal resources, but would also prevent confusion, said Dr. Andrew B. Cohen of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who led the new study. . Cohen and his colleagues examined the next-of-kin relationships listed for 109,803 veterans who received care at Veterans Health Administration facilities in Connecticut between 2003 and 2013. . Almost 93 percent listed a nuclear or immediate family member as next of kin. About 3 percent listed a more distant relative and 4 percent listed a person with no blood or legal relation, often a friend, common law spouse or same sex partner. . Less than 1 percent listed other social connections, like landlady, priest, roommate or sponsor. . Six percent of veterans over age 65 and about 9 percent of those under age 65 had someone other than a nuclear family member listed as next of kin. . It is possible that a next of kin could be denied the right to make medical decisions for an incapacitated loved one if they are not recognized by state law, Cohen said, but he suspects it is not happening often. . “When it’s somebody who falls outside the nuclear family it may get in the way of timely clinical care,” Cohen told Reuters Health by phone. . “Whenever somebody’s not able to make their own decisions, that’s really complicated clinically,” Cohen said. “When there’s uncertainty about whether the person who is appointed as next of kin can do this, it slows down the decision making process.” . There will always be emergency situations where no proxy has been appointed beforehand, so a default state list is still necessary, according to Gina Bravo of the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada, who was not involved in the new study. . “We can understand that health professionals need a sort of order of who to call,” Bravo told Reuters Health by phone.  . Quebec has a similar default consent statute, but does include a category for a person who shows special interest who is not a blood or legal relative, she said. Adding this category to U.S. statues would solve part of the problem, she said. . The choice should not be left to the doctor, who has a conflict of interest when it comes to giving or refraining from treatment, she said. . SOURCE: .

|(Reuters) - Hospira Inc, which agreed in February to be bought by Pfizer Inc, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had sent it another warning letter detailing violations in standard drug manufacturing practices at one of its facilities. . The FDA said its inspectors had visited the company’s plant in Liscate, Italy twice in May last year and identified significant violations, including a failure to establish procedures to prevent contamination and to thoroughly investigate instances where a batch did not meet specifications. . Hospira’s response to the FDA’s concerns lacked “sufficient corrective actions”, the agency said. . The letter, dated March 31, does not restrict the production or shipment of pharmaceutical products from the facility, Hospira said on Tuesday. . However, the FDA warned in its letter that it could withhold approval of new applications or supplements made by Hospira until it confirmed that the facility was FDA-compliant. . The company, which makes biosimilars and generic versions of injectable drugs as well as pumps used to deliver them, has received warning letters for multiple facilities and has also issued a slew of drug recalls in the past year. . The company’s stock was down marginally at $87.76 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. .

Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it is concerned that a Swedish Match AB proposal to soften warnings on its snus smokeless tobacco products would not accurately reflect the risks associated with snus use. . Stockholm-based Swedish Match is seeking FDA approval of language stating that its snus products are less risky than cigarettes. It also wants to remove warnings about mouth cancer, gum disease and tooth loss, saying there is no evidence snus causes these diseases. . In a preliminary review of the company’s application on the FDA website, the agency said there was no evidence of an association between snus and lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. . But it said it had concerns about the company’s proposed warning which states: “No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes.” . The agency said it is particularly concerned “with respect to whether it adequately reflects the health risks of using snus” and said a number of studies found associations between snus and pancreatic cancer, heart attacks, stroke and diabetes. . Snus is a moist smokeless tobacco product that users place underneath the upper lip. It typically comes in small pouches and does not involve chewing or spitting. . Outside advisors to the FDA will meet on April 9-10 to discuss Swedish Match’s application and make recommendations. The agency is not bound by the advice of its advisory panels but typically follows it. . The cigarette and electronic cigarette industries, some of which are also developing modified risk products, are closely watching the progress of the Swedish Match application, the first of its kind to be reviewed by the FDA since it gained authority to regulate tobacco in 2009. . Advocates of approval argue that any possible health risks associated with snus pale in comparison with those associated with smoking. . Snus is now Sweden’s most popular tobacco product, while Sweden’s smoking rates are the lowest in Europe. Swedish Match and some researchers attribute much of the decline to smokers switching to snus. . The FDA questioned whether the Swedish experience would be replicated in the United States. It also questioned whether the products Swedish Match sells in the United States are as low in harmful or potentially harmful constituents as those it sells in Sweden. . Companies seeking modified risk approval must show their product reduces the risk of disease for individual tobacco users and benefits the health of the population as a whole including non-tobacco users. .

Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than two years after U.S. health regulators discovered an amphetamine-like stimulant in dietary supplements containing Acacia rigidula, products containing the substance remain on the market, a study has found. . The study, published in the journal Drug Testing and Analysis and made public on Tuesday, found the stimulant beta-methylphenylethylamine, or BMPEA, in more than half of 21 brands of Acacia rigidula supplements purchased a year after the discovery by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The study and preparation of the report took another year. . The products tested were marketed for weight loss, athletic performance and to improve brain function, the researchers said.  BMPEA has been shown to raise blood pressure and heart rates in dogs and cats but has not been studied in humans. It is classified as a doping agent by the World Anti-Doping Agency because it is closely related to amphetamine.  . An FDA spokeswoman, JuliAnn Putnam, said the agency’s “first priority” is to ensure dietary supplements are safe and that “our review of the available information on products containing BMPEA does not identify a specific safety concern at this time.” . She said the FDA “will consider taking regulatory action, as appropriate, to protect consumers.” . Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and lead author on the study, said the FDA should warn consumers immediately about BMPEA and take action to eliminate it from dietary supplements. . “Let’s not wait until we have a body count,” he said. “Just get the job done.” . BMPEA is the latest in a series of amphetamine-like stimulants that have appeared in supplements. Cohen said Acacia rigidula, a shrub that is native to Texas, does not naturally contain BMPEA. . The FDA began investigating the product after a study in the late 1990s suggested there could be trace amounts of amphetamine in the plant, Cohen said. The agency found no amphetamine and no BMPEA in the plant itself but high levels of synthetic BMPEA. . “Acacia rigidula is code in the industry for a potent synthetic stimulant,” he added. “They are using the name as a cover.” . The FDA has tried in the past to keep dangerous stimulants out of supplements. In 2004 it banned the stimulant Ephedra after a decade-long struggle. It subsequently moved to eliminate supplements containing DMAA, a different stimulant also known as 1,3-dimethylamylamine, methylhexanamine or geranium extract. . Now BMPEA is in the spotlight. . Just last week Norcross, Georgia-based Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, a leading maker of Acacia rigidula supplements, issued a press release trumpeting its Thermo-RX product, which it claimed “is a quantum leap on the field of weight loss backed by a clinical study”. . Companies “have searched high and low” to find an alternative to ephedrine for their weight loss products, the company added. “Acadia Rigidula is not only such an alternative, but it may actually be superior to ephedra.” . In November 2013, the FDA seized $2 million in Hi-Tech made products containing DMAA. The company said it has simply switched to using Acacia rigidula.  . “Acacia rigidula is just the answer the diet industry has been waiting on for years,” the company said.  . Hi-Tech said its products are sold through major retailers across the United States.  . Last year European regulators ruled that products containing Acacia rigidula could not be legally marketed since they have not been evaluated or authorized. Any company that wants to sell a product containing Acacia rigidula in Europe must demonstrate that it does not present a risk to, or mislead, the consumer. . In December Canadian health regulators ordered the recall of a bodybuilding product called Jetfuel Superburn because it contained amphetamine-like substances, including BMPEA. |Tue Apr 07 13:29:50 +0000 2015||Acacia rigidula supplements still containing stimulant found on market |5.854343090724127e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dfs4UJ
Jim Drury|A robotic glove designed to help stroke sufferers regain movement in their hands and rebuild their muscles has been developed as part of a collaborative project in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. . The device is called SCRIPT (Supervised Care and Rehabilitation Involving Personal Tele-robotics), and has been developed by researchers at the University of Hertfordshire and a team of European partners. . SCRIPT has been designed to facilitate repetitive movement and exercise of the hand and wrist of patients, both within the chronic stage of illness and after they have been released from hospital. The gloves are fitted with sensors that allow patients’ progress to be monitored and assessed by both patient and therapist. . Thirty-four volunteers have been tested using the glove in tandem with specially-designed computer games, and results have proved encouraging. Double stroke survivor Shani Shamah, a former financial services worker, wasn’t one of those involved, but she has twice used the device to help provide feedback to SCRIPT co-ordinator Dr Farshid Amirabdollahian, who devised the glove. . Shamah was not expected to survive her injuries after a second stroke within a matter of days in April 2013 left her with bleeding on the brain. “I lost my speech, I lost the use of the whole of my left side, leg, arm, shoulder, hand, and through intensive physio in a special rehab unit I was re-taught to walk and to use my arm and hand, although I didn’t have the advantage of having the equipment we’ve been showing here today,” said Shamah. . A stroke can force the sufferer’s hand into a semi-permanent clenched posture, with a flexed wrist. The project aims to counteract such injuries by providing patients with repetitive, fun, exercises performed while wearing the glove. . “The hand and wrist are in an abnormal position, the hand is fully closed, and the wrist is flexed, and what we want to do is to open the hand and extend the wrist, so that people can regain a normal posture of the hand and wrist and then they can practise the therapy,” he said. “The glove that we designed provides some offset forces, so the fingers are pulled open and the wrist is pulled into full extension. With this in mind then people can start practising without those abnormal movements that are forcing the hand closed.” . The device records the patient’s performance and sends this to a therapist, enabling them to tailor treatment remotely. It also frees up a therapist to treat multiple patients, while allowing recovering sufferers to rehabilitate themselves in the comfort of their own home, with the aim of increasing their time spent on rehabilitation. . According to Naila Rahman, SCRIPT integrator, “the advantage of remote monitoring of the user’s use of the system is that it allows the user to train in their own time. The trainer can train first thing in the morning, late in the evening when they come home from work basically, and they’re not tied up to the therapist’s availability.” . Amirabdollahian is an expert in rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies and an associate professor in adaptive systems at the university. He says that in addition to the benefits of patients using the glove at home, the remote assessment of computerized data by therapists allows treatment to be easily individualized. . “This adaptivity is a very important function because it allows us to have the system usable by people with severe stroke but also people with moderate and less moderate stroke,” he added. . Shamah recommends the therapy for stroke survivors like herself, and says it is far more interesting than the often boring exercises she endured on her own road to recovery. . “I think it would be great, it really would be. I’m only sorry I didn’t have the advantage of having this when I was rehab,” said Shamah. “It’s very boring when you just sit at a table and take out a ball from a box and put it down on the table next to you, and playing with theraputty, rolling it backwards and forwards, whereas here you can actually see like with the fruit game you could pick up the fruit, put it in the basket, and that can be quite an achievement. So I think for general use it would be brilliant, for therapy use.” . The prototype was developed as part of a 4.6 million euro (4.9 million USD) project undertaken by the University of Herts team, alongside project partners R.U. Robots Limited, the University of Sheffield, Twente University, Roessingh Research and Development BV, MOOG BV, San Raffaele S.p.A, and User Interface Design GMBH. It was part-funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme. . Amirabdollahian says outside investment is needed in order for the final design to be ready within two years, and at a cost of less than 10,000 USD per glove it will be an affordable healthcare option for public hospitals.|Tue Apr 07 12:11:02 +0000 2015||Robotic glove could help stroke survivors |5.854144782353121e+17|http://reut.rs/1DfgxET
Kieran Guilbert|OSLO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When submarine captain John Remø received a call from his wife to ask about a bag of women’s clothes she had discovered in the cellar of their home, he feared his secret would end his career.  . It was a secret the Norwegian naval officer, then in his late twenties and on duty in the Barents Sea at the height of the Cold War, dared not reveal over a military line. . That night Remø wrote to his wife, and shared the burden he had kept to himself for as long as he could remember. . “I knew at the age of four that I was a girl, not the boy that I was born as,” Remø said. “But I had to be tough, fight and act like a boy. I didn’t like it, yet I had a role to play.” . It was an act that Remø kept up until five years ago, when having just turned 60, the former captain decided to start living openly as a woman and be recognized as transgender.  . Amnesty International estimates as many as 1.5 million people across Europe are transgender, a term used to describe men and women who feel they have been born into the wrong body. . While many European countries are becoming more accepting of transgender people, there is still a long way to go before they are granted equal legal rights, campaigners say. . Norway is often ranked as one of the world’s most progressive nations when it comes to human rights.  . Yet it is one of 19 European countries, including France, Belgium and Italy, that require transgender people to undergo genital removal surgery and sterilization before they can legally change gender, according to human rights organization Transgender Europe (TGEU). . Sitting in her apartment in Oslo, Remø, who goes by the name John Jeanette to highlight the legal plight of transgender people in Norway, is adamant that changing one’s legal gender should not be dependent upon medical intervention.  . “I refuse to be operated on to be recognized as who I am,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . In many European countries like Norway, the requirement of sterilization, known in the Nordic nation as a ‘real sex conversion’, is based on an administrative practice from the 1970s, and has no legal basis. . “Some insist that sterilization is necessary because it proves that people are serious about changing gender,” said Richard Köhler, senior policy officer at TGEU.  . “There is also the belief that if someone, who is legally a man, became pregnant and gave birth to a child, this could be a threat to social order and shake up basic perceptions of gender,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. . Not all countries in Europe require sterilization or surgery in order to legally change gender. . However, the majority, including Germany, Spain and Britain, demand a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria or transsexualism, which is classified as a mental illness by the World Health Organization (WHO).  . The WHO plans to declassify transsexualism - defined as discomfort with the body a person is born with and a desire to live as the opposite sex - as a mental illness, which activists say results in stigmatization of transgender people worldwide.  . Transgender people also tend to face greater levels of discrimination and violence than lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities because gender identity is often poorly understood compared to sexual orientation, campaigners say. . In Europe, transgender people are twice as likely as gay people to be attacked, threatened or insulted, according to a European Union report published in December 2014. . From going to the library and visiting the doctor to picking up a parcel or boarding a plane or train, everyday tasks can prove publicly humiliating for transgender people when their documents do not match their gender identity. .  The medical process for transgender people seeking state-funded treatment to change legal gender can take up to a decade in Norway, according to transgender activist Luca Dalen Espseth.  . Yet the majority of those who want to take hormones or have surgery are denied the required diagnosis of transsexualism from healthcare professionals, who often treat transgender people with hostility and suspicion, he said. . At the Oslo office of LGBT organization LLH, Espseth recalls his visits to the Oslo University Hospital, the only facility in Norway where transgender people can receive medical treatment.   . “The doctors addressed me as female, doubted my history and identity, and asked very intrusive questions about my sex life,” Espseth, 28, who was born female and transitioned to a man in his early twenties, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . Espseth went through eight appointments in one year at the hospital before he received the diagnosis of transsexualism that allowed him to receive the hormone treatment he desired, although like Remø, he refuses to be sterilized. . “I feel like I’m deprived of my right to legal gender recognition just because I choose to exercise my right to refuse medical treatments,” he said.  . “Why should someone else determine our identity?”  . Despite the struggle to change legal gender in Europe, campaigners say transgender rights are gaining more attention.     . “Five years ago we had to explain to most policy makers what being transgender meant, now it is about how to enact change and improve trans rights,” said Evelyne Paradis, executive director of ILGA-Europe, a network of European LGBT groups. . Malta last week became only the second European nation, after Denmark, to allow transgender people to change legal gender without medical intervention, and Köhler from TGEU hopes this will influence other countries to follow suit. . “Rule of law is vital, it sends a message to trans people as to whether they’re seen as equal citizens or seen as backward and needing to be protected from themselves,” he said. “But laws can only go so far, to change mentalities takes time.” . In Norway, expert groups have been set up to assess whether the requirement of sterilization should be removed and consider what criteria should apply to change legal gender status. They will deliver their findings to the government this month.  . Having waited her whole life to be recognised as a woman, Remø is hopeful a new law will be passed this year, allowing transgender people to determine their own identity.  . “It would give so many transgender people, who are still in the closet, the confidence to come out and be themselves,” she said.  .

|(Reuters) - Preliminary testing by the province of Ontario has confirmed the presence of H5 avian influenza on a turkey farm near Woodstock, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Monday.  . The CFIA said it has placed the farm and a neighboring farm on quarantine to control the disease, adding that the industry sector had been notified to adopt biosecurity practices. . The agency said it was conducting further tests to determine the severity of the disease and the subtype and strain of the virus.  . Initial tests for the disease were conducted last week after the farm reported sudden deaths of birds over several days.  . Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease of birds. Most bird flu viruses do not infect humans or pose a food safety risk when poultry products are properly handled and cooked. . Thousands of turkeys and chickens were killed by avian influenza on two farms in British Columbia, Canada, the CFIA had said last December. . The U.S. Department of Agriculture said earlier on Monday that Minnesota, its top turkey-producing state, had found two commercial turkey flocks to be infected with a lethal strain of avian flu. . The CFIA said all birds in the infected zone will be culled.  |Tue Apr 07 00:37:31 +0000 2015||Bird flu confirmed on turkey farm in Woodstock, Ontario |5.852399499072594e+17|http://reut.rs/1CexFFQ
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - For nursing home residents, surgery to improve blood flow to the legs yields only limited improvements in mobility, according to a new study. . Knowing that so-called lower extremity revascularization may not improve mobility allows doctors, patients and families to have more realistic discussions about outcomes of the operation, said Dr. Emily Finlayson, the study’s senior author from the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. . “I think the importance of the study is that people can be sanguine of the benefits of this operation in this population,” said Finlayson. . The nearly 11,000 nursing home residents in the study had a problem called peripheral artery disease, which results when arteries in the legs are clogged and blood flow is reduced. Pain, trouble walking, poor wound healing, and even gangrene can result. . To treat the condition, the residents underwent lower extremity revascularization between 2005 and 2009, at an average age of 82. Surgeons replaced or reopened their leg arteries with a small balloon to improve blood flow. . Before surgery, three quarters of the residents could not walk, and 40 percent had experienced a decline in overall function, the authors reported in JAMA Internal Medicine. . A year after surgery, more than half the people had died. Rates of death or immobility were 63 percent among patients who were able to walk before the operation, and 89 percent among those who couldn’t walk before surgery.  . Also at one year, a third had a steady decline in function. . Being 80 years old or older, having cognitive impairment, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, needing emergency surgery, not being able to walk before surgery or declining activities of daily living were each tied to an increased risk of dying or not being able to walk after lower extremity revascularization, the researchers write. . By traditional measures, such as the ability to walk, the surgeries were largely unsuccessful, said Finlayson. But she said the results should be interpreted with caution. . “You have to back up and think of the other potential goals of the operation,” she said. . For example, the goal of the operation may be to relieve severe pain in a patient who has a limited life expectancy. . As an alternative, some people may do better with skilled wound care, Finlayson said. Or in some cases an amputation may be a better choice. . “These are all things that should be on the table when you’re discussing options to treat this condition in this population,” she said. . In an editorial, Dr. William Hall of the University of Rochester School of Medicine in New York noted that many of the nursing home residents in the study’s dataset could not walk before the surgery. . He wrote that “most of the procedures were probably performed for relief of symptoms secondary to ischemic leg pain, non-healing wounds or worsening gangrene.” . In those cases, the procedure can be viewed as a way to relieve pain or discomfort – not a way to extend life or improve the ability to walk. . Finlayson said the information in the new study can be used to help patient make decisions and receive care that’s in line with their goals. . SOURCE: .  and .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - An updated review of 11 popular commercial diets found that only Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers show evidence for effective long-term weight loss. . Doctors might prioritize these options when talking to patients about commercial weight loss programs, at least until other types of diets, like Nutrisystem or SlimFast, have produced substantial evidence of consistent long-term results, the experts conclude. . “We’re not necessarily excluding any of these programs,” said lead author Dr. Kimberly Gudzune of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. . “We’re trying to highlight the ones that do have the scientific evidence proving that they do work to lose weight and keep it off,” Gudzune told Reuters Health by phone. “For others it is unclear, they may show short term weight loss with no long term results, or in the long term people start to begin to regain the weight.” . Gudzune and her co-authors reviewed evidence in support of Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, Health Management Resources, Medifast, OPTIFAST, Atkins, SlimFast, The Biggest Loser Club, eDiets and Lose It!  . These programs emphasize dietary change or meal replacement and behavioral counseling or social support, but do not necessarily address physical activity. . Gudzune and her team selected 45 dietary trials, including 39 randomized controlled trials comparing the diets to a control group, completed between 2002 and 2014. Many were sponsored by the commercial programs themselves. . In six trials, by the one-year mark, people on Weight Watchers had lost almost three percent more of their initial body weight than did people in control groups. But they did not lose any more weight on average than people in comparison groups who had access to behavioral counseling consultations with providers, which would also encourage weight loss. . Three trials found that people on Jenny Craig had at least 4.9 percent greater weight loss maintained at the one-year point compared with people in a control group or those in a behavioral counseling group. . Three trials found that people using Nutritystem had at least 3.8 percent greater weight loss compared to control or counseling at the three-month point, but no trials continued a full year. . Similarly, programs which require very low calorie intake, like Health Management Resources, Medifast and OPTIFAST, did demonstrate more weight loss after three months than a control or counseling group, but effectiveness seemed to diminish beyond six months, the authors write in the Annals of Internal Medicine. . “While obesity continues to be a significant health risk in the U.S., our program provides the personal support and behavioral strategies that lead to healthy lifestyle change and can provide an effective solution for clinicians,” Monty Sharma, CEO and president of Jenny Craig, told Reuters Health in a statement. “We are gratified that this independent study in a reputable journal has prioritized us as a weight loss solution for patient referrals and that the review showed that Jenny Craig is one of the most effective long-term weight loss solutions.” . Trials of the Atkins diet found between 0.1 and 2.9 percent greater weight loss than counseling after one year, but potential harmful side effects and drop-out rates from the program were rarely reported, the authors write.  . A representative for the Atkins diet disputes these conclusions. . “What the study does show is that any clinician recommending a weight loss program with a cost is going to help people lose weight but at a premium price,” Colette Heimowitz, vice president of nutrition and education at Atkins Nutritionals, told Reuters Health in a statement. “Atkins is 100 percent free and its efficacy is proven with more than 80 independent clinical studies.” . SlimFast trial results were mixed, and there was little evidence for weight outcomes for other programs. . Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig may be among the most effective programs because they are highly structured and often include in-person social support, according to Dr. Christina C. Wee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston. . But weight loss with these programs is modest and likely below patients’ expectations, which may make it harder for patients to stick with, and pay for, the programs long-term, Wee wrote in an editorial accompanying the new results. . “Medically we hope people achieve and sustain 3 to 5 percent weight loss from their starting weight,” and people on Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers did meet that goal, Gudzune noted. . The trials in the review were not designed to pit the diets against each other and determine why one works better than another, she said, but the review should help doctors and patients discuss whether or not a commercial diet program is a good choice, and if so, which one to try.  . In addition to evidence of effectiveness, people should consider varying costs and time commitments, she said.  . “There is no one-size-fits-all solution for this,” Gudzune said. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Physical therapy may work as well as surgery for easing symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, a common cause of nerve damage and lower back pain among older people, a study suggests.  . “Surgery is a riskier procedure, with about a 15 percent complication rate, and half of those are life-threatening,” said Dr. Anthony Delitto, chair of physical therapy at the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. “It isn’t a life-risking procedure to do physical therapy.” . Lumbar spinal stenosis, a compression of open spaces in the lower spinal column, can lead to pinched nerves, tingling, weakness and numbness in the back and the lower extremities. The condition becomes more common with age, and an estimated 2.4 million Americans may have it by 2021, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. . Delitto and colleagues set out to see if they could show that physical therapy, long known to be safer than surgery, could work as well as at easing symptoms. . Between 2000 and 2005, they asked 481 patients who consented to surgery if they would be willing to join a study where they would be randomly chosen to proceed with the operation or receive physical therapy. Most declined, to avoid being assigned to the non surgical group, but 169 patients agreed to participate in the experiment. . Ultimately, 87 patients had surgery and 82 were assigned physical therapy. . At the start of the study, patients were at least 50 years old. They had to be able to walk at least a quarter mile without difficulty and have no underlying medical conditions such as dementia, severe vascular disease, cancer, or a prior heart attack. . Most of them were sedentary or only mildly active, and they were typically obese. Patients in the surgery group were slightly younger, about 67 on average, compared with an average age of about 70 for patients receiving physical therapy. . The physical therapy regimen consisted of twice-weekly rehabilitation sessions for six weeks. Participants were allowed to opt out of this regimen in favor of surgery at any point during the study, and over an average two years of follow-up 47 of them, or 57 percent, did just that. . No matter what group they started in, participants achieved similar reduction of pain and other symptoms at two years. . “The study demonstrates that both surgery and physical therapy are reasonable choices; the person who goes down either path ends up in the same place a year or two later,” said Dr. Jeffrey Katz, director of the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. . Katz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study in Annals of Internal Medicine, noted that there’s still a role for surgery in treating lumbar spinal stenosis. But there’s no harm in trying physical therapy first, he said. . Because so many eligible patients opted not to participate in the study, and so many randomly selected for physical therapy abandoned it to get surgery, more research may still be needed in a larger group of patients to get a complete picture of the relative benefits of each option, said Dr. James Weinstein, chief executive of Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system, who wasn’t involved in the study. . Still, “surgery should be the last option,” said Weinstein, lead author of a 2008 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine that found surgery more effective at curbing symptoms than non surgical alternatives.  . Despite the small size of the current study and the number of patients who stopped physical therapy early, it still makes sense to try it before surgery, said Dr. Richard Deyo, a researcher in back pain at Oregon Health and Science University, in email to Reuters Health. . “If they elect to have surgery at a later time, the results appear to be as good as for patients who choose earlier surgery,” said Deyo, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Some patients are inclined toward surgery because the high tech approach seems more definitive, attractive, and quicker. However, patients should realize they are likely to need physical therapy even after successful surgery, and recovery can be slow.” . SOURCE: .

Caroline Humer|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Payments to health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly and disabled will increase by 1.25 percent in 2016, the U.S. government said on Monday, in response to expected growth in health spending. .     The announcement, by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, comes after the U.S. government  proposed a 0.95 percent cut in payments to insurers in February. . More than 16 million people are enrolled in these plans, in which healthcare benefits are managed by private insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc and Aetna Inc. . Each April the government announces reimbursement rates for insurers. The information helps insurers determine how profitable it will be to sell these plans, which optional benefits to provide and in which regions and markets to compete. . Shares of Humana, which receives about two-thirds of its revenue from Medicare Advantage plans, rose about 1 percent to $180 in after hours trading. UnitedHealth, Aetna and Anthem Inc were mostly unchanged. . The increase comes after many years of cuts to Medicare Advantage payments, because of an overall decline in healthcare spending and changes under the Affordable Care Act that seek to align payments more closely with the government-run Medicare fee-for-service program.  . The increase is larger than expected, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said, and bodes well for insurers that sell these plans next year. . “2016 enrollment growth should be accelerated compared to previous years,” Gupte said. . Some insurers as well as the nation’s largest insurer lobbyist group, America’s Health Insurance Plans, had warned the government that any cuts would hurt the elderly.  . “The final rate notice took a notable step to provide stable funding for the Medicare Advantage program,” AHIP President Karen Ignagni said, adding, however, that the policy did not do enough to protect chronically ill and vulnerable populations. . The increase for 2016 versus the decline announced in February results from expectations of Medicare Advantage spending growth of 4.2 percent, compared with the 1.7 percent the government forecast in February. . The 4.2 percent growth reflects additional spending in 2014 and 2015, as well as higher expected outlays in 2016. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said higher spending was due to hospitalizations, rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. . It also includes a 0.1 percent increase based on the assumption that Congress will enact legislation raising Medicare payments to doctors. . The government also said that it would move forward with changes to how it pays insurers for patients who are sicker than average. It will additionally leave the star ratings systems, which rewards high-performing plans, as planned, and it will tighten oversight of each plan’s pharmacy network and provider networks and directories. . The government policies affect each insurer differently, said Ipsita Smolinski, an analyst with Washington, D.C.-based research firm Capitol Street. . “All of these numbers are averages and the bottom line 2016 impact is going to vary by plan, by location, by star rating and by coding practices,” Smolinski said. |Mon Apr 06 21:14:56 +0000 2015||U.S. regulator says 2016 payments for Medicare Advantage to rise |5.851889670012887e+17|http://reut.rs/1CdHFz0
Karen Freifeld|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of 14 state attorneys general on Thursday asked the U.S. Congress to investigate the herbal supplements industry after a New York probe of the products turned up ingredients that were not listed on labels and raised safety concerns. . The group, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, also asked Congress to consider giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration more oversight of herbal supplements. . “We believe the safety and efficacy of these supplements is a matter of deep public concern across the country,” the attorneys general said in the letter, urging “swift action.” . In February, four major retailers, GNC Holdings Inc, Target Corp, Walgreens and Wal Mart Stores Inc, halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by the New York attorney general. DNA tests had failed to detect plant materials listed on the majority of products tested. . On Monday, GNC reached an agreement with Schneiderman to adopt more stringent testing standards than the FDA requires, and began to resell the supplements. . A study found the products were within FDA guidelines, Schneiderman said. GNC said tests also showed its products were safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance. . The attorneys general sent their letter requesting a probe to Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Pennsylvania Representative Joe Pitts, chairmen of subcommittees on product safety and health. They cited the New York probe and said researchers also have found other problems, including high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic in certain supplements.  . The letter was signed by attorneys general from Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Northern Mariana Islands, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. . The attorneys general asked the subcommittees to work with the FDA to see whether the agency should develop enhanced quality assurance programs and other safety requirements. Currently, the FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of rules than those covering drug products. . Steve Mister, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry group, said the New York attorney general’s investigation was discredited and concerns about “alleged widespread safety issues are not true.” . He said “the industry is already amply regulated on a federal level.” .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - People who order human breast milk online for their babies may end up receiving shipments contaminated with cow’s milk, according to a new study. . Researchers purchased and tested 102 samples of human milk from the Internet. There was enough evidence to suggest 10 samples were contaminated with cow’s milk, which may affect kids with allergies or intolerance, researchers write in the journal Pediatrics. . “When you combine these results with our 2013 study that showed a high level of bacterial contamination in milk bought online, we conclude that milk purchased on the Internet is unsafe,” said Sarah Keim, the study’s lead author from The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. . “You really just don’t know what you’re getting,” Keim wrote in an email to Reuters Health. . In their previous study, the researchers found that about 75 percent of the milk samples were contaminated with disease-causing bacteria like E. coli or harmful levels of bacteria such as Streptococci. . They say the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends against feeding infants human milk from unscreened donors, but the practice of donating or selling human milk on the Internet is growing in popularity. . In their recent study, the researchers tested the DNA of 102 samples sold in 2012 as human milk, for $1 to $2 per ounce.  . All of the samples contained human DNA, but 12 also tested positive for cow DNA. And 10 of those 12 contained what the researchers called a “significant amount” of cow milk products - enough to rule out minor or incidental contamination.  . Human milk contaminated with cow milk may harm babies who are allergic to cow milk proteins, the researcher write. In past research, they found about a fifth of people buying human milk online were doing so for a child with a medical condition – some with formula intolerances. . Keim’s group would like to see research into ways to increase breastfeeding support and improve access to nonprofit milk banks so women don’t have to buy milk on the Internet. . Mothers who have difficulty making enough milk should work with their pediatrician to identify safe, healthy ways to feed their babies, she said. . SOURCE: .

Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) - Taking the financial burden of organ donation off the shoulders of donors and their families is not only more fair, but it might also lead to more organs for transplant, experts say - and they urge Americans to find ethical ways to get rid of financial “disincentives” to organ donation. . In addition to removal of financial barriers, they would also like to see careful consideration and testing of potential financial incentives for organ donation.  . But any changes in current practice must be able to pass tests of both efficacy and ethics, says the 38-member Incentives Workshop Group, comprised of representatives of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. . The group published its recommendations in a paper in the American Journal of Transplantation. . “Every person in the chain of an organ donation, except one, profits,” said Daniel Salomon, an author of the paper and the medical director of the kidney and pancreas transplant program at Scripps Health in San Diego.  . That “one” who doesn’t profit is the donor. According to the American Journal of Nephrology, living donors incur out-of-pocket expenses averaging $5,000. While a recipient’s insurance covers the donor’s medical expenses, it won’t cover transportation, lodging, childcare and lost wages.  . And families of deceased donors may face higher hospital and funeral costs resulting from donation. . “Donor costs should be incorporated into the cost of the transplant,” said Tom Mone, CEO of OneLegacy, the nation’s largest organ procurement organization. “The donor should bear no economic detriment.” . The workshop group maintains that upfront cost coverage would result in drastic and long-term savings among insurers by facilitating organ donation.  . “From every single patient that stays on dialysis, the payer is losing $60,000 a year if they are not transplanted,” Salomon said. According to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, more than 123,000 Americans await organ transplants. Roughly 4,000 die each year.   . But according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the number of living kidney donors in the U.S. has been declining. In 2014, they numbered 5,817.  . While there’s agreement that financial barriers prevent too many potential donors from proceeding with the surgery, incentives are a murky territory. The 1984 National Organ Transplant Act made donor compensation illegal. But other incentives may be effective without interfering with inherent altruism, the authors say. For families of deceased donors, for example, coverage of extra funeral costs could be considered.  . Offering incentives to living donors, however, “is so ethically charged,” said Elisa Gordon, a Northwestern University medical anthropologist and working group member. “We don’t know if that would result in exploitation or undue inducement.”  . “We have a responsibility to living donors,” Salomon said. “But, we basically take their kidney and say goodbye.” He maintains that donors should receive lifetime health coverage, while other working group members have suggested coverage for a certain time.  . Some people fear that such offers may go too far, however. Any harm attributable to living donation, including medical costs and lost wages, should be mitigated, said Mildred Solomon, CEO of The Hastings Center and a Clinical Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School. But lifetime care constitutes a “perverse incentive” in the U.S., she believes.  . “We are the only developed country in the world that doesn’t see healthcare as a universal right,” Solomon said. “What a statement it would be about our society if people decided to give an organ so they could get health insurance.”  . Working group members say a balance should be struck between burdensome donation costs and compensation, and this balance can be identified in careful consideration of other incentives- but not cash. . “The conversations have been too polarized,” said University of Nebraska Medical Center transplant surgeon Alan Langnas, a paper co-author. “When you have those two arguments, nothing happens.”  . Salomon said he anticipates dialogue with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, private insurers and donors who themselves have experienced roadblocks.  . “We need to initiate discussions with a broad group of stakeholders in this country, starting with the patients, families and payers,” Salomon said.   .

|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Minnesota, the top U.S. turkey producing state, has found two more commercial turkey flocks to be infected with a lethal strain of avian flu, including one in a previously established quarantine zone, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday. . The state in the past month has found that H5N2 flu, which can kill nearly all the birds in a flock within 48 hours, has infected seven flocks, according to the USDA. In the last week alone, the number of birds to be culled in Minnesota because of the flu has topped 150,000. . The infected flocks were in the state’s biggest turkey-producing counties. Kandiyohi and Stearns counties were the top two turkey-producing countries in Minnesota in 2012, according to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. . Minnesota’s turkey farmers raise about 46 million birds annually accounting for more than $600 million in income, according to association. Nationwide, farmers raised about 240 million turkeys in 2013, according to the USDA. . Ninety percent of the turkey products processed in state are exported out of Minnesota, and of that 90 percent, 15 percent are exported, the association said. . Recent bird flu infections in states stretching from Arkansas to California have prompted overseas buyers to limit imports of U.S. poultry from companies such as Tyson Foods Inc, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc. . The latest U.S. infection was the third case detected in Stearns County, Minn., which is northwest of Minneapolis. The infected flock of 76,000 turkeys is already in a quarantine zone established because of a previous infection in the county, according to the USDA. The quarantine limits the movement of poultry in and out of the area around an infected flock. . Another new case of H5N2 flu was detected in a flock of 26,000 turkeys in Kandiyohi County, Minn., which is west of Minneapolis. . Both flocks will be culled to prevent the virus from spreading, and the birds will not enter the food supply, according to the USDA.  . Officials believe the flu is likely being spread by waterfowl, but do not know precisely how the virus is making its way into commercial poultry operations. Molecular testing has shown the H5N2 virus is nearly identical to viruses isolated in migratory ducks, according to the USDA. . Wild birds can carry the disease without appearing sick, and the USDA has advised people to avoid contact with sick or dead poultry and wildlife. . So far, no human infections of the virus have been detected. |Mon Apr 06 16:58:05 +0000 2015||Minnesota finds two more turkey flocks infected with lethal bird flu |5.851243283809894e+17|http://reut.rs/1CcnGAJ
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Staying active, even only slightly, confers major longevity benefits, researchers say. . During many years of follow-up, people who did less than the minimum recommended amount of physical activity still had a considerable decrease in risk of death compared to people who did no activity at all, in a new analysis of six studies. . “Our findings support the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which recommend a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week for “substantial” health benefit, and suggest “additional” benefit with more than double the exercise minimum,” said lead author Hannah Arem of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. . Researchers pooled data on more than 660,000 men and women in the U.S. and Europe from previous studies. Half the studies had tracked participants for more than 14 years. Overall, 116,686 deaths were recorded. . Based on self-reports of physical activity, people who did less than the recommended minimum of activity were still 20 percent less likely to die during the studies than people who were not active at all. . Mortality risk was 31 percent lower for people who did one to two times the recommended minimum, and 37 percent lower for those who did two to three times the recommended minimum activity. . Mortality risk seemed to level off at three to five times the recommended minimum amount of exercise, which is equivalent to a weekly minimum of walking 7 hours or running 2 hours 15 minutes, Arem told Reuters Health by email. . But there was no evidence that doing even 10 times the minimum recommended amount would do any harm, the authors write in JAMA Internal Medicine. The results were similar whether the research team analyzed deaths from any cause, or deaths specifically from cardiovascular disease or cancer. . “While we adjusted for known mortality risk factors like body mass index and smoking, we were not able to adjust for diet in this study as we did not have information available in all cohorts,” she said. “However, in previous analyses in these cohorts where information on diet was available, the associations between physical activity and mortality persisted even after they were adjusted for diet.” . The new results largely reinforce existing guidelines, which already state that some activity is better than no activity, according to Todd M. Manini of the University of Florida in Gainesville.  . Manini wrote an editorial accompanying the new findings. . “Getting just a little bit above doing nothing, there was a 20 percent reduction in mortality,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “That was the biggest shift going from one category to another.” . Just one hour of brisk walking or 30 minutes of jogging or biking per week is enough to move into that first category and out of the “inactive” group, he noted. Doing more than the recommended amount didn’t seem to decrease mortality risk much further, but may have many other health benefits beyond just decreasing the risk of death, Manini said. . Volume of activity, rather than intensity, drove longevity benefit in the new findings, Arem said.  . A study of middle-aged and older Australians published in the same issue of JAMA Internal Medicine found that vigorous activity was more strongly linked to a decreased risk of death than moderate intensity activity. . “Future research is needed to determine whether associations between physical activity and mortality differ by specific activities,” Arem said. .

|(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said it would invest in Dutch biotech uniQure NV, joining other big drugmakers who have moved to gain a foothold in the promising gene therapy market. . UniQure’s shares jumped more than 55 percent on Monday after Bristol-Myers said it would pick up a 4.9 percent stake in the company. . UniQure’s gene therapy drug, Glybera, went on sale last year priced at 1.1 million euros. . Glybera fights the ultra-rare genetic disease lipoprotein lipase deficiency, which clogs the blood with fat. . Investor interest in the field of gene therapy has grown in the past 18 months, with Bluebird Bio Inc, uniQure NV and Spark Therapeutics Inc all staging successful floats on the Nasdaq. . Bayer AG struck a gene therapy deal with Dimension Therapeutics in June, while France’s Sanofi SA has a long-standing tie-up with Oxford BioMedica. . Bristol-Myers will invest about $100 million in uniQure, including $33.84 per share, or at least $32 million in total,  for a 4.9 percent stake, the companies said. . The purchase price per share is at a 48 percent premium to uniQure’s Thursday close and values the company at about $595.4 million, based on its outstanding shares as of Feb. 9, according to Thomson Reuters calculations. . Bristol-Myers will acquire an additional 5 percent stake in the Amsterdam-based company before Dec. 31 at a 10 percent premium. [ID:nBw8xgwS2a] . The companies will collaborate on 10 targets, including uniQure’s proprietary gene therapy program for congestive heart failure, S100A1. . UniQure will be responsible for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies, while Bristol-Myers will lead development and regulatory activities and bear all research and development costs. . Bristol-Myers will also be responsible for the commercialization of all products from the collaboration. . UniQure will be eligible for a number of milestone payments, including up to $254 million for its lead S100A1 therapeutic and up to $217 million for each other gene therapy product potentially developed under the deal. . UniQure’s shares were up 45.8 percent at $33.34 in morning trading on the Nasdaq. .

|BEIRUT (Reuters) - Two Syrians died of H1N1 swine flu last month and six others were suspected of carrying the infection, Syria’s state news agency SANA said on Monday. . The World Health Organization has warned that the collapse of Syria’s health system during its four-year civil war has led to the spread of disease. Typhoid, hepatitis and the polio virus have taken hold in the country. . SANA said the two men were from the southern province of Sweida, where government forces and rebels have clashed. Their deaths were reported by the head of Communicable and Chronic Diseases Department in Sweida, it said. . In 2009-10, swine flu spread from central Mexico around the world. Researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that it killed 284,000 people in 12 months. . More than 220,000 people have been killed in Syria’s conflict, which began in March 2011 with popular protests against President Bashar al-Assad and spiraled into civil war after a crackdown by his security forces. |Mon Apr 06 10:17:27 +0000 2015||Two Syrians die from H1N1 swine flu |5.850235061921464e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cav6Vd
|TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel-based DreaMed Diabetes said on Monday it had licensed its artificial pancreas technology for integration into insulin pumps made by Medtronic. . DreaMed will receive undisclosed royalties from future sales of each device using its technology. Medtronic will be responsible for the development and marketing of the pumps. . The U.S. medical device maker has also invested $2 million in DreaMed.   . DreaMed’s GlucoSitter, which is based on the MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas algorithm, is an automated system for controlling glucose levels.  . It analyses the body’s glucose levels and directs the pump to deliver the correct dose of insulin to the body, mimicking the behavior of a healthy pancreas. This minimizes the risk of suffering low and high blood glucose episodes. . “We believe that a fully automated artificial pancreas will provide greater freedom and better health for many people with diabetes by eliminating some of the burden of glucose management,” said Alejandro Galindo, general manager of the intensive insulin management business at Medtronic. . The global market for products to manage diabetes stands at $41 billion and is estimated to surpass $114 billion by 2018. Insulin-dependent patients represent half of this market.  |Mon Apr 06 10:01:42 +0000 2015||DreaMed Diabetes technology to be used in Medtronic insulin pump |5.850195413040087e+17|http://reut.rs/1Car0wg
|PARIS (Reuters) - The second patient to receive an artificial heart made by French firm Carmat is leading a normal life including  physical exercise, eight months after his transplant, the 69-year-old man told weekly Le Journal du Dimanche in an interview. . Carmat is conducting trials of its heart device that is designed as a permanent implant that can extend the life of patients without them having to wait for a human heart donor. . The company’s first transplant patient, a 76-year-old man, died in March last year, two-and-a-half months after his operation. . The second patient, who has asked not to be named, was discharged from hospital in January in western France. . “I have completely recovered. I can walk, I can get up and I can bend down 10 to 15 times a day without any difficulty,” he told the paper in an interview published on Sunday. . “In fact, I have never felt so good,” he said. . The patient, who spoke for two hours without losing his breath according to the newspaper, also said he does repair work at home and physical exercise including shooting and cycling. . The patients chosen for Carmat’s artificial heart trials suffer from terminal heart failure. The company plans to operate on four patients in its trial phase, and it said last year it had made changes following the death of the first patient due to a short circuit in the device. . In an interview published on Friday in western French daily Presse Ocean, Daniel Duveau, one of the surgeons who operated on the second Carmat patient, said the next two transplants should be scheduled in the coming months. |Sun Apr 05 10:57:22 +0000 2015||Second Carmat artificial heart patient 'never felt so good': newspaper |5.846711627577098e+17|http://reut.rs/1C4YYlZ
Jim Forsyth|SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. health officials have warned consumers against eating any products from a Blue Bell Creameries’ Oklahoma ice cream plant, which has temporarily closed because of possible Listeriosis contamination. . On Saturday the Texas grocery chain H-E-B, which is one of the largest retailers of Blue Bell ice cream, announced it was pulling all of the company’s products from its shelves indefinitely in the wake of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warning. . Earlier this month, Kansas health officials said three people died between January 2014 and January 2015 after being sickened by Listeriosis at a hospital where Blue Bell products were served. They were in the hospital for other reasons. . Blue Bell is voluntarily suspending operations at its plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, the company said in a statement. .     “We will thoroughly inspect the facility for any possible problems that may have led to the contamination of some of our ice cream products over the past few weeks,” the company said. . Blue Bell said its other facilities will continue to operate and supply products to retail stores and institutional customers. .     But H-E-B, which has 340 stores, said it will remove all Blue Bell products as a precaution due to food safety concerns, according to company spokeswoman Dya Campos in San Antonio.  .     Blue ​Bell said its two voluntary recalls in the past three weeks are the first in the company’s more than 100-year history. . According to the CDC, Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria. It primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and those with compromised immune systems and can lead to death. |Sun Apr 05 03:11:00 +0000 2015||Listeria fear spreads as Blue Bell closes Oklahoma ice cream plant |5.845537985988116e+17|http://reut.rs/1D5MBLg
|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Morphosys still believes that its MOR202 compound has a good chance of becoming a success after U.S. drugmaker Celgene scrapped cooperation on the drug candidate, the German company’s chief executive told a newspaper. . “We are still testing the MOR202 compound in the first clinical phase and still see it as promising,” German weekly Welt am Sonntag quoted Simon Moroney as saying in an interview published on Sunday. . The compound is viewed as a possible treatment for multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer.  . Morphosys and Celgene agreed last month to end their cooperation on MOR202, pushing Morphosys’ stock down more than 20 percent. . “Investors’ initial reaction is always the same. First everyone thinks that the project is dead if a cooperation fails,” Moroney said. . He said Morphosys would make further decisions on the future of MOR202 once a Phase 1/2a trial of the compound was completed, adding he expected results of the trial to be available by the end of the year. |Sun Apr 05 00:22:17 +0000 2015||Morphosys CEO says MOR202 drug candidate still promising: newspaper |5.845113404018483e+17|http://reut.rs/1D5mRie
Umaru Fofana|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone’s eastern district of Kailahun, once a hotbed of Ebola, has recorded its first case in nearly four months, threatening progress made to stamp out the disease, officials said on Saturday. . A 9-month-old boy tested positive for Ebola after dying in Kailahun, the district on Guinea’s border that recorded Sierra Leone’s first Ebola case last May and was for months the epicenter of the crisis. . Kailahun went from recording up to 80 infections per week in June to zero cases at the end of last year. Nearly 3,800 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone but numbers of weekly cases are falling as steps to control the disease take hold. . However, Winnie Romeril, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organisation, said local and foreign experts had been dispatched to investigate the case after the positive test result. . Kenema and Kono, two other eastern districts, have recorded a handful of cases in recent months but Kailahun’s successes had been cited as examples for other areas to follow. . Alex Bonapha, the Kailahun district council chairman, said it was not clear how the boy may have contracted Ebola as both his parents were healthy. . He said the boy may have gotten the disease during a blood transfusion or there may have been a problem with the sample that was tested. . Sources at the Nixon Hospital in Kailahun District confirmed that the boy underwent a blood transfusion before dying. . “I am aware of the weakness in the health system which means that the blood transfused into the baby could well not have been the blood that had been donated by his uncle,” Bonapha said. . A ministry of health official expressed serious concern over the case, which came as the focus of local and international health officials is on the north and west of the country, the latest areas affected by Ebola.  . Liberia, once the hardest hit of all the countries in West Africa, has detected no Ebola cases after the last confirmed patient died at the end of March. . However, Guinea has imposed a 45-day state of health emergency to tackle a spike of cases in the country where the outbreak was first confirmed last year. . As part of these measures, authorities closed all private medical clinics in Kindia, 135 km (84 miles) from the capital Conakry, after a new case of Ebola was recorded there. . The worst Ebola outbreak on record has now killed nearly 10,500 people, mainly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. .

Emile Picy|PARIS (Reuters) - France will ban excessively thin fashion models and expose modeling agents and the fashion houses that hire them to possible fines and even jail, under a new law passed on Friday. . The move by France, with its fashion and luxury industries worth tens of billions of euros, comes after a similar ban by Israel in 2013, while other countries, like Italy and Spain, rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. . The measure is part of a campaign against anorexia by President Francois Hollande’s government. Lawmakers also made it illegal to condone anorexia and said any re-touched photo that alters the bodily appearance of a model for commercial purposes must carry a message stating it had been manipulated. . “The activity of model is banned for any person whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is lower than levels proposed by health authorities and decreed by the ministers of health and labor,” the legislation says. . The lawmaker behind the bill previously said models would have to present a medical certificate showing a BMI of at least 18, about 55 kg (121 lb) for a height of 1.75 meters (5.7 feet), before being hired for a job and for a few weeks afterwards. . The law, voted through the lower house of parliament by Hollande’s Socialist majority despite opposition by conservative parliamentarians, envisages imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of 75,000 euros ($82,000) for any agency contravening it. . A second measure means that any website inciting a reader to “seek excessive thinness by encouraging eating restrictions for a prolonged period of time, resulting in risk of mortality or damage to health” will face up to a year in prison and fines of up to 100,000 euros. . Elite and IMG, two big modeling agencies present in France, both declined to comment on the moves. . Some 30,000-40,000 people in France suffer from anorexia, most of them teenagers, health experts estimate. . In 2010, Isabelle Caro, an anorexic 28-year-old former French fashion model, died after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness. |Sat Apr 04 12:15:08 +0000 2015||France bans super-skinny models in anorexia clampdown |5.84328343933313e+17|http://reut.rs/1C01OIR
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Fish oil supplements might make cancer chemotherapy less effective - but many people with cancer were taking those supplements in a recent survey. . All six of the fish oil supplements the researchers tested contained a specific fatty acid that’s been found to reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy in mice, the researchers report in JAMA Oncology. . People receiving chemotherapy should refrain from taking fish oil supplements and discuss any supplement with their doctors, said Dr. Emile Voest, the study’s lead author from the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. . “I’m always discussing it with my patients,” he said. “Please have an open relationship with me and tell me what you’re taking.” . He and his colleagues say omega-3 fatty acids are consumed by about a fifth of Americans with cancer – usually through fish oil. Fish oil is often sold in capsules for about $10 or $11 for 100 pills. . The researchers had previously found that even a small amount of two fatty acids reduced the effectiveness of chemotherapy in mice with cancer. These fatty acids may ultimately enable cancer cells to repair themselves faster after chemotherapy, Voest said. . When his team looked for the two fatty acids in six fish oil supplements, one was not detected but the fatty acid called 16:4(n-3) was ubiquitous. . The researchers also surveyed 400 people receiving treatment for cancer in November 2011. Of 118 people who returned the surveys, 35 percent reported using nutritional supplements and 11 percent reported using omega-3 fatty acid supplements. . In another part of the study, the researchers then had 30 volunteers without cancer take 10 or 50 milliliters (mL) of the three fish oil supplements. Levels of 16:4(n-3) peaked in their blood about four hours after taking the 10 mL supplements; levels returned to normal after about eight hours. Levels of the fatty acid remained elevated longer among those taking 50 mL. . Furthermore, when 20 volunteers ate mackerel or herring, levels of 16:4(n-3) in their blood went up. Eating salmon or tuna had little or no effect, however. . The researchers conclude that until more is known, people on chemotherapy should avoid fish oil - and herring and mackerel - the day before and after their treatments.  . They note that the Dutch Cancer Society and the Dutch National Working Group for Oncologic Dieticians recommend that people receiving chemotherapy avoid fish oil around the time of treatment. . “It’s an intriguing observation, which warrants further investigation,” said Dr. Powel Brown, chairman of the Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. . “In general, when giving chemotherapy, we discourage the use of additional supplements,” said Brown, who wasn’t involved with the study. “It’s very well known that some supplements affect the metabolism of chemotherapy.” . Voest said the study’s conclusions are a bit circumstantial, but it would be very difficult to conduct a trial to confirm the findings. For example, it would be unethical to randomly give patients fish oil during chemotherapy to see if it makes their treatment less effective. . People should be cautious about going overboard with avoiding all omega-3 fatty acids, because they’re an essential part of the diet that the body can’t make on its own, said Stacy Kennedy, an expert on oncology nutrition at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. . Flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts are also sources of omega-3 fatty acids. . “I think it’s important to have those detailed conversations with your doctors and dieticians to weigh the risk and benefits of any over-the-counter medication, supplements and powders,” said Kennedy, who also wasn’t involved in the study. .

Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters) - Obese people are better at detecting the scent of chocolate and find it more pleasant than non-obese people, according to a small UK study. . Recent research suggests that smell plays a large role in people’s food intake, as the sense of smell is linked to the hunger center in the brain, the researchers write in Chemical Senses. . “In an era of rising worldwide obesity, we still need to understand more about the role of olfaction in eating behavior,” said lead author Lorenzo Stafford, a senior lecturer at the Center for Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Portsmouth in England. . Previous research has been conflicted over whether obese people have a stronger or weaker sense of taste, but very few studies have looked at the sense of smell, or olfaction, Stafford told Reuters Health in an email. . The research team selected 40 university students for the study and categorized them as either obese or non-obese. All the participants were nonsmokers in good health who were not currently in weight loss programs or taking appetite suppressants.  . Underweight people as well as those with an impaired sense of smell or taste were excluded. . First, the researchers asked students to smell an artificial dark chocolate flavor and rate how intense it was and how pleasant they found the smell. The flavor was then diluted into solutions of different strengths and the participants were tested to determine the lowest concentration they could reliably detect. . The researchers also tested the participants on their sense of taste using the four main flavors: sour, salty, bitter, and sweet. Solutions of each taste were sprayed onto the participants’ tongues and they were asked to identify and rate the strength of each one. . The research team then analyzed the data to determine the relationship between the senses of smell and taste and body weight.  . They found that obese people were better at detecting the chocolate odor than the non-obese group and also rated the odor as more pleasant.  . In addition, the obese participants perceived the salty taste as more salty and the sour taste as more sour than non-obese people. There was no difference between the groups for the bitter and sweet tastes. . The researchers write that smell is significant in eating behavior because it triggers the reward center in the brain. Stafford noted that sensory cues such as sight and smell can increase cravings for addictive substances and theorizes that the same may be true for foods. . He said that the smell of high-calorie foods “might also trigger craving and possibly lead to overconsumption for those individuals prone to weight gain.” . Lucy Donaldson at the University of Nottingham said that while the results seem to show a preference for sweet foods, this could also apply to sweet but low-calorie foods such as fruit. She said more testing is needed to narrow the results. . Donaldson, who was not involved in the study, also noted in an email, “the factors that contribute to eating behavior and obesity are more complex and complicated than just taste or smell perception alone.”  . She added that it is difficult to know if the differences in smell perception are part of what causes obesity or if these differences are caused by obesity. . She recommends that for anyone looking to maintain healthy eating habits, “eating a varied and balanced diet is the healthiest option.” .

Janice Neumann|(Reuters) - A small Australian study finds that grandmothers who take care of their grandchildren one day a week do better on cognitive tests than peers who mind grandkids more often, or not at all. . Researchers say the brain benefits from this form of “grandparenting” may come not just from having social engagement, but “active” engagement in those relationships.  . “The key point here is they found that the socialization part was important primarily when it was associated with some kind of useful function,” said Dr. William J. Hall, a geriatrician who was not involved in the study.  . “The party line on this from geriatricians like me is that some form of social engagement seems to be absolutely essential for maximizing the chances you will have good brain function for those years,” said Hall, who directs the Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. . Study authors Katherine Burn and Cassandra Szoeke, researchers at the University of Melbourne in Parkville, Australia, point out in the journal Maturitas that lifestyle and environmental factors are easy, inexpensive ways of boosting cognitive health and might even help stave off chronic illnesses like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.    . For the new study, they used data from the Women’s Healthy Ageing Project, which Szoeke directs, and which involves Australian women originally recruited for a midlife study in 1991, when they were aged 45 to 55.  . The 224 women included in the new analysis were between 65 and 75 and lived in the Melbourne area. Most had grandkids, and most spent time taking care of an average of three grandchildren. Those who did care for grandchildren were about a year younger and more likely to have at least 12 years of formal education than those who didn’t.   . The researchers used various tests to gauge the women’s cognitive ability, asking them to read numbers forward and backward, name as many animals, boy’s names and fruit and furniture as they could and to copy a drawing. . To test memory, the women repeated a word list and named as many words as they could beginning with different letters. . After factoring in the women’s age and education levels, the researchers found that those who were caring for grandkids one day per week did better on the cognitive tests than those who weren’t minding grandkids, or those who were caring for grandkids up to five days a week.   . “We wanted to be able to guide people on a common, in fact the most popular informal childcare option prevalent in our community,” Szoeke said in an email. “The aspects of social engagement hypothesized to be responsible for the benefits on cognition (positive mood, mental stimulation, increased activity) were highly relevant to activity as a grandparent.” . But more research is needed on the benefits of social engagement to cognition in general, and especially on the role grandparenting could play in its maintenance, the authors note.   . The study did not account for health or economic factors that might affect the women’s cognitive function, as well as possibly influencing whether or how often they cared for their grandchildren.  . The authors acknowledge that their results suggest a connection between some amount of grandparenting and better mental function, but cannot prove cause and effect. . Hall said that he wasn’t sure if the results would apply to the United States, where the pace is faster and the quality of life less “tranquil” than in Melbourne. But he said he thought the information should prove useful to older people. . “In the field of geriatrics and gerontology, this whole idea of social engagement and what kind of social engagement goes forward is extremely hot right now,” said Hall. “This is better than treating people with pills. .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters) - Children exposed to tobacco smoke at home are up to three times more likely to have attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) as unexposed kids, according to a new study from Spain.  . The association was stronger for kids with one or more hours of secondhand smoke exposure every day, the authors found. And the results held when researchers accounted for parents’ mental health and other factors. . “We showed a significant and substantial dose–response association between (secondhand smoke) exposure in the home and a higher frequency of global mental problems,” the authors write in Tobacco Control. . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two of every five children in the US are exposed to secondhand smoke regularly.  . Alicia Padron of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida and colleagues in Spain analyzed data from the 2011 to 2012 Spanish National Health Interview Survey, in which parents of 2,357 children ages four to 12 reported the amount of time their children were exposed to secondhand smoke every day. . The parents also filled out questionnaires designed to evaluate their children’s mental health. According to the results, about eight percent of the kids had a probable mental disorder.  . About seven percent of the kids were exposed to secondhand smoke for less than one hour per day, and 4.5 percent were exposed for an hour or more each day.  . After taking the parent’s mental health, family structure and socioeconomic status into consideration, children who were exposed to secondhand smoke for less than one hour per day were 50 percent more likely to have some mental disorder compared to kids not exposed at all.  . And children who were habitually exposed to secondhand smoke for an hour or more each day were close to three times more likely to have a mental disorder.  . In addition, kids exposed less than one hour per day were twice as likely to have ADHD as kids who weren’t exposed, and children exposed for an hour or more on a daily basis were over three times more likely to have ADHD. . “The association between secondhand smoke and global mental problems was mostly due to the impact of secondhand smoke on the attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder,” the authors write.  . The study looks at a single point in time and cannot prove that secondhand smoke exposure causes mental health problems, the study team cautions.  . Frank Bandiera, a researcher with the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston who was not involved in the study, liked that the researchers “controlled for parents’ mental health in the new study because that could be a confounder.” . But, he added, the study might be limited because, although the questionnaires are thought to be valid, the mental disorders were not actually diagnosed by physicians. . “We’re not sure if it’s causal or not,” Bandiera told Reuters Health. “I think (the research) is still in the early stages and the findings are inconclusive.” . But, he said, since secondhand hand smoke has been related to a lot of physical diseases, parents should avoid smoking around their kids. . “We need to sort it out more, so we’re not sure yet, but just as a precaution, I don’t think parents should smoke at home  - they should keep their kids away from secondhand smoke,” Bandiera said. . Lucy Popova, from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said there is a lot of evidence about the harms of secondhand smoke on physical wellbeing. . “But research on effects of secondhand smoke on mental health have been really just emerging and this study really contributes to this growing body of evidence that exposure to secondhand smoke in children might be responsible for cognitive and behavioral problems,” she said.  . Popova, who wasn’t involved in the study, said no amount of secondhand smoke is safe – any exposure is bad. . “So parents should not expose their children – the best thing to do is quit,” she said. “And this will not only not expose their children to the secondhand smoke, but will also let them enjoy their life with their children longer.” .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Swimmers, especially endurance swimmers, are more likely than other water sport competitors to have asthma, according to a new study of Olympic athletes. . Researchers found that about a quarter of competitors in swimming events had verified asthma, although it was more common among athletes from some parts of the world than others.  . The intensity of swimmer training, or long hours spent in the water, may expose swimmers to more chlorine byproducts compared to divers or other athletes who spend less time breathing just at the water’s surface, experts said. . A long-term study would help distinguish “between athletes with asthma who self-select to swimming and those who have asthma as a result of exposure to endurance training practices,” said lead author Dr. Margo Mountjoy of McMaster University Waterloo campus in Ontario, Canada. . Mountjoy is a practicing sports physician in aquatics and a member of a Therapeutic Use Exemption Committee for the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Association. . She and her coauthors studied objective evidence of asthma among all aquatic athletes who competed at the 2005, 2007 and 2009 FINA World Championships and the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games in swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo and open water swimming events.  . Athletes with asthma were required to show proof of airway obstruction with a clinical test in order to use their inhaled medications, which are otherwise prohibited during competition. . Most years, swimming events had more participants with asthma or other airway obstruction than other aquatic events. At the 2008 Olympic Games, an exception, the synchronized swimmers and open water swimmers also had high asthma rates. . Each year, between 12 and 25 percent of swimmers had asthma. In 2008, almost 25 percent of swimmers, 26 percent of open water swimmers and 22 percent of synchronized swimmers had asthma. . In general, more athletes in endurance events like triathlon, pentathlon or cycling had asthma than those in nonendurance sports like fencing, volleyball or table tennis, the authors note.  . Asthma was more common in aquatic endurance sports, which included swimming, open water swimming and synchronized swimming, than in nonedurance events like diving, they write in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. . “I was not surprised to find that swimmers had a high prevalence of asthma,” Mountjoy told Reuters Health by email. “What was surprising for me to find was that there were significant differences between the endurance and non-endurance sports, as well as the distinct geographical distributions.” . More athletes from Oceania, Europe and North America had asthma than those from Asia, Africa and South America, the authors found. . “It was also interesting to find that although asthma is more prevalent in women than in men in the general population, this gender difference was not evident in the elite aquatic population,” Mountjoy said. . Some postulate that the chlorine-derived chemicals in the air of aquatic training facilities may cause asthma, she said. . “It is exposure to the chlorine and chlorinated compounds that is responsible for the changes in airway hyper responsiveness,” said Dr. Don McKenzie, who studies respiratory exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. . The more swimming you do, the more the risk increases, and elite athletes spend the most time with the chemicals, McKenzie, who was not involved in the new study, told Reuters Health by email. . “If you swim in non-chlorinated pools, lakes, ocean etc. then the risk disappears,” he said. . Alfred Bernard of the Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels, Belgium, agrees the chlorine-based oxidants building up at the surface of pools that the elite swimmers actively inhale penetrate deeply in the lungs and probably cause asthma. . Divers and water polo players may hyperventilate less than elite endurance swimmers, breathe more through the nose and do not continuously inhale the chlorine-laden air just above the water’s surface, which may explain the decreased prevalence of asthma, Bernard told Reuters Health by email. . Historically, asthmatic children may have been encouraged to practice swimming and may go on to other aquatic disciplines, Mountjoy said. . “Swimmers should be aware that if they have a chronic cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing, they should seek medical attention for appropriate testing and treatment,” she said. “They should also ensure that their training environment has appropriate ventilation with respect to air quality.” . Asthmatic swimmers were no more or less likely to earn medals than other athletes, Mountjoy noted, which means it may not affect performance if properly treated. . “The health benefits of swimming are numerous and the risk of developing asthma at the elite level does not negate these other important health benefits,” she concluded. .

Mathew Stock|LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND / KADUNA, NIGERIA - A new anti-venom to treat victims of potentially deadly snake bites in sub-Saharan Africa is just a few years away from reality, according to scientists at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). They aim to create a potent new anti-venom that can be stored safely at room temperature, without the need for refrigeration. . Dr. Robert Harrison is leading the research at LSTM’s Alistair Reid Venom Research Unit, where he has collected 21 species - 450 animals in total - of sub-Saharan Africa’s most deadly snakes. Harrison and his team have been extracting venom from the reptiles, using a process known as ‘milking’, to concoct a new anti-venom that he hopes will prevent the deaths and severe injuries of snake bite victims. . “32,000 people are dying from snake bite every year in sub-Saharan Africa. But it’s not only that; other people who survive the bite - about 100,000 of them - are living with severe disabled limbs or legs, just really very disabling conditions,” said Harrison. . He added that the impact on communities can be particularly severe if a snake bite renders a family’s main bread-winner unable to work: “People are exposed to snakebite by whatever they’re doing and wherever they’re doing it. And what it does do is affect these people dramatically, because the loss of the main income earner for instance because his arm can no longer function or he’s had his leg amputated as a result of snakebite. Or, god forbid, he dies from snakebite then you can see how massively that would affect this tiny little family unit that is living on probably less than a dollar a day.” . Anti-venoms are made by first ‘milking’ the venom from a snake before injecting it in low doses into a horse or sheep. The animal doesn’t become ill, but the venom induces an immune response that produces anti-bodies in the animal. These anti-bodies are then extracted from the animal’s blood to create anti-venom. . In rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa where people are exposed to various species of deadly snakes, the current treatment involves a broad-spectrum anti-venom to cover all the snake species that could be responsible. But the current method for producing anti-venoms means the animals make only a small amount of anti-body to any one species; resulting in a weak anti-venom. Patients are therefore having to be treated with multiple vials; carrying an increased risk of side-effects and making the treatment largely unaffordable to rural subsistence farmers. According to the UK’s Medical Research Council, a single vial of the most effective broad-spectrum anti-venom currently costs about $140 USD per vial, and because several vials are needed to achieve a cure it can cost over $500 USD per treatment; an insurmountable cost for people who often earn less that $1 USD a day. . However, the research team at LSTM plans to vastly improve the potency of broad-spectrum anti-venom using an innovative new technique they’ve dubbed ‘antivenomics’, which targets unique proteins in a particular snake species’ venom. This, they say, will significantly expand the effectiveness of the anti-venom to cover all the poisonous snakes of sub-Saharan Africa. . “So what we’re going to try and do is take our existing anti-venom which we made for Nigeria and has been used in Nigeria; which is effective, and it’s cheap and it’s safe. Now we’re going to make it more effective against all the other snakes of sub-Saharan Africa. And we’re going to do that by identifying the proteins that are unique to all the other species. And taking these unique proteins. i.e. different from the Source Scale Viper, the Puff Adder or the Spitting Cobra, and add that to the venoms of the original three,” explained Harrison. . The anti-venom will be manufactured using a more cost-effective system developed in Costa Rica, reducing costs by up to three quarters and making it more affordable to rural African communities. . The current need for anti-venoms to be refrigerated throughout their manufacture and storage is a further limitation that they hope to overcome. Harrison’s team plans to test a series of special molecules added to the anti-venom during creation to increase its stability at ambient temperatures, with the aim of it still being effective after at least a year stored at room temperature. . “And at the end of three-and-a-half, four years now; so 2018, July 2018 - we will do the ultimate test of whether this new anti-venom, when it’s stored at room temperature for at least a year, is effective against all the snakes of sub-Saharan Africa.”|Thu Apr 02 20:53:31 +0000 2015||Deadly snakes 'milked' to create potent new anti-venom |5.837340252081316e+17|http://reut.rs/1BSFbWH
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - - Walking for 15 minutes may help overweight people at least temporarily reduce cravings for high-calorie, sugary snacks, a small study suggests. . “This study showed that brisk walking can be used as a strategy to reduce momentary food craving,” said Adrian Meule, a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany who wasn’t involved in the research. . Exercise may provide some cognitive stimulation that interferes with thoughts about the craved food, and the discipline to regularly take walks to circumvent cravings might also improve the ability to follow through with healthy food choices, Meule said in an email.  . Globally, almost 2 billion adults are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. This increases their risk of premature death, breathing difficulties, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, fractures and mental health issues.  . The study, by Larissa Ledochowski at the University of Innsbruck in Austria and colleagues, examined the impact of a 15-minute treadmill walk on sugar cravings in a group of 47 overweight people who were on average about 28 years old.  . To elevate sugary snack cravings, participants were asked to abstain from eating any sweets for three days at the start of the study. They were also asked to fast, drink nothing but water, and avoid any exercise for two hours prior to each assessment of cravings.  . Then, in an exercise session, some participants warmed up for two minutes slowly on a treadmill then walked for 15 minutes at a pace fast enough to catch a bus, but not to the point of breathlessness.  . For comparison, other participants, instead of exercise, were told to sit passively for 15 minutes without doing anything.  . After exercising or sitting still, all of the participants sat quietly for five minutes. Then, they did a computerized test designed to boost physiological arousal and stress. Next, they were asked to unwrap a piece of candy and hold it without eating it. . Throughout the process, participants were questioned seven different times about their food cravings and their feelings of arousal or stress. . Those who exercised reported significantly lower cravings for sweets mid-way through the experiment and at the end than the participants who didn’t get on the treadmill.  . Even when people unwrapped candy and held it in their hands, people who exercised first had fewer cravings than those who didn’t. . The study is small, and its limitations include relying on people to tell the truth about abstaining from sweets before the start of the experiment and a lack of measurements to track how much exertion was required by each participant to walk on the treadmill. . They were also exercising at a fairly low intensity, said Margaret Schneider, a researcher at the University of California, Irvine.  . “The study only looks at the short-term impact, so we really shouldn’t draw any conclusions about how one 15-minute exercise bout would impact eating behavior throughout the day,” Schneider, who wasn’t involved in the study, said in an email. . Even so, exercise does have the ability to improve mood, and it’s possible that this could result in reduced cravings among individuals who eat for emotional reasons, she said. At the same time, mild exercise can also trigger metabolic processes that make more blood sugar available to the brain, reducing the craving for sugary foods. . And the study offers a reason to consider working at a treadmill desk, also known as walking work stations, Schneider said. “Presumably, remaining active at a low intensity throughout the day will result in less snacking and enhanced mood among the overweight.” . Keeping healthy snacks on hand will also help exercise have the intended effect on food choices, Meule said. “Otherwise, temporarily reducing food craving by brisk walking will be ineffective. Even if people successfully manage to control their food cravings, they still have to eat something.” . SOURCE: .

Karen Freifeld|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of 14 state attorneys general on Thursday asked the U.S. Congress to investigate the herbal supplements industry after a New York probe of the products turned up ingredients that were not listed on labels and raised safety concerns. . The group, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Illinois Attorney General Greg Zoeller, also asked Congress to consider giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration more oversight of herbal supplements. . “We believe the safety and efficacy of these supplements is a matter of deep public concern across the country,” the attorneys general said in the letter, urging “swift action.” . In February, four major retailers, GNC Holdings Inc, Target Corp, Walgreens and Wal Mart Stores Inc, halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by the New York attorney general. DNA tests had failed to detect plant materials listed on the majority of products tested. . On Monday, GNC reached an agreement with Schneiderman to adopt more stringent testing standards than the FDA requires, and began to resell the supplements. . A study found the products were within FDA guidelines, Schneiderman said. GNC said tests also showed its products were safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance. . The attorneys general sent their letter requesting a probe to Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Pennsylvania Representative Joe Pitts, chairmen of subcommittees on product safety and health. They cited the New York probe and said researchers also have found other problems, including high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic in certain supplements.  . The letter was signed by attorneys general from Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Northern Mariana Islands, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. . The attorneys general asked the subcommittees to work with the FDA to see whether the agency should develop enhanced quality assurance programs and other safety requirements. Currently, the FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of rules than those covering drug products. . Steve Mister, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry group, said the New York attorney general’s investigation was discredited and concerns about “alleged widespread safety issues are not true.” . He said “the industry is already amply regulated on a federal level.” |Thu Apr 02 20:37:44 +0000 2015||States ask U.S. Congress to launch inquiry of herbal supplements |5.837300547163382e+17|http://reut.rs/1y4g9sP
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a decision that could reshape U.S. tobacco regulation, a health advisory panel will vote next week on whether Swedish Match AB, a Stockholm-based maker of smokeless tobacco products known as snus, can claim they are less harmful than cigarettes. . The closely watched vote could pave the way for the first Food and Drug Administration approval of a modified risk tobacco product and set a precedent for companies seeking to make similar claims. The two-day discussion will culminate in a vote on April 10th. . Snus is a moist smokeless tobacco product that users place underneath the upper lip. It can be bought loose, or in small teabag-like pouches. It does not involve chewing or spitting.  . Swedish Match is asking permission to remove required warnings about mouth cancer, gum disease and tooth loss from its product packaging, saying there is no evidence to support a link between mouth disease and Swedish snus. It proposes retaining the risk of nicotine addiction. . The company also wants to replace a warning that smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes with one that acknowledges no tobacco product is safe, but states its own products are substantially less risky than cigarettes. . The hurdles for winning approval are high. . In crafting the 2009 law giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco, Congress, leery of the industry’s misleading marketing of implicitly safer “light” and “low tar” cigarettes, set rigorous standards for approving modified risk products. . Companies must show a product significantly reduces the risk of disease for individual tobacco users. It must also show a health benefit to the population as a whole, taking into account tobacco and non-tobacco users. . Products such as snus and e-cigarettes are generally considered safer than combustible cigarettes and may benefit a smoker who switches. But if smokers use both products instead of switching, or if the less risky products are taken up by people who otherwise would not have used any tobacco product, the calculus might be different. . Swedish Match believes it has a strong case. . Snus use in Sweden, particularly among men, has risen over the past 30 years. It is now the country’s most popular tobacco product. At the same time, smoking rates have plunged to the lowest in Europe. Smoking related diseases, including lung cancer and heart disease, have also fallen. . Azim Chowdhury, a partner at the law firm Keller and Heckman LLP, said regulators should not ignore such statistics. If FDA were to deny Swedish Match’s application, Chowdhury said, “they would basically be saying no-one will ever be approved.” . Scott Ballin, a health policy consultant based in Washington, D.C., agrees. He sees a 60 percent chance the advisory panel will vote in favor of Swedish Match but concedes opposition from public health groups is strong. . “If the committee responds to pressure from tobacco control advocates who believe that all tobacco is equally harmful then I think we will see it punting and suggesting more research needs to be done,” he said. . Opponents of approval argue FDA does not have legal authority to permit changes to government-mandated warning labels. Moreover, they say, the proposed label changes do not appropriately capture potential risks associated with snus. . “We don’t know yet whether or not we are going to see people use both products, or whether kids take up snus who would not otherwise have smoked,” said Erika Sward, an advocate with the American Lung Association. . Critics also say it is unclear whether the population-level benefits seen in Sweden would translate to the United States. Other factors, including more restrictive bans on advertising, could be at play. . “The real question isn’t whether a well done application for Swedish snus could qualify for a modified risk claim, it is whether this specific request should qualify,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. . Sandy Fowler-Jones, a Swedish Match spokeswoman, said the FDA “fully vetted” the legal issue before the company filed its application. The agency can permit changes to an individual product’s warning label, she said. . Adult smokeless tobacco use was 3.6 percent in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with the highest rates among 18 to 25-year-old males. . The overall rate of snus use was 2.5 percent during the same period. Among high school boys it was 3.9 percent. . U.S. smokeless tobacco products include Altria Group’s Copenhagen, Skoal and Red Seal brands. . Altria also sells Marlboro snus and Reynolds American Inc sells Camel snus. These products would not be covered by any FDA decision on the Swedish Match product, but some anti-tobacco groups fear that consumers would not differentiate. . Swedish Match’s products follow standards for reducing heavy metals and other toxic substances that U.S. products are not bound by. In an odd twist, Swedish snus is banned in Europe outside Sweden for health reasons. . Cigarettes remain on the market. |Thu Apr 02 17:46:39 +0000 2015||Swedish Match gears up for closely watched FDA panel meeting |5.836869985793597e+17|http://reut.rs/1y3Etei
Gene Emery|(Reuters Health) - People undergoing surgery for rectal cancer fare just as well whether they have conventional or minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, suggests a new international comparison involving 1,044 patients. . However, when the tumor is in the lower rectum, laparoscopic surgery seems better, according to the results in the New England Journal of Medicine. . Overall survival rates were 86.7 percent when the surgery was done with just a few puncture holes in the body versus 83.6 percent when the abdomen was opened up. Just 5 percent of people in both groups had a cancer recurrence within three years.  . “This is the largest trial to date and we can now state with evidence that laparoscopic surgery is safe and associated with long-term cancer outcomes that are at least similar to open surgery,” Dr. Jaap Bonjer, the lead author, told Reuters Health. . “With laparoscopic surgery, the short-term outcomes are better. What that means is patients experience less pain after surgery, bowel function returns earlier and the post-operative recovery goes more quickly,” said Bonjer of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam. . But Dr. Heather Yeo, an assistant professor of surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, urged caution because the test involved highly-skilled surgeons operating on specially-selected patients whose tumors had not spread.  . And the new findings do not discuss which group was more likely to retain proper bowel and bladder control, or sexual function, an important element for patients, noted Yeo, who was not involved in the study. . About 466,000 people develop rectal cancer worldwide each year. Doctors have begun to favor such “keyhole” surgery because it is so much less invasive. . But there has been lingering concern over whether the gas that was injected in the abdomen to create a working space for laparascopic surgery tools would displace too many cancer cells and transfer those tumor cells to the incisions in the abdominal wall, Bonjer said. . The new study, known as COLOR II, was designed to address that question. . Thirty hospitals in Europe, North America and Asia enrolled patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum in the study. People whose tumors had spread to other tissues were excluded. Ethicon Endo-Surgery Europe, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, paid for the study. . Yeo said the surgeons in the study “had multiple evaluations of their skill and their experience before they were even enrolled in the trial,” so the results show what can happen under ideal conditions. . Although both types of surgery generally gave comparable results, the researchers found that the location of the tumor made a difference. . When the cancer was in the lower rectum, the three-year recurrence rate was 3.8 percent with laparoscopic surgery versus 12.7 percent with traditional surgery. . With conventional open surgery, it can be harder for a surgeon to see deep into the pelvis, Bonjer explained. A laparoscope can get a better view, and the image is magnified, he said, “so the surgeon can operate with greater precision.” . Over all, laparoscopic surgery also produced a higher rate of disease-free survival - 64.9 percent versus 52.0 percent - in people with stage 3 disease, where the tumor has spread to adjacent lymph nodes. . The type of surgery did not affect the risk of death, regardless of the stage of the cancer. The risk of distant metastases was also similar in the two groups. . “We only included patients whose cancers had not invaded adjacent organs such as the bladder and ureters,” Bonjer said. “With patients who have larger cancers, it needs to be done open because it’s too complex to do laparoscopically.”  . Yeo said, “For patients, I think the important thing is to make sure their surgeon is a high-volume surgeon” with lots of experience in rectal cancer surgery. . “The big question is going to be the functional outcomes,” she said, referring to how well patients retain their bowel, bladder and sexual functioning. . “Forty percent to 60 percent have bowel problems; 20 percent to 30 percent have problems with urinary function and probably 30 percent to 40 percent have sexual function problems after rectal cancer surgery,” she said. “So those are the kinds of reasons you should go to a specialist.” .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Even though doctors have long been taught to deliver biopsy results in person, many patients may prefer the speed and convenience of a phone call, a recent study of U.S. dermatology clinics finds. . “We thought they would want it to be in person or by email, but it turned out that the phone was most preferred; it’s quick and it also gives them the chance to ask questions,” said co-author Dr. Maria Wei, director of the melanoma surveillance clinic at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).  . Wei and colleagues surveyed 298 patients examined at melanoma clinics at UCSF, the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University to see how they wanted to be informed of their test results.  . On average, participants were about 54 years old. About half were men and the group was predominantly white. Almost nine in 10 had a previous history of melanoma and about one-third had a family history of this type of skin cancer.  . The group was well-educated; about 34 percent went to graduate school and roughly 48 percent went to college.  . Most patients in the study had either what’s known as stage 0 melanoma, when the cancer hasn’t grown deeper than the top layer of skin, known as the epidermis, or stage 1, when the tumor is very thin and less likely to spread.  . Before they knew if they would need biopsies, patients were asked how they would want to receive biopsy results. About two-thirds wanted to speak directly to their physician by phone, and another 20 percent preferred to return to the clinic to get results in person.  . Not many people wanted to get a voicemail though, an option preferred by just 5 percent of participants, the same proportion who said they’d like to get results by accessing an online patient portal system.  . Less than 3 percent preferred email, and even fewer patients expressed interest in receiving text messages.  . More than half of the study participants said they would make the same choice whether the biopsy was positive or negative for cancer.  . Doctors also said phone calls work best, though they were less likely to make the call themselves for a negative result. . The researchers surveyed 84 physicians to get their take on the ideal way to share test results. This group was younger, 43 years old on average, and had typically been practicing medicine for about 11 years. . To deliver bad news, about 57 percent of doctors would pick up the phone, compared with just 31 percent for good news. Their second choice in either situation was to delegate the call to an assistant. Like their patients, few favored email.  . To some extent, people may have chosen the most familiar option. . Patients at Duke, where an online patient portal has been up and running for longer, were most likely to choose this option, though it was still their second choice after a phone call. Face-to-face communication, the second choice at UCSF and UPenn, was preferred by only 5.6 percent of patients at Duke. . Limitations of the study include its small sample size and its focus on academic medical centers, where patient populations can be different from those at local clinics in the community, the researchers note in JAMA Dermatology. Ethnic minorities and people with limited English skills were not well-represented either, they acknowledge.  . And there’s no way to know if patients getting biopsies for other forms of cancer would have the same set of preferences. . Still, online portals and electronic communication are likely to gain in popularity as they become more commonplace and simpler for patients and physicians to navigate, said Dr. Jennifer Stein, a dermatologist at New York University School of Medicine who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. . “As generations change and as technology changes, we may be moving more in that direction,” Stein said. “As we move toward more patient-centered care, this shows that just asking a patient how they want to receive information can be really illuminating.” .

South Dakota has found its first infection of the H5N2 flu strain, which can kill a poultry flock within 48 hours, in turkeys, according to the agency. . Recent infections of avian flu in states stretching from Arkansas to Oregon have prompted overseas buyers to limit imports of U.S. poultry from companies such as Tyson Foods Inc, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc. .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - The more procedures surgeons have performed, the better their patients’ outcomes, at least until the doctors hit a learning plateau, according to a new analysis of data on more than one million surgeries. . The flattening out of the learning curve happens at different points - ranging from 25 to 750 procedures - for different types of surgery, the authors found.  . “For the past two decades or so, many researchers have acknowledged that a surgeon’s experience is related to his or her performance,” said coauthor Barnabas J. Gilbert of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  . But studies in the area have been inconsistent, so there have not been many practice guidelines based on the learning curve data, Gilbert said. . “Our results are exciting and, we hope, will be used to shape the surgical training programs of the future,” he told Reuters Health by email. . The authors analyzed the results of 57 recent studies of surgical performance, conducted in 14 countries with a total of more than 17,000 surgeons and 35 different procedure types.  . Most studies measured the volume of cases a surgeon handled, and some also included years of practice. In 44 studies, researchers found that the amount of time procedures took, rates of recurrence of the condition, complication rates, requirements for blood transfusions, mortality and stroke rates all improved as the surgeon’s number of past cases increased. . “Of all the studies included in our review, only two showed the surgical learning curve ‘leveling out’, where increased experience failed to improve operative outcomes,” Gilbert said. “The time at which this plateau occurred was procedure-specific, taking approximately 12 years of experience in the case of bilateral reduction mammoplasty and somewhere between 5 and 20 years for thyroidectomies, for example.” . A minority of studies found an insignificant learning curve, and one focusing on off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery found that factors like patient heart failure, renal failure, type of bypass and sex were more important predictors of outcome than surgeon experience, according to the results published in the Annals of Surgery. . Performance may deteriorate toward the end of a surgeon’s career as well, Gilbert said. After 20 years of practice, surgeons removing the thyroid were more likely than others to cause recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and hypoparathyroidism, which are serious complications, he said. . “In the U.S., groups such as Healthgrades, RateMDs and Vitals run doctor-rating websites, which provide overall ratings of individual surgeons based on a combination of factors, including the number of patients treated in the last 12 months,” Gilbert said. . But the ratings are based on online patient satisfaction reviews and attaining specific information on individual surgeon case volume is still difficult for patients, he said. . In the UK, case volumes and outcomes of individual surgeons are published annually, which makes surgical care more transparent, he noted. . “Patients have a right to know how good a surgeon or surgical team is, before deciding to undergo surgery,” said Dr. Fiona Godlee, editor in chief of the BMJ. “They should have access to data on outcomes from individual teams.” . “Based on this new review of the evidence, these outcomes will be better for more experienced surgeons, although performance plateaus off after a while, which shows the need to keep the data up to date in order to keep surgeons on their toes,” said Godlee, who was not part of the new research. . In general, surgeons with the most experience are likely to be found in large, specialist centers, in centralized hospitals, Gilbert said. . “In addition to a surgeon’s experience at performing a specific procedure, patients may wish to find out more overt risk-related metrics such as estimated complication rates,” he said. “Patients may also wish to look at a range of quality measures at the hospital where surgery is being performed, such as whether there is a specialized unit or designated operating room for a particular type of procedure, as well as how many operations of that kind have been performed at the hospital.” . Patients should also consider a surgeon’s communication skills and ability to build a trustworthy relationship, he said. . SOURCE: .

|ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said a 5-euro fee to access state hospitals had been scrapped and 4,500 healthcare workers would be hired, the latest move by his leftist government to ease what it calls a humanitarian crisis in the country. . The move is likely to further endear Tsipras to austerity-weary Greeks but represents yet another potential outlay by the cash-strapped government at a time when its European and IMF lenders are demanding a commitment to fiscal rigor.  . Still, the abolition of the 5 euro fee for hospital visits would hurt the budget by less than 20 million euros annually and the health workers are expected to be hired without running afoul of Greece’s pledge to trim the public sector. . “We want to turn the health sector from a victim of the bailouts, a victim of austerity, into a fundamental right for every resident of this country and we commit to do so at any cost,” Tsipras said, adding he would fight “barbaric conditions” in public hospitals and corruption in the sector.  . His government would unify data systems as part of measures to boost transparency and save money, he said, in a nod to a longtime demand from international lenders.  . In a package of reforms sent to lenders on Wednesday, Greece said it planned comprehensive healthcare reform with the universal right to quality healthcare. It cited a fiscal impact of 2.1-2.7 billion euros without specifying if that represented outlays or potential revenues from tackling corruption.   . Greece spends 11 billion euros a year on its public healthcare system - accounting for about 5 percent of its total economic output, which Tsipras said represented the lowest level of health spending among EU countries.  . Years of deep cuts in health spending have hurt standards of care in Greece’s state hospitals where there is often a shortage of basic supplies while fewer doctors and nurses look after more patients, an increasing number of whom are uninsured. . About 2.5 million Greeks have no health insurance, Tsipras said. Health officials caution that despite the worsening conditions in the sector, most Greeks are able to access the health system without insurance. . “All citizens, after this terrifying crisis, should have access to healthcare irrespective of whether they have insurance or not,” Tsipras said.  . “We will not tolerate the exploitation of human pain.” |Thu Apr 02 12:56:14 +0000 2015||Greece scraps hospital visit fee, to hire health workers |5.836139133019095e+17|http://reut.rs/1CB8PTL
Zeba Siddiqui|MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is likely to add more HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis drugs to its list of essential medicines that are subject to price caps, people directly involved in the process said, in a move to improve affordability of drugs to treat the deadly diseases. . All the drugs on the government’s HIV/AIDS and TB control programs are likely to be added in the list, the people said. . India provides a number of key HIV/AIDS and TB medicines for free under the government’s disease control programs through state-run clinics and distribution centers.  . But many patients, particularly those with TB, prefer more expensive private clinics as treatment is widely considered of higher quality. The private sector accounts for about 80 percent of India’s healthcare delivery market. . India has about 2.2 million TB patients, the highest in the world, and an estimated 2.1 million are afflicted with HIV/AIDS. . The additional HIV/AIDS and TB medicines would join a list of nearly 400 essential drugs under price control in India, where more than 70 percent of people live on under $2 a day and health insurance is scarce. . The revised list of essential medicines could be announced in the next six months, said four members of a health ministry panel that was set up to review the list that was last revised in 2011. . The people, who declined to name the medicines that could be added, did not want to be identified as the additions have not been finalised. . Y.K. Gupta, vice chairman of the panel, declined to comment on new drugs that would be part of the list and said the discussions were ongoing. . “We are reviewing drugs across therapy areas, and there could be additions as well as deletions to the 2011 list,” said Gupta. “We will have better clarity on when the list could be out by the end of April.” . Indian drugmakers Cipla Ltd, privately held Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Hetero Healthcare Ltd are among the major companies selling HIV/AIDS drugs in India.  . TB drugs are sold by domestic firms such as Lupin Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, as well as foreign firms such as Sanofi SA, Pfizer Inc and Novartis AG. . Some firms could stop making the drugs if they feel the drug prices are capped too low, said S. Srinivasan, a health activist with All India Drug Action Network, a group of non-profit organizations working to improve access to essential medicines.  . “The aim is to improve affordability, but the effect of price control is unpredictable,” Srinivasan said.  |Thu Apr 02 10:47:49 +0000 2015||India to add more AIDS, TB drugs to essential medicines list: sources |5.835815939163505e+17|http://reut.rs/1CAGb5p
|(Reuters) - A patient who was being evaluated for possible Ebola at a Colorado hospital has tested negative for the virus, the state’s health department said on Thursday.  .

At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States - four of them diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil - amid an epidemic centered in West Africa during the last year. . Only two people are known to have contracted the virus in the United States - both of them nurses who treated an Ebola patient from Liberia who became sick while visiting Dallas. That man, Thomas Duncan, died in October. .

Umaru Fofana|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone’s President Ernest Bai Koroma said on Wednesday authorities would soon start laying off staff recruited to fight Ebola as the numbers of cases decline, but these workers would be employed elsewhere, where possible. . Sierra Leone and neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone are battling to stamp out the worst Ebola outbreak on record, which has killed over 10,000 people during the last year. . Addressing the country about the outbreak, Koroma said the infection rate was falling “week by week” and the number of treatment facilities and staff would be reduced, despite the need for continued vigilance. . “For those who will be laid off because of the scaling down of facilities, let me express my sincere thanks to you for your brave national service to your country,” he said. No details were given on how many people would be laid off. . At the peak of the crisis last year, authorities were struggling to recruit local and foreign medics to tackle Ebola, which has killed nearly 500 local health workers in West Africa, according to United Nations statistics. . Sierra Leone began paying staff $100 per week hazard pay but Koroma said that has been ended. . “Because you have all done a good job, because you have also gained valuable knowledge and skills that are forever now required in this country, the government is working toward providing employment and absorbing some of you into the service as soon as possible,” he said. . Schools that were closed in July last year are due to re-open on April 14th and tuition fees will be waived in public schools for the next two years, he said. . The leaders of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have set April 16 as a target for no new cases. . Despite an overall trend showing the disease is coming under control, U.N. figures released on Wednesday showed a total of 82 new cases in the region during the week to March 29.    . Guinea, which appears to be the worst affected at this time, saw an increase in the number of areas recording Ebola, with seven prefectures reporting at last one confirmed case.  . Guinea has declared a 45-day state of health emergency in the prefectures of Forecariah, Coyah, Dubreka, Boffa, and Kindia. |Thu Apr 02 00:51:20 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone to start laying off Ebola workers as cases fall: president |5.834314849057546e+17|http://reut.rs/1CyU1oW
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Roche blood test to screen fetuses for Down syndrome worked far better than standard prenatal screening tests in younger, low-risk women, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday, setting the stage for more widespread use.  . The new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the largest to show the tests are accurate in even low-risk women. But experts warned that women who test positive still need to confirm the result through more invasive diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis, especially if they would consider terminating a pregnancy.  . “This is a great test for detecting Down syndrome but it doesn’t detect everything, it isn’t diagnostic, and it doesn’t always work to provide a result,” said Dr. Mary Norton of the University of California, San Francisco. . Prior studies have shown such fetal DNA tests, which measure DNA fragments from the placenta circulating in the mother’s blood, are highly accurate at detecting Down syndrome and two other chromosomal abnormalities in high-risk women, typically those over the age of 35.  . Several physicians’ organizations have supported use of the newer cell free fetal DNA tests over the standard screening in older, high-risk women. . Norton and colleagues tested nearly 16,000 women who had an average age of 30. The researchers compared Roche’s Harmony  test to standard prenatal screening for Down syndrome - which relies on biomarkers in the blood and a fetal ultrasound - in the same group of women.  . The Roche test identified all 38 cases of Down syndrome compared with 30 detected by standard screening. The false positive rate for the new fetal DNA test was 0.06 percent of the study population versus 5.4 percent for standard screening.  . But there were still nine false positive results in the group that got cell free fetal DNA screening.  . In addition, in nearly 500 women the fetal DNA test was not able to deliver any result because there was not enough fetal DNA in the pregnant women’s blood. Further testing, however, showed that some 2.7 percent of fetuses had chromosomal defects, including those that could not have been detected by the new fetal DNA technique. . More than 1 million fetal DNA tests have been performed since 2011. One of their advantages is that if women test negative, they can avoid having an invasive diagnostic test, which can cause miscarriages in roughly 1 in 600 women. . But the newer tests are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and companies are heavily promoting their performance in ways that may mislead patients, critics say. . In a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Ankita Patel and colleagues from Baylor College of Medicine and the Chinese University of Hong Kong warn that women should not decide to terminate pregnancies based on such screenings alone. . They cited their own work that collected data on 307 women who screened positive on fetal DNA tests. The results included 56 false positives, meaning the child did not have Down syndrome or the two other common abnormalities (trisomy 13 and 18) captured by the tests. . In some cases, women had already scheduled an abortion pending amniocentesis results, a test given between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. Even when that diagnostic proved the child did not have those abnormalities, some women questioned whether the screening result was more reliable. . “They think it is a diagnostic test because it’s genetic,” Patel said of the fetal DNA tests.  . Another reason for the confusion is the rapid introduction of this new technology. Many doctors are still just learning about it, said Dr. Michael Greene, chief of obstetrics, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research.  . He also points to companies’ aggressive marketing of their tests on the Internet. Ariosa Diagnostics, acquired by Roche in January, says its Harmony test for fetal chromosomal abnormalities offers “clear answers to questions that matter,” promising “accurate results from as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy.” . Rival Sequenom Inc says on its website that it offers unambiguous results: “There’s no room for maybe.” Other companies offering such tests include Illumina and privately-held Natera. . Greene said many women are not aware that these tests are not diagnostic and company disclaimers are not easy to find.  . Both Sequenom and Ariosa said they recommend healthcare providers counsel their patients that the screening test is not a replacement for a diagnostic test. . The FDA is weighing whether to regulate such tests. Patel believes the oversight might help because the tests “would have more disclaimers so women understand what they are getting into.” |Thu Apr 02 00:35:34 +0000 2015||Fetal DNA tests prove highly accurate but experts warn of exceptions |5.83427518339928e+17|http://reut.rs/1CyRnzq
Gene Emery|(Reuters Health) - - The puzzling case of a 56-year-old U.S. man who suddenly developed weakness, fatigue and body aches is leading doctors to warn that massive consumption of tea may be responsible for some unexplained cases of kidney failure. . It’s being called iced-tea nephropathy by the New England Journal of Medicine, which published a letter describing the case. . The source of the problem was an excessive amount of oxalate, a compound found in many foods. Excessive amounts can also come from “juicing,” having gastric bypass surgery, and by consuming foods with a lot of ascorbic acid such as beets, spinach, nuts and strawberries. . But in this case, the man reported that he was drinking 16 nine-ounce glasses of iced tea each day, giving him more than 1,500 milligrams of oxalate per day.  . The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics advises consuming no more than 40-50 mg of oxalate per day, the authors note. . “If you drink tea once or twice a day, it probably wouldn’t exceed what is the normal range for Americans. But this patient was taking 10 times that amount,” said Dr. Umbar Ghaffa of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, a coauthor of the letter. . Consuming too much oxalate can lead to kidney stones, which can damage the kidney by blocking the flow of urine. “But in this case there were oxalate crystals inside the kidney, and that generates an inflammatory reaction,” Ghaffar told Reuters Health. “If that’s not resolved it will cause scarring and loss of the kidney tissue. So that’s what probably was happening in this patient.” . He ultimately needed dialysis and remained on it because his kidney damage was so extensive. . “Usually if they’re at the stage where they need dialysis, it would be unusual for it to reverse,” said Dr. Gary Curhan, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved with the case. . The irony is that previous research has suggested that “people who take tea in the usual amounts actually have a lower risk of kidney stones,” Curhan said.  . “But in this case, the person was drinking huge amounts of oxalate,” he said. “I would caution people against drinking that much, but drinking a glass or two would not concern me.” . Ghaffar and her colleagues speculated that such regular excessive consumption of oxalate “may be an underrecognized cause of renal failure.”  . “The summer season is coming and a lot of people use a lot of iced tea in this season,” she said. “We just want to make patients aware that too much of anything is bad.” .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters) - Men who exercise more have better erectile and sexual function, suggests a small study of older overweight men. . The authors say their results support the idea that exercise might one day be prescribed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.  . While previous research has linked erections to physical activity, the current study is the first to include a high proportion of African-Americans and finds they get the same apparent benefit from exercise as white men. . “Our results confirm previous work, however, no study has ever addressed how a minimal amount of exercise impacts both erectile and sexual function among black men, a population with increased prevalence of erectile dysfunction risk factors including obesity, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle and lower socioeconomic status,” senior study author Adriana Vidal, a researcher at the Cedars-Sinai Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute in Los Angeles, said in an email.  . Vidal and colleagues examined exercise habits and sexual function in 295 healthy men who were part of a research project evaluating prostate cancer risk at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Carolina.  . On average, the men were about 62 years old, and they were all overweight or obese. Roughly one third had diabetes or a history of chest pain or heart attacks. About three quarters were current or former smokers. Ninety-three men, or about a third of the group, were African-American.  . Researchers asked the participants how often they exercised, and how intensely, as well as what types of physical activities they did. Men were scored based on a measure known as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours per week and placed in four categories ranging from sedentary, with three or fewer MET hours/week, to highly active, with at least 18 MET hours/week. . Most often, the men were sedentary, with 44 percent reporting little activity. But a substantial proportion, 26 percent, were highly active.  . Researchers also questioned the men about their sexual function, focusing on their ability to get erections and have orgasms, as well as the quality and frequency of their erections.  . Men rated their functionality on most questions from 1 to 5, with higher numbers equaling more satisfaction. Added up, responses could lead to a total score from 0 to 100.  . For all participants, the average sexual satisfaction score was 50.  . Men who reported more frequent exercise also reported higher sexual function scores. Half of the highly active men reported sexual function scores of at least 70, compared with a median score of about 33 for sedentary men. . The study is relatively small, and only looked at one point in time, so it wasn’t designed to prove that men can improve sexual function by getting more exercise, the researchers write in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. . The men in the study were also not that active, noted Dr. Joan Khoo, chief of endocrinology at Changi General Hospital in Singapore, in an email.  . To get the minimum amount of exercise needed to qualify as highly active in the study, men would need to do a moderately intense activity such as brisk walking, cycling or tennis for an hour three to four times a week, said Khoo, who wasn’t involved in the study. . Still, Khoo said, many factors besides exercise can contribute to sexual function. . “In addition to genetic differences, disparities between ethnic groups in psychological, cultural and socioeconomic barriers to diet and exercise may contribute to the observed association and benefit (or lack thereof) between ethnicity and erectile function,” Khoo said.  .

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Early-stage trials of an experimental Ebola vaccine, two in the United States and four in Africa and Europe, have found that it appears to be safe and triggered robust production of Ebola-fighting antibodies, scientists reported on Wednesday. . Since trials cannot ethically expose volunteers to Ebola, the production of antibodies is a proxy for whether vaccines could prevent or even treat the disease. . There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, which has killed over 10,000 people in West Africa since last spring, according to the World Health Organization. It is the worst Ebola epidemic in history, but finally appears to be abating. . The trials all tested a vaccine called VSV-ZEBOV, which was developed at the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corp and then to Merck & Co Inc. It consists of a cattle virus called rVSV that has been engineered to carry Ebola genes, which produce proteins meant to trigger production of anti-Ebola antibodies. . According to separate teams of scientists, that is what happened, two papers in the New England Journal of Medicine reported. . In the U.S. trials, conducted independently but cooperatively at the National Institutes of Health and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research starting last October, 52 healthy adult volunteers received single injections of saline or either of two doses of vaccine. . The most common side effects were mild, such as pain at the injection site and short-lived fever. All 40 participants who received vaccine produced anti-Ebola antibodies within 28 days, with most responding sooner. . The higher dose triggered triple the antibody response of the lower dose. The “robust” response to a single dose “could be particularly useful in outbreak interventions,” said Walter Reed’s Col. Stephen Thomas, senior author of the U.S. paper. . The higher dose is being tested in a larger trial in Liberia. Partly through that trial, both VSV-ZEBOV and an experimental vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline PLC called cAd3-EBOZ “appear to be safe,” NIH announced last week. [IDn:L2N0WS2WN] . The other studies were similarly encouraging. . In coordinated trials in Germany, Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya, 158 healthy volunteers received a placebo or any of five dose-levels of VSV-ZEBOV vaccine. . Although the Geneva study was temporarily halted last year after 11 of 51 participants developed arthritis, overall there were “no serious vaccine-related adverse events,” the researchers reported. All 150 people who received vaccine developed antibodies to Ebola with higher responses to higher doses. |Wed Apr 01 21:24:21 +0000 2015||Merck, NewLink Ebola vaccine appears safe, effective in new studies |5.833793975472947e+17|http://reut.rs/1xZeGE4
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - - Obese children may have taste buds that are less able to detect fats than those of leaner kids, a factor that could contribute to excessive eating, a small study suggests. . “Some people may be more susceptible to dietary fat than others,” said Russell Keast, a nutrition researcher at Deakin University in  Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The data indicates that there may be a genetic component to dietary fat that is highlighted in the obese,” he told Reuters Health in an email.  . Globally, about 60 million children, or 9 percent of all kids, will be overweight or obese by 2020, according to the World Health Organization. This makes them more likely to grow into obese adults and increases their risk of premature death, breathing difficulties, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, fractures and mental health issues.  . The study, by Naïm Khan at the Université de Bourgogne in France and colleagues, examined fat taste perception in 116 school children in Algeria who were 7 or 8 years old. The group included 57 obese children and 59 kids of average weight, with about the same number of boys and girls.  . The children were asked to come into the clinic on an empty stomach for a taste test of a series of drinks. They were given three clear liquids to taste, one of which contained an odorless and colorless fatty acid known as olenic acid. Then they were asked to identify which liquid was different from the others. . Obese children had a significantly harder time detecting the fatty acid in the drinks than their leaner peers, the study found, with a 40-fold decreased sensitivity for the fat. There was also a correlation between waist size and a higher threshold for being able to detect the fatty acid. . The researchers also used saliva swabs from each child to test for variants of the CD36 gene, which is involved in making the chemical receptors in the taste buds that help recognize fat.  . One variant of the CD36 gene, known as the A allele, is tied to having fewer of the fat receptors, so a person with that allele would, in principle, need more fat to be present before they could detect it. The A allele was more common in the obese children, and was also linked to an increased risk for obesity, according to the results.  . Other studies have linked this variant to liking more high-fat foods, Kathleen Keller, a food science researcher at Pennsylvania State University who wasn’t involved in the research, said by email. . While the exact nature of this interaction is not known, Keller said, it is also possible that regularly eating a high fat diet could be what decreases the fat-taste receptors’ sensitivity over time in obese kids. . To be sure, the study was small and more research is needed in a larger group of kids before drawing broad conclusions, the authors write in the International Journal of Obesity.  . “The variant is significant but needs replication in a large cohort with appropriate controls,” Latisha Love-Gregory, a nutrition researcher at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, said in an email.  . “We do not know if the variant by reducing fat sensitivity would increase or decrease fat intake so it is hard to make dietary recommendations at this point,” said Love-Gregory, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . “Regardless of genetic background, improving the diets of overweight or obese children is paramount in reducing the risk of obesity-associated complications such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension,” she said. .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Military suicides may be more likely after members leave the service than during active duty deployment, particularly if their time in uniform is brief, a U.S. study finds. . “It was certainly intuitive as the wars went on and suicides went up for people to assume that deployment was the reason, but our data show that that is too simplistic; when you look at the total population, deployment is not associated with suicide,” said lead author Mark Reger, of Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington. . While the U.S. military has traditionally experienced lower suicide rates than the civilian population, suicides among active duty service members have surged in the past decade, almost doubling in the Army and the Marines Corps, Reger said. . To understand the link between deployment and suicide, Reger and colleagues analyzed military records for more than 3.9 million service members in active or reserve duty in support of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan at any point from October 7, 2001 to December 31, 2007. . A total of 31,962 deaths occurred, including 5,041 suicides, by December 31, 2009.  . Suicide rates were similar regardless of deployment status. There were 1,162 suicides among those who deployed and 3,879 among those who didn’t, representing suicide rates per 100,000 person-years of 18.86 and 17.78, respectively.  . Leaving the military significantly increased suicide risk, however, with a suicide rate of 26.06 after separating from service compared with 15.12 for those who remained in uniform. Those who left sooner had a greater risk, with a rate of 48.04 among those who spent less than a year in the military.  . Service members with a dishonorable discharge were about twice as likely to commit suicide as those who had an honorable separation.  . “This is the first time such a huge, comprehensive study has found an increased suicide risk among those who have separated from service, particularly if they served for less than four years or had an other than honorable discharge,” said Rajeev Ramchand, a researcher in military mental health and suicide prevention at Rand Corporation who wasn’t involved in the study.  . It’s possible that pre-deployment examinations may screen out people who have mental health problems, making those who deploy several times a healthier, more resilient group, said Dr. Alan Peterson, a psychologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio who specializes in combat-related post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  . “Those who really struggle with a deployment don’t go the second time,” said Peterson, a retired military psychologist who wasn’t involved in the study. “Early separation from the military is often a marker for something else.”  . For those contemplating suicide, access to firearms can exacerbate the problem, Peterson said. “It’s a risk factor that sometimes gets overlooked, but we’ve seen when they don’t have access to weapons they are less likely to kill themselves.” . Some service members who leave the military early may have had risk factors for suicide such as mood disorders or substance abuse problems that contributed to their separation, particularly if they had a dishonorable discharge, said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  . “Some of the dishonorable discharges may be related to having a mental health disorder and being unable to keep that behavior in check and breaking the rules, and some of the early separations may be people in distress who appropriately opted out of service,” said Moutier, who wasn’t involved in the study. . It isn’t realistic to expect former service members to instantly reintegrate into their former civilian lives, but they may be experiencing serious mental health problems if they’re not eating or sleeping or if they’re extremely agitated or irritable, Moutier said. . “The lack of an association between deployment and suicide risk isn’t surprising,” she said. “At a very high level, these findings highlight the need for us to pay closer attention to what happens when people leave the military.” .

Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - When it comes to the wrappers of India’s state-supplied condoms, boring is out, attractive is in, but erotic is too much. . India is readying a redesign of the staid packaging of its half-century-old condom brand, incorporating pictures of handsome men and gorgeous women, in a desperate bid to seduce customers drawn to fancier versions sold by private firms. . The government gives away 650 million ‘Nirodh’ condoms each year in its safe sex campaign, but the text-heavy display and condoms crammed into a white plastic wrapper are a turnoff for many. . “The government-made condom looks sick,” said Vinod Poddar, a taxi driver in the capital, New Delhi, who has avoided the brand for years. “We need looks and quality, and it lacks both.” . To change this perception, India’s health ministry has set up a panel to review pictures as well as more vibrant colors for the wrappers of condoms made by state-owned HLL Lifecare. . The male condom market in India, which has a population of more than 1.2 billion, was worth $152 million by 2011 and is expected to grow 18 percent this year, says market research agency Ken Research. . But Nirodh fell out of favor over the years, in the face of competition from pricier Durex, made by the Reckitt Benckiser Group and KamaSutra, made by the Indian unit of Australia’s Ansell Ltd.. Indian firms TTK Healthcare and Mankind Pharma also sell condoms. . While Durex uses vivid colors on its condom packs, KamaSutra and other Indian brands deploy pictures of scantily clad models. . Although “attractive” is the keyword in conservative India, where many men are still too embarrassed to shop for condoms, health ministry officials vowed not to go too far. . “The packaging will have attractive images of couples, but they will not be erotic,” said one. . The free Nirodh condoms cost the exchequer 1.8 rupees (3 U.S. cents) apiece, but the government is willing to cough up more to boost their appeal to youngsters. In comparison, each Durex condom costs about 12 rupees (20 U.S. cents). . Many villagers shun Nirodh because it’s badly packaged and doesn’t match the quality of rivals, a health worker in the central state of Chhattisgarh told Reuters. . The government vouches for the quality of its condoms, with a health ministry official saying they will be a lot more popular in their new avatar. . “Nirodh is not finding favor right now,” the official said. “But you will be tempted to pick up the product.” |Wed Apr 01 12:35:36 +0000 2015||India to repackage state-supplied condoms in bid to attract users |5.83246332275626e+17|http://reut.rs/1CwGyxE

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Internet search data might someday help estimate the prevalence of non-communicable diseases like stroke, heart disease or cancer, a new study suggests. . Web searches are often linked with behavior, said Svetha Venkatesh, one of the study’s co-authors.  . For example, a trip to the gym may be predicted by a search for the gym’s hours, said Venkatesh, who directs the Center for Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics at Deakin University in Geelong, Australia. . Or an order for food delivery might be predicted by a search for a food delivery company, Venkatesh added. . “A diagnosis or (being) suspicious of heart problems is associated with searching for symptoms, side effects and so on,” Venkatesh said in an email to Reuters Health. . Venkatesh and her coauthors used Google Trends to identify search terms for a one-year period and compared them to U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data on state-based prevalences of risk factors that can predict non-communicable disease, like exercise frequency, tobacco use, diagnosed high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. . Search trends from the previous year, divided by state, were strongly tied to the CDC’s measured estimates of disease risk from population data, the authors wrote March 24 online in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. . In 2011, the web search model predicted that 11.2% of people in Alabama, 9.4% in New Jersey and 8.1% in Nevada had diabetes. Measured values from the CDC for the same year were 11.8%, 8.8% and 10.3%, respectively. . “These may provide a means to understand the response to changes in policy or other interventions in close to real time,” Venkatesh said. . Getting data from search trends could allow for faster changes in healthcare policies and other interventions, instead of waiting for traditional data collection and processing, which can take up to three years, she said. . The web search technique won’t replace hard data measurements, but does help support them at low additional cost, she said. . A similar approach has been used to predict and track influenza on other occasions, she said. . “I’m not surprised that they found an association between search behavior and chronic disease prevalence and it might have some value in predicting prevalence,” said Diane T. Finegood, who leads the Chronic Disease Systems Modeling Lab at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. But, she believes, it may not yet have direct policy making applications. . The prevalence of conditions like diabetes changes slowly, and any policy intervention would only have a notable impact far downstream, she said in an email to Reuters Health.  . Search behavior may be useful as a proxy for behavior change when it closely correlates with CDC measures, Finegood said. . SOURCE: .   .

Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California is suffering from “second-hand smog” drifting in from Asia and other places, researchers said on Tuesday, even as the state’s prolonged drought has made air quality worse. . About 10 percent of ozone pollution, the main ingredient in smog, in the state’s San Joaquin Valley farm region comes from other countries, mostly in Asia, said Ian Faloona, an atmospheric scientist with the University of California, Davis. . “What’s happening upwind strongly affects what’s happening downwind,” Faloona said. If California were a human body, the area around the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco would be the mouth, “breathing in air from across the Pacific Ocean,” he said. . Faloona’s conclusions, which are still preliminary, come during an increase in air pollution in the most populous U.S. state, as drought and warmer temperatures have triggered a spike in the number of winter days thick with soot and dirt. . Faloona presented his findings at a conference near Yosemite National Park in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains. . His research, funded by the San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Management District, looked at pollution at higher elevations. . “Secondhand smog from Asia and other international sources is finding its way into one of the nation’s most polluted air basins, the San Joaquin Valley,” UC Davis said in a news release on Tuesday. . The residents of the San Joaquin Valley have asthma at twice the rate of people in other parts of the state, the university said. Despite considerable improvement in California’s notoriously troublesome air, the San Joaquin Valley recently missed a federal deadline for cleaning up its winter air of sooty particulates, a development blamed on warm, dry conditions and stagnant air. . Last summer, California was out of compliance with federal ozone rules for 99 days in the San Joaquin Valley, up from 89 the year before. Sooty particulates, which cause brown haze in the late autumn and winter, were up throughout the state last winter. . For December 2014 to February 2015, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which covers Los Angeles, reported 24 days that failed to meet federal pollution rules, up from 16 in 2012-2013. . Faloona urged regulators to look beyond regional pollution sources as they try to manage air quality. . “Gradually we’re starting to come to this understanding that pollution is actually of a larger scale than we originally planned for and thought about,” Faloona said. |Tue Mar 31 22:42:17 +0000 2015||California getting 'second-hand smog' from Asia, researchers say |5.830366196215767e+17|http://reut.rs/1CuflvN

Theopolis Waters|CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. pork belly prices are likely to fall further into the summer as supplies climb, now that farmers have finally controlled a deadly virus that wiped out millions of pigs, analysts said. . The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects pork production in 2015 to hit a record 24.09 million pounds as cases of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) wane, triggering an accompanying fall in prices. Hog slaughter and pork output both jumped over 11 percent for the week ending March 28 versus last year. . Increased production should help keep pork belly prices at an average $99 per hundredweight (cwt) during July to September, the height of the bacon-lettuce-tomato-sandwich season, compared with $154.45 a year ago, according to independent market analyst Bob Brown. . PEDv killed at least 8 million pigs in the past two years, roughly 10 percent of the U.S. hog population. But tight biosecurity measures are paying off and incidences of the virus have eased. . “We got a handle on PEDv at the baby pig level,” Brown said. . To counter losses from the virus farmers have been feeding hogs to heavier weights, which is adding to pressure on pork belly and sausage trimming prices. In February, the average carcass basis hog was $61.82 per cwt, a 6-year low, the USDA said. . A strong U.S. dollar is also deterring foreign buyers and raising Canadian imports of pork bellies to the United States. A backlog of pork on West Coast docks following a prolonged labor dispute is adding further pressure. . For the week ending March 28, the wholesale price for 13-to- 17-pound skinless pork bellies averaged $82.16 per cwt, versus $231.47 a year earlier, according to the USDA. . Those lower belly and trimmings prices are making breakfast favorites like bacon and smoked pork sausage cheaper. USDA retail price data for February showed bacon dropped 12 cents per pound from January to $5.47. In June 2014 it reached a record $6.11. . The average price for 42 percent pork trimmings for the week ending March 28 was $21.62 per cwt versus $78.26 last year. In 2015, pork breakfast sausage prices slid to $3.99 by early March after hitting $4.72 per pound in mid-February. |Tue Mar 31 20:58:58 +0000 2015||As deadly pig virus wanes, bacon prices shrink |5.830106229562614e+17|http://reut.rs/1xUqRSB
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – The number of people going to U.S. emergency rooms for constipation has been going up, and so has the cost of those visits, which reached $1.6 billion in 2011, according to a new study. . “Constipation is often thought of as not a serious disease – particularly among doctors. Patients complain about it but it’s often not thought of as being medically that relevant,” said Dr. Anthony Lembo, the study’s senior author from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. . His team’s previous research found that a large number of people were being hospitalized for constipation, and that led them to examine ER visits for the same issue, Lembo told Reuters Health in a phone interview. . “A lot of these people don’t end up getting admitted, obviously, but they’re seen in the ER,” he said. . Constipation affects an estimated 12 to 19 percent of the U.S. population, Lembo and colleagues write in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Symptoms include having fewer than three bowel movements a week, or hard, dry and small bowel movements that are painful or difficult to pass.  . Using data from more than 950 U.S. hospitals, the researchers estimated that there were 497,034 ER visits for constipation during 2006. In 2011, there were 703,391 visits, an increase of about 42 percent. . The increase in ER visits for constipation is greater than the 22 percent increase in overall ER visits during that time, the researchers write. . Infants and the elderly were most likely to wind up in the ER for constipation, which mirrors the condition’s prevalence in general, Lembo said. . Accounting for inflation, the cost of those visits also rose by about 56 percent per patient, from about $1,500 in 2006 to about $2,300 in 2011. . About $1.6 billion was spent on ER care for constipation in 2011, according to those numbers. . The study can’t explain why people come to the ER with constipation, Lembo said. They may have symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, he said. . His team thinks there are probably several reasons why visits for constipation increased, including an increase in the number of people on government-funded insurance. . Those people may be more likely to seek treatment at an ER and less likely to purchase over-the-counter treatments for constipation, the researchers write. . The new study highlights that constipation is a growing healthcare issue in the U.S., said Dr. JoAnn Kwah, a gastroenterologist at Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York. . “One important thing to know about constipation is that it can be due to many different underlying causes so in order to minimize developing this disease, it would be important to know why it’s occurring in the first place,” she told Reuters Health in an email. . Health conditions or medications may cause constipation, said Kwah, who wasn’t involved with the new study. People having issues with constipation should review their medication list with their physician, she said. . Constipation can also be caused by a lack of dietary fiber and Kwah suggests people keep up with the recommended fiber intake of 25 to 30 grams a day. . “This can be done by increasing the amounts of fruits and vegetables in one’s diet, as well as supplementing one’s diet with fiber supplements available from local pharmacies,” she said.   . Dehydration may also lead to constipation, Kwah said. . SOURCE: .

Laila Kearney|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twenty-three New York City doctors and medical workers have been charged with running an insurance fraud scheme in which they persuaded homeless and poor people to get unnecessary medical testing with promises of free shoes, prosecutors said on Tuesday. . Nine doctors and other employees of eight city medical clinics are accused of fraudulently billing Medicaid $7 million in expenses for patients recruited from homeless shelters and welfare centers between October 2012 and September 2014, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said in a statement. . “These defendants allegedly exploited the most vulnerable members of our society and raked in millions of dollars by doing so,” Thompson said in the statement. . The people targeted, referred to by the accused schemers as “guinea pigs,” were given free footwear if they produced a Medicaid card and agreed to have their feet examined at one of the involved medical clinics, prosecutors said. . They were often taken to the clinics for physical therapy and tests including cardiograms that spanned hours and sometimes days, prosecutors said. Patients were also given medical equipment such as leg braces that they did not need. . Daniel Coyne, acting deputy Medicaid inspector general for investigations, said the patients could have had actual and serious medical problems left untreated by getting the arbitrary testing. . The accused face up to 25 years in prison if convicted on the top count of enterprise corruption. A hearing in the case is set for May 19. |Tue Mar 31 20:02:14 +0000 2015||New York doctors accused of using free shoes offer to defraud Medicaid |5.829963451132969e+17|http://reut.rs/1xUdO3y
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Women who live in areas with higher air pollution may also have higher anxiety, according to a new analysis. . “It’s a really interesting finding and definitely suggests that air pollution may be related to mental health,” said lead author Melinda C. Power of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. . “If this is truly causal this is going to have a huge effect on the population because everyone is exposed, but we need more research to build this body of evidence,” Power added. . The researchers used data on more than 70,000 women in the Nurses’ Health Study who filled out an eight-question anxiety survey between ages 57 and 85.  . Overall, about 15 percent of the women had high anxiety symptoms. . Using their previous home addresses from before they filled out the anxiety questionnaire, the researchers were able to estimate the women’s exposure to so-called particulate matter in the air during the past 15 years, based on factors like distance to major roadways, population density, local sources of emissions and wind speeds. . The researchers found no link between anxiety levels and large air pollution particles, but exposure to fine particles was tied to increasing anxiety levels, according to results in BMJ. The more recent the exposure, the higher the level of anxiety tended to be. . For example, women who were exposed to the most small particles in the air one month before their anxiety test were about 12 percent more likely to have high anxiety symptoms, compared to those estimated to be exposed to the least particles one month previously. . Fine particulates come from combustion sources, including cars and power plants, Power told Reuters Health by phone. The smaller the particle, the deeper it may travel into the lungs. . “Our study can only comment on the population level, on average people who were more highly exposed had a higher level of anxiety,” she said. It did not assess distance to pollution sources or the amount of air pollution an individual would need to experience to have increased anxiety. . Since it was an observational study, it does not necessarily indicate that pollution causes anxiety, she said. Women living in more polluted areas may experience other sources of stress that would be linked to anxiety as well. . The authors suspect that fine particulate pollution may be linked to certain subtle conditions, like inflammation, which may increase the risk of anxiety. Further research will need to explore this possibility, and to look for a similar link among men and people of a younger age, Power said. . It is too soon to think about intervening or giving individuals recommendations based on this result, she said. . However, there is substantial evidence that lowering air pollution would improve cardiovascular health and respiratory health and reduce the risk of stroke, she said. Short-term exposure to particulate pollution is tied to an increase in stroke risk according to an analysis of all published research on the subject, which appears in the same issue of BMJ. . The relationship between atmospheric pollution and risk of heart attack and heart failure had already been established, and this new paper, supported by the British Heart Foundation, adds stroke risk to that category, said lead author Dr. Anoop Shah of the University of Edinburgh in the U.K. . There’s not much an individual can do to decrease their exposure to air pollution as it’s ubiquitous, Shah told Reuters Health by phone. But policymakers do have the power to improve public transport systems in urban areas and reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, which are the major source of damaging pollution, he said. . In fact, as reported by Reuters today, Beijing has introduced measures to limit the number of motorists on heavily polluted days. It’s the latest move by authorities there to battle the choking smog that has blanketed the city in recent years. . SOURCES: .  and .

Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - A hot new class of drugs designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein called PD-1 is going to be big - but not nearly as big as investors think, according to a new analysis. . Former top Nomura analyst Amit Roy, who now runs independent research firm Foveal, thinks sales of drugs inhibiting Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1, will sell much less than expected. . “We conclude that the global anti PD-1/PD-L1 market is worth an un-risk-adjusted $10 billion a year, materially less than the optimistic (in our view) $20-30 billion forecasts in the market today,” Roy said in a report on Tuesday. . PD-1 is used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells and the ability to block the protein provides a new weapon in the fight against cancer, prompting multiple drug development programs at leading drugmakers. . But PD-1 inhibitors only work for certain groups of cancer patients and several layers of selection are likely to be needed for patients with cancers such as breast and colorectal. . Roy said this would limit their use and there could be further downside to sales if PD-1 drugs were given for shorter periods than anticipated. . The new drugs are currently prescribed until a patient’s cancer progresses. But there are a growing number of cases of very long responses, suggesting that shorter therapy may be sufficient. . Reducing the duration of therapy to eight to 16 weeks could shrink the value of the PD-1 market to just $2.9 billion to $5.8 billion, Roy said. . Bristol-Myers Squibb’s PD-1 drug Opdivo is viewed as the most promising new medicine to reach the market in 2015, according to a recent Thomson Reuters Cortellis analysis. . Merck also has an approved PD-1 drug, Keytruda, and other PD-1/PD-L1 treatments are under development at range of companies including Roche and AstraZeneca. . Rising sales forecasts for such medicines have been an important driver of share prices in companies in the immuno-oncology space in the last two years. |Tue Mar 31 15:56:58 +0000 2015||New cancer drugs 'vastly overestimated', says contrarian analyst |5.82934619949011e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ct3ii6
|MADRID (Reuters) - Illegal immigrants in Spain will once again be able to get free primary healthcare at doctors’ surgeries, the government said on Tuesday, doing a U-turn on an unpopular policy in a busy election year. . The government withdrew the right to general healthcare for tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in 2012 as part of a program of spending cuts. . But the policy was highly criticized by doctors, refugee activists and opposition parties, and, since the ban excluded emergency treatment, has led to pressure on emergency wards. . “It seems more sensible and more reasonable for (primary healthcare) to be carried out in health centers so that among other things emergency centers are not overwhelmed,” Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told a news conference when asked about the policy change. . Rajoy’s People’s Party is keen to show voters it is serious about reversing austerity policies passed at the peak of the euro zone debt crisis and is at pains to adopt more socially aware measures before elections over the next few months.  . The party did badly in elections in Andalusia this month and there are local and regional elections due in May and September and a general election by the end of the year. . Rajoy, however, insisted illegal immigrants would not be given back their social security health cards, which give cardholders the right to extra care and medicines. According to official data, 800,000 people had their cards withdrawn after the reform was passed in 2012. . “They are not entitled to a health card, as they are not entitled to one in any other EU country,” Rajoy said. |Tue Mar 31 15:56:57 +0000 2015||Spain to reinstate primary healthcare for illegal immigrants |5.829346178896404e+17|http://reut.rs/1xTnQlw
|DAKAR (Reuters) - Broadening access to contraceptives in Africa’s arid Sahel region and improving women’s sexual health are key parts of a $200 million World Bank project in the conservative Muslim region, its coordinator said. . The project in Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Chad, and Ivory Coast seeks to boost long-term prosperity by relieving population pressures on an environment stricken by drought, Christophe Lemiere, coordinator of the Sahel Women’s Empowerment and Demographics Project, told Reuters. . Lemiere said the project aimed at producing a demographic dividend, a rise in living standards resulting from the falling birth rates that lead to a large working-age population with fewer dependents.  . That demographic trend played a major role in the economic ascension of Asian countries like Korea and India between the 1960s and 2000s. But Lemiere said that fertility rates in the Sahel need to drop rapidly. . “To trigger the quick fertility transition, the project is trying to increase the supply and demand of contraceptives,” he said in the recent interview. “That’s where women’s empowerment is kicking in.” . The Sahel belt running south of the Sahara has seen water levels per capita drop 40 percent over the last 20 years, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  . The region is struggling to sustain its fast-growing population, which has the world’s highest fertility rate and has seen its infant mortality rate drop by 25 percent over the last decade.  . Reducing early marriage and childbirth is a priority in a region where a quarter of women aged 15 to 19 are mothers or pregnant. . The project, partnered with the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), aims to increase voluntary family planning by improving access to sexual education for women.  . However, a rise in the working age population will take time to achieve, Lemiere said, particularly in a country like Niger, where nearly half the population is under the age of 15.  . Niger signed a deal for $53 million of funding this month under the project but sexual education is a sensitive topic in the Muslim country. Sex education was dropped from the school syllabus last year after pressure from Islamic leaders. . In Niger, literate females aged 15 to 24 number fewer than half of literate males the same age. Lemiere said righting this unbalance would contribute to reducing fertility rates. . While the project is set to conclude in 2019, he said it could require 10 to 15 years of targeted development to see a positive change.  |Tue Mar 31 15:56:57 +0000 2015||World Bank backs contraception, sexual health in Sahel region |5.829346155827077e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ct3heb
Kathryn Doyle| (Story refiled to add additional affiliation for editorial coauthor introduced in paragraph 10.) . By Kathryn Doyle . (Reuters Health) – Men who eat more fruits and vegetables with pesticide residue have lower sperm counts and a lower percentage of normal sperm, according to a new study. . The researchers studied sperm samples from 155 men who were attending a fertility clinic between 2007 and 2012 because they and their partners were having trouble conceiving.  . The men also answered 131 questions about the food they ate, including how often and in what quantities they ate 38 fruits and vegetables like apples, avocadoes or cantaloupe. The researchers compared their answers to annual U.S. Department of Agriculture data on average pesticide residue in types of produce.   . For example, peppers, spinach, strawberries, apples, and pears tend to have high levels of pesticide residue, whereas peas, beans, grapefruit, and onions have low-to-moderate amounts. . Half the men ate at least 3.5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. . The total amount of fruits and veggies in the diet was not associated with semen quality. But men who ate at least 1.5 servings of high-pesticide produce per day had about half as many sperm in their semen, and two-thirds as many normal-appearing sperm, as men who ate less than half a serving of high-pesticide produce per day, according to results in Human Reproduction.  . “This does not necessarily imply reduced fertility,” said senior author Jorge Chavarro of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “We will continue our work to try to figure out to what extent these effects in semen quality may ultimately impact fertility.” . Pesticide-laden produce was linked to poorer semen quality even when the authors accounted for smoking status and the men’s weight in relation to their height, which can both affect sperm quality. In fact, men who ate more high-pesticide fruits and vegetables tended to exercise more and have a healthier diet overall, Chavarro said. . Other studies had tied poorer semen quality to occupational and environmental exposure to pesticide chemicals, and the latest results indicate the same is true for pesticides in the diet. . Given that pesticides are designed to kill and harm pest reproduction, it is not surprising that they are harmful to human reproduction, said Dr. Hagai Levine of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Hebrew University-Hadassah in Jerusalem , who coauthored an editorial published with the findings. . Recent evidence indicates that sperm quality is an important measure of general health, and poor semen quality predicts higher risk of death, Levine told Reuters Health by email. . “This is an observational study, not an interventional study, so other characteristics, associated both with pesticide-riddled fruit consumption and with semen quality could explain the results,” he said. But the researchers did account for other factors like age, body mass, physical activity, race, smoking, urogenital conditions, season and year, he noted. . “These results do not point to any one specific pesticide or group of pesticides,” Chavarro told Reuters Health by email. “Instead, they suggest that pesticide mixtures, as used in agriculture, may be to blame.” . “Gaining a better understanding on which specific mixtures or pesticides explain this relation will be key moving forward, however,” he said. . He and his team are actively investigating whether women’s markers of fertility may also be linked to pesticides in the diet, he said.  . Organic produce carries less pesticide residue, if you can afford it, he said.  . Another option is to choose fruits and vegetables known to have low levels of pesticide residues, he said. . Some pesticides remain on the surface of produce and may come off when washed, but many others are absorbed into fruit and washing will do nothing in those cases, Chavarro said. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Teens with HIV do better at keeping the virus in check when their parents or guardians come with them for clinic visits, a study from Botswana suggests. . HIV medication regimens can be very complicated. And for more than 90 percent of HIV-infected children and teens in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few government services to support them when parents or other caregivers can’t help, said lead study author Dr. Elizabeth Lowenthal of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.  . “When families and communities do not provide the support that a child needs, there are few options,” she told Reuters Health by email.  . An estimated 2.1 million adolescents, aged 10 to 19, live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in low- and middle-income countries, Lowenthal and colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics. Generally, this age group is less likely to stick with treatment than younger children or adults, the researchers note. . Lowenthal and colleagues studied 300 HIV-positive adolescents coming in for quarterly clinic visits at the Botswana-Baylor Children’s Clinical Center of Excellence beginning in 2012.  Most of them were infected by their mothers during pregnancy or delivery.  . At the start of the study, 50 of the children had detectable viral loads, which can happen when HIV-suppressing medicines aren’t taken consistently or when the body stops responding to the current drug regimen.  . Half the youngsters were no more than 13 years old. And half of them had been receiving HIV treatment for at least seven and a half years. . The study group included 50 orphans who had lost both parents, 85 who had lost their mothers and 70 who’d lost their fathers.  . Overall, 238 youngsters had advanced disease and 199 had advanced or severe immunologic suppression at the start of the study. But 267 had been symptom-free for six months.  . After three months, the virus had become undetectable in about 77 percent of teens who were joined at clinic visits by a parent or guardian, compared with about 57 percent of adolescents who came to the clinic without a parent or guardian.  . When the six-month checkup was also factored in, roughly 89 percent of teens accompanied by a parent or guardian had undetectable virus levels, compared with about 75 percent for those who came without that support. . The study can’t prove that having an adult along for clinic visits is what caused the difference. It can only show, as the authors point out, that “absence of a parent from an adolescent’s clinic visit was strongly associated with HIV virologic failure.”  . It’s common for teens who acquired HIV from their mother during pregnancy or delivery to have one or both parents die from HIV, said Dr. William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in an email.  . “Adherence to a daily drug regimen for a life-long, chronic disease is challenging in the best of settings,” said Moss, who wasn’t involved in the study. “As children transition to adolescence and strive for greater independence, the role of a supportive adult in the home remains critical to maintaining high levels of adherence while at the same time allowing the adolescent to take more responsibility for their own health.” . Strategies that work for teens with other chronic diseases may also help improve treatment compliance for adolescents living with HIV, said Jennifer Dohrn, director of the office of global initiatives at Columbia University School of Nursing, in an email.  . Parents or guardians of teens living with HIV may need to be educated about the challenges of supporting their treatment as they transition to adolescence, and these teens may also need more involvement from peers and friends around their own age, said Dohrn, who wasn’t involved in the study. If they have cell phones, mobile devices might be used for reminders to take daily medications and keep clinic appointments. . “Now that this vulnerability for treatment failure has been identified, there are many ways to tackle how it can be prevented,” Dohrn said.  .

Saliou Samb|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea has detected at least three new cases of Ebola in the alumina hub of Fria, according to the national coordination of the fight against the disease, as authorities blamed popular resistance for hampering the battle against the virus. . The worst detected outbreak of the disease is believed to have killed more than 10,300 people in West Africa, mostly in Guinea, neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . In Guinea, more than 2,200 people are believed to have died since the epidemic was first detected a year ago. Some 50 people remain hospitalized in Ebola treatment centers.  . Following a dip in January, new cases have spiked since early March in and around the capital, prompting officials to announce a new phase of the epidemic in Guinea. . Guinea’s President Alpha Conde announced on Saturday emergency measures enabling authorities to restrict movements in western Guinea in a bid to stem transmission of the disease. . In the report seen by Reuters, authorities cited three new cases in Fria, including one that died in the community, as well as two in the capital Conakry, and one each in the towns of Dubreka and Forecariah. . Fria is home to the only alumina smelter in the West African country, Friguia, which produced some 630,000 tonnes of alumina a year until it was shuttered by Russian aluminium giant RUSAL in 2012. . The report noted the refusal by the local population in Conakry to hand over two other suspected cases, despite the intervention of local authorities. It said families in the town of Coyah, 50 km ( miles) from Conakry had refused to follow contacts of an Ebola case. . The resistance of local communities, which refuse to admit the existence of the disease, has dogged efforts to eradicate Ebola in Guinea since it was detected in March 2014. . “People’s reticence has made us lose a lot of time,” said Naby Youssouf Kiridi Bangoura, a spokesman for the Guinean presidency. He said gendarmes stationed outside Conakry had recently intercepted two bodies hidden under baggage. . Authorities also indicated that 12 Ebola contacts had slipped away from the Conakry suburb of Matoto for the eastern town of Siguiri near the Malian border, Mamou in the center of Guinea and Boke in the west. |Tue Mar 31 14:54:09 +0000 2015||Guinea finds three Ebola cases in the alumina hub of Fria |5.829188104763802e+17|http://reut.rs/1CsSHDM

Katy Migiro|NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human rights groups have welcomed moves to change a Kenyan law passed to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS, which criminalizes pregnant women who pass HIV/AIDS to their babies, saying it discouraged people from finding out their status. . The 2006 law says that a person who knows they are HIV positive must tell “any sexual contact” of their status in advance and could be jailed for seven years if they “knowingly and recklessly” placed another person at risk of being infected. . The High Court ruled this section of the law unconstitutional on March 18 as “it could be interpreted to apply to women who expose or transmit HIV to a child during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding”. . The law was introduced to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS in Kenya, which has the fourth largest HIV positive population in the world - 1.7 million people. . Rights groups argue that it discriminates against women, who are often the first members of a family to find out their HIV status as they are usually tested while pregnant.  . “This law has inflicted fear, shame and punishment on countless Kenyans, especially pregnant women,” Evelyne Opondo, Africa director of the New-York based Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), said in a statement on Monday. . “Now is the time for the Kenya government to immediately amend this legislation and ensure people living with HIV can get the care they need without fear of discrimination or criminalization.” . CCR submitted an amicus brief in a case brought against the government by the AIDS Law Project, a charity providing legal services and counseling to people living with HIV. . The charity argued that the law discourages people from finding out their status and could even prevent those with HIV giving first aid or playing sports for fear of being prosecuted. . The law also puts women at risk of violence or rejection by their husbands because it allows doctors to disclose patients’ status to their next of kin, it said.  . “If we want to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS and put an end to the stigma, violence and discrimination surrounding the disease, our public policies must be based on medical evidence and grounded in human rights,” Jacinta Nyachae, executive director of the AIDS Law Project, said in the statement. . The High Court advised the government to review the law to avoid further litigation.  |Tue Mar 31 13:12:50 +0000 2015||Kenya court urges change to law criminalizing women who pass HIV to baby |5.828933126774129e+17|http://reut.rs/1xSRiIm
|GENEVA (Reuters) - Members of the Saudi-led coalition conducting air strikes in Yemen are preventing a Red Cross plane from delivering medical supplies in Sanaa, an ICRC spokeswoman said on Tuesday. . In a statement, the independent aid agency “called for the urgent removal of obstacles to the delivery to Yemen of vital medical supplies needed to treat casualties from a week of deadly clashes and air strikes”. . “We still don’t have the permission from coalition members,” ICRC spokeswoman Sitara Jabeen told Reuters in Geneva, declining to specify which coalition authorities were responsible for the hold-up. . The aircraft, carrying enough medical supplies to treat from 700 to 1,000 wounded, is still in Djibouti, she said. It is due to fly to Amman, Jordan to load supplies from an ICRC warehouse before flying to Sanaa, once guarantees are received. . “So far efforts to negotiate the safe arrival of the plane have not been successful,” the statement said, adding that supplies for treating the war wounded are running low at hospitals across Yemen.  . For six days, a Saudi-led coalition has bombed Iran-allied Houthi fighters and army units fighting against President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose last bastion in the southern city of Aden was heavily shelled overnight. . “An ICRC surgical team is due to arrive shortly in the southern city of Aden, where casualty numbers have been greatest,” the ICRC said. |Tue Mar 31 11:49:14 +0000 2015||Coalition stopping Red Cross delivering medical aid in Yemen: spokeswoman |5.828722772697825e+17|http://reut.rs/1CsnPDy

Adam Jourdan|SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will almost double the number of its general doctors by 2020, trim its public sector and improve technology as it seeks to fix a healthcare system plagued by snarling queues and poor rural services, its main administrative authority has said. . China’s fast-growing healthcare market is a magnet for global drug makers, medical device firms and hospital operators, all looking to take a slice of a healthcare bill expected to hit $1 trillion by 2020, according to McKinsey & Co.  . “Healthcare resources overall are insufficient, quality is too low, our structures are badly organized and service systems fragmented. Parts of the public hospital system have also become bloated,” China’s State Council said in a five-year roadmap announced late on Monday. . The roadmap, which laid out targets for healthcare officials nationwide between 2015 and 2020, said Beijing wanted to have two general doctors per thousand people by 2020, close to double the number at the end of 2013, as well as increasing the number of nursing and support staff. . China suffers from a scarcity of doctors - partly caused by low salaries - which has created bottlenecks at popular urban hospitals leading to rising tension between medical practitioners and often frustrated patients. . The roadmap said China would also look to use technology such as mobile devices and online “cloud systems” to meet some of the issues, a potential boost to tech firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and its healthcare subsidiary Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd. . China should also have digital databases for electronic health records and patient information covering the entire population to some degree by 2020, it said. . Providing access to affordable healthcare is a key platform for President Xi Jinping’s government. However, recent probes have turned the spotlight on corruption in the sector, while patients often have large out-of-pocket expenses due to low levels of insurance coverage. . The roadmap said China would push forward the development of grassroots healthcare, a fast-growing business segment, while reining in some large public hospitals in urban centers.  . The document also suggested further opening to the private sector, where Chinese and international firms have been taking a growing role in running hospitals. . “The role of public health institutions is too big, with the number of beds accounting for around 90 percent of the total,” the State Council said. |Tue Mar 31 05:42:20 +0000 2015||China aims to double doctor numbers as cure for healthcare woes |5.827799439244411e+17|http://reut.rs/1xRuSHj
|SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s healthcare subsidiary will tie-up with Zhejiang DiAn Diagnostics Co Ltd to help develop an online hospital platform, the diagnostics firm said in a filing late on Monday. . The firm said it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd to explore an online health testing platform - part of Ali Health’s drive to take healthcare services online. . Ali Health is looking to leverage technology to overhaul China’s fragmented healthcare market, which suffers from an under-supply of doctors, snarling queues and a wide gap between urban and rural healthcare. . “The two sides will use mobile internet technologies, and leverage the natural strengths of our respective models and technologies to break through the limitations in the e-commerce healthcare sphere,” Zhejiang DiAn said in the statement. . The firm focuses on medical diagnostics, including laboratory testing and health examinations. . Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. . Ali Health, which has also recently tied up with a local pharmacy chain and a software firm, is eyeing a slice of China’s online pharmaceutical market as the country gears up to remove restrictions over the sale of prescription drugs online - a potentially a multi-billion dollar market. . Beijing is trying to overhaul its healthcare market and stretch already thin resources create accessible and affordable healthcare for its near 1.4 billion people. China’s healthcare bill is estimated to hit $1 trillion by 2020. .

David Schwartz|PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona Republican Governor Doug Ducey signed a law on Monday that requires doctors to tell women that drug-induced abortions can be reversed and that blocks the purchase of insurance on the Obamacare health exchange that includes abortion coverage. . The requirement that patients be told that the effects of abortion pills may be undone by using high doses of a hormone was the most hotly contested provision during legislative debate. . Supporters said there was ample evidence the reversal was possible if acted upon quickly, although they provided no peer-reviewed studies in support of their position. . Critics called the argument “junk science.”  . The bill cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature last week, largely along party lines. . In December, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked Arizona from enforcing a state law that restricted access to abortion-inducing drugs by prohibiting off-label uses of RU-486, known as the “abortion pill.” . In a statement regarding the bill’s provision barring women from buying coverage on the federal healthcare exchange that includes abortion, Ducey said: “The American people overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of abortions, and it’s no different in Arizona, where we have long-standing policy against subsidizing them with public dollars.” . Opponents said there was no proof public dollars had been used for the elective procedures and called the measure an overreach. . Bryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, said the bill’s signing again put Arizona in a bad light for “interfering in the medical decisions of women,” and vowed to keep opposing the law through “all of our options, including litigation.” . Supporters of the measure, which exempts cases of incest, rape and life-saving situations, said the ban was needed because many individuals insured through the federally run exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, received government subsidies. . “Countless more lives will be saved, and women spared a lifetime of regret,” said Cathi Herrod, president of the conservative Center for Arizona Policy. |Tue Mar 31 00:49:29 +0000 2015||Arizona governor says he has signed abortion bill into law |5.827062458549821e+17|http://reut.rs/1xQGLx3
|LONDON (Reuters) - One in five teenagers have experimented with e-cigarettes, a large study of British school students showed on Tuesday, fuelling debate about the widespread availability of the electronic devices. . Many experts view the metal tubes that heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapor as a lower-risk alternative to smoking. But questions remain about long-term safety and their use among impressionable adolescents. . In a survey of more than 16,000 people aged 14-17 years in northwest England in 2013, 19.2 percent said they had tried or purchased e-cigarettes, according to a paper published in the journal BMC Public Health. . E-cigarette use, or “vaping”, was highest among smokers, reaching 75.8 percent in those with a habit of at least five a day, although 15.8 percent of teenage vapers had never smoked conventional cigarettes. . Karen Hughes of the Centre for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University and other authors of the study said the research suggested experimentation, rather than a desire to quit smoking, was the main driver of teen use. . “There is an urgent need for controls on the promotion and sale of e-cigarettes to children,” they concluded. . Wilson Compton of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse wrote in an accompanying commentary that e-cigarettes, at least for some groups, were adding a new recreational drug experience to an existing repertoire of risky behaviors. . Other experts, however, cautioned against jumping to conclusions, particularly since the study did not follow up to see whether children continued to use e-cigarettes after experimenting with initial puffs. . “Other surveys have so far found that progressing from ever trying an e-cigarette to regular use amongst non-smoking children is very rare or entirely absent, suggesting that, to date, e-cigarettes are not responsible for creating a new generation of nicotine addicts,” said Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling. . More than 2 million adults use e-cigarettes in Britain, about one third of whom are ex-smokers and two-thirds current smokers, according to the charity Action on Smoking and Health. . Nearly all big tobacco companies - including Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco Group - now sell e-cigarettes to diversify away from the market for traditional cigarettes, which is shrinking as more people quit or cut back.        |Tue Mar 31 00:33:40 +0000 2015||One in five teens have tried e-cigarettes, a British study finds |5.827022658757673e+17|http://reut.rs/1xQFc2r
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters) - Men who eat more fruits and vegetables with pesticide residue have lower sperm counts and a lower percentage of normal sperm, according to a new study. . The researchers studied sperm samples from 155 men who were attending a fertility clinic between 2007 and 2012 because they and their partners were having trouble conceiving.  . The men also answered 131 questions about the food they ate, including how often and in what quantities they ate 38 fruits and vegetables like apples, avocadoes or cantaloupe. The researchers compared their answers to annual U.S. Department of Agriculture data on average pesticide residue in types of produce.   . For example, peppers, spinach, strawberries, apples, and pears tend to have high levels of pesticide residue, whereas peas, beans, grapefruit, and onions have low-to-moderate amounts. . Half the men ate at least 3.5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. . The total amount of fruits and veggies in the diet was not associated with semen quality. But men who ate at least 1.5 servings of high-pesticide produce per day had about half as many sperm in their semen, and two-thirds as many normal-appearing sperm, as men who ate less than half a serving of high-pesticide produce per day, according to results in Human Reproduction.  . “This does not necessarily imply reduced fertility,” said senior author Jorge Chavarro of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “We will continue our work to try to figure out to what extent these effects in semen quality may ultimately impact fertility.” . Pesticide-laden produce was linked to poorer semen quality even when the authors accounted for smoking status and the men’s weight in relation to their height, which can both affect sperm quality. In fact, men who ate more high-pesticide fruits and vegetables tended to exercise more and have a healthier diet overall, Chavarro said. . Other studies had tied poorer semen quality to occupational and environmental exposure to pesticide chemicals, and the latest results indicate the same is true for pesticides in the diet. . Given that pesticides are designed to kill and harm pest reproduction, it is not surprising that they are harmful to human reproduction, said Dr. Hagai Levine of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who coauthored an editorial published with the findings. . Recent evidence indicates that sperm quality is an important measure of general health, and poor semen quality predicts higher risk of death, Levine told Reuters Health by email. . “This is an observational study, not an interventional study, so other characteristics, associated both with pesticide-riddled fruit consumption and with semen quality could explain the results,” he said. But the researchers did account for other factors like age, body mass, physical activity, race, smoking, urogenital conditions, season and year, he noted. . “These results do not point to any one specific pesticide or group of pesticides,” Chavarro told Reuters Health by email. “Instead, they suggest that pesticide mixtures, as used in agriculture, may be to blame.” . “Gaining a better understanding on which specific mixtures or pesticides explain this relation will be key moving forward, however,” he said. . He and his team are actively investigating whether women’s markers of fertility may also be linked to pesticides in the diet, he said.  . Organic produce carries less pesticide residue, if you can afford it, he said.  . Another option is to choose fruits and vegetables known to have low levels of pesticide residues, he said. . Some pesticides remain on the surface of produce and may come off when washed, but many others are absorbed into fruit and washing will do nothing in those cases, Chavarro said. . SOURCE: .

Nate Raymond|NEW YORK (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc has agreed to settle a lawsuit by Johnson & Johnson accusing it of using false advertising at the start of the U.S. allergy season to grab market share. . The settlement was disclosed during a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Monday in which two Johnson & Johnson units were expected to ask a judge to block Glaxo from making various claims about its allergy nasal spray Flonase, records show.  . Representatives for Johnson & Johnson and Glaxo in separate statements called the settlement “mutually acceptable and amicable.” The terms were confidential, they said. . Glaxo received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell Flonase over the counter in July, setting the stage for greater competition. . J&J units McNeil-PPC Inc and McNeil Consumer Healthcare filed the lawsuit on March 12, accusing Glaxo of making unsupported claims about Flonase at the expense of McNeil’s drugs Benadryl and Zyrtec. . A Glaxo TV spot cited in the lawsuit said that Flonase outperforms the No. 1 allergy pill, which the ad does not name, and controls six allergy symptoms versus one by the other pill. . The McNeil units said studies do not support the claims. McNeil said it stood to be harmed with the prime allergy sales season quickly approaching, and sought an injunction. . The case is McNeil-PPC Inc and McNeil Consumer Healthcare v. GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare LP, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 15-1866. |Mon Mar 30 22:27:57 +0000 2015||J&amp;J, Glaxo settle U.S. lawsuit over allergy ads |5.826706243734897e+17|http://reut.rs/1xQrBIj
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – - The rate of people being diagnosed or killed by cancer in the U.S. is stable or decreasing for men and women, according to a new report. . “For the main cancers, it’s really pretty much good news, incidence and mortality is decreasing,” said Recinda Sherman, an author of the new report from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) in Springfield, Illinois. . A highlight of the report is that for the first time it breaks breast cancer into specific groups based on how it responds to hormones, said Ahmedin Jemal, vice president of surveillance and health service research at the American Cancer Society (ACS). . The type of breast cancer largely dictates which treatment approach doctors will take, he told Reuters Health by phone. “This is really a nutshell what is special about this annual report to the nation.” . “This is an assessment of the burden of subtypes and in the future we’ll be able to look at these trends and see what’s going up and what’s going down,” Sherman said. . She added that the report can provide guidance in where to focus resources to educate the public. For example, she said so-called triple-negative breast cancer, which is the most aggressive type, represents about 13 percent of breast cancers for all women, but represents about 23 percent of breast cancers among black women. . Because triple-negative breast cancer is less likely to be caught by mammography, Sherman said there may be opportunities to target black women with messaging about that specific type of breast cancer.     . The analysis, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is the latest in a series of annual reports on cancer compiled since 1998 by the NAACCR, the ACS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute. . The organizations found decreases over the past 20 years in the number of new cases for several of the major cancers diagnosed among men, including prostate, lung, colon, stomach, brain and throat cancers. There were also decreases among colon, ovary, cervix, oral and stomach cancers among women. . Overall, cancer diagnoses decreased by 1.8 percent each year between 2007 and 2011 among men, and remained stable among women. . Among children, cancer diagnosis rates continue to increase at about 0.8 percent each year over the last decade, which is a trend that has remained steady since 1992. . For children and adults, however, overall death rates from cancer declined. . There are areas of concern, Sherman told Reuters Health in a phone interview. . For example, liver cancers are increasing, likely due to an increase in hepatitis C infections that goes back decades. . “A couple decades ago, the rate of hepatitis C infections increased and that in turn is being reflected in liver cancer rates,” Sherman said. Fortunately, two of the biggest risk factors for liver cancer are hepatitis C infection and alcohol abuse, which are preventable and treatable, she said. . There has also been an increase in uterine cancers, with a larger increase among black women. Sherman said it’s unclear what’s behind those trends. . There are bright spots, too. For example, lung and colorectal cancer rates continue to improve. . The improvement in lung cancer rates is connected with the decreasing use of tobacco, Sherman said, adding that colorectal rates are likely tied to increased screenings among the public. . “We continue to make progress in reducing cancer death rates in the U.S.,” said Jemal. “You can already see from the report that the rates have been decreasing overall since the 1990s.” . Sherman also said that while the report is largely positive, cancer remains a enormous burden to the U.S. population. . “Our work is not even close to being done, because many of these disease are preventable,” Sherman said. .

|FREETOWN (Reuters) - A three-day lockdown in Sierra Leone has exposed hundreds of potential new cases of Ebola, aiding efforts to bring to an end an epidemic that has already killed 3,000 people in the country. . Officials ordered the country’s 6 million residents to stay indoors or face arrest during the period that ended late on Sunday as hundreds of health officials went door-to-door looking for hidden patients and educating residents about the virus. . Reports to authorities of sick people increased by 191 percent in Western Area, which includes the capital, during the lockdown compared with the previous weekend, said Obi Sesay of the National Ebola Response Center. . “Tests are being carried out on their blood samples, and the results will be in by Wednesday,” Sesay said, adding that 173 of the patients in Freetown met an initial case definition for Ebola. . In the rest of the country, there was a 50 percent increase in sick people reported in the lockdown’s first two days, Sesay said. . Sierra Leone has reported nearly 12,000 cases since the worst Ebola epidemic in history was detected in neighboring Guinea a year ago. In all, more than 10,000 people have died in the two countries plus Liberia. . New cases have fallen since a peak of more than 500 a week in December, but the government said the lockdown, its second, would help identify the last cases and reduce complacency. . A source who declined to be identified said there were 961 death alerts nationwide during the lockdown’s first two days and 495 reports of illness of which 235 were suspected Ebola. |Mon Mar 30 18:19:55 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone Ebola lockdown exposes hundreds of suspected cases |5.826082048630538e+17|http://reut.rs/1CpY72v
|(Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis NOVN.VX is digging deeper into cancer immunotherapy, one of the hottest areas of drug research, through a tie-up with Aduro Biotech (. ) worth up to $750 million. . The move comes as the privately owned California-based biotech group prepares for a $86 million initial public offering (IPO), details of which were announced earlier this month.  . Novartis will make an upfront payment of $200 million and Aduro could be eligible for a further $500 million if drug projects pan out. . In addition, Novartis is making an initial equity investment in Aduro of $25 million, with a commitment for another $25 million at a future date, the two companies said on Monday. . The move gives Novartis access to Aduro’s experimental STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) technology, which is a next-generation method to harness the body’s immune system to combat cancer.  . In a further sign of its commitment to cancer immunotherapy, Novartis also launched an immuno-oncology research group led by Glenn Dranoff, a leading cancer vaccine expert from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  . The Basel-based group is already working on a number of immunotherapies to fight cancer, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART), where its CTL019 product is in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials and is viewed as a potential market leader. . Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, said the new technologies could be used both on their own and in combination with other medicines. . “Current approaches with checkpoint inhibitors and T-cell modulation are potent but only in select tumor types. STING agonists have the potential to fully activate the immune system to attack a broader range of tumors,” Fishman said. . Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum said Novartis’s strategy was to target the 50 percent or so of cancer patients whose tumors are unlikely to respond to drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, which have formed the first wave of immuno-oncology treatments.   . Aduro will lead commercialization and will book sales from any eventual products in the United States, with Novartis taking the lead in the rest of the world. The companies will share in profits in the United States, Japan and major European countries, with Novartis will paying Aduro a royalty for sales in the rest of the world.  |Mon Mar 30 17:12:21 +0000 2015||Novartis digs deeper into cancer with up to $750 million Aduro deal |5.82591203272704e+17|http://reut.rs/1CpMZCI
Tova Cohen|TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it would buy U.S. neurology drug company Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc for an equity value of $3.5 billion to boost its portfolio of treatments for the central nervous system. . Teva, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, will offer $101 per share in cash, representing a premium of 42.4 percent to Auspex’s Friday closing price, the companies said on Monday.   . In February Teva - Israel’s biggest company by market value and revenue - said it was ready to return to making acquisitions after a year focused on cutting costs under its new chief executive, Erez Vigodman.   . This is the first major deal for Vigodman, a turnaround specialist brought in last year to reduce costs and improve profit that had been squeezed by rising competition.  . Teva’s biggest selling drug, multiple sclerosis injectable treatment Copaxone, faces competition from oral treatments and cheaper generics in coming years. . Shares in Auspex were up 41.7 percent to $100.51 in morning trade, while Teva shares were up 3 percent at $63.86. . Bernstein analyst Aaron Gal said the acquisition was a good strategic fit for Teva as the company looks to boost growth, and also leaves financial room for a bigger deal in future. . “To the extent Teva would like to make a transformative deal in the generic space, this deal is small enough not to impact that potential,” Gal said. . Auspex’s main product, SD-809, is being developed for the treatment of chorea, abnormal involuntary movement associated with Huntington’s disease, tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome. SD-809 for Huntington’s is expected to win regulatory approval and be launched commercially in 2016, Teva said. . An estimated 30,000 people in the United States suffer from Huntington’s, 350,000 from tardive dyskinesia and 150,000 from Tourette, for which the drug is in early stage trials. Auspex has another drug being developed for Parkinson’s disease. . Teva said it expected the Auspex deal, which will be financed with cash on hand, to add to revenue from 2016 and to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) beginning in 2017. It will be “meaningfully accretive” thereafter, the company added. . It estimated sales of $2 billion from Auspex products in 2020. It expects minimal dilution to adjusted EPS in the second half of 2015 and 2016. . Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore said the acquisition would fit well with Teva’s own neurology commercial and development infrastructure. . “The bottom line is that options remain and Teva is now finally on the offence,” he said, adding he hoped even more aggressive deals would be considered. . Michael Hayden, Teva’s chief scientific officer, said Auspex’s technology could represent “a significant breakthrough for patients who often have no sustainable symptom relief from their disease”. . The transaction has been approved by the boards of Teva and Auspex and key shareholders of California-based Auspex have entered into agreements indicating support for the deal. Teva expects it will close in mid-2015. . Goldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Teva and J.P. Morgan Securities is the exclusive financial adviser to Auspex. |Mon Mar 30 16:34:02 +0000 2015||Teva to buy U.S. drug developer Auspex Pharma for $3.5 billion |5.825815619016049e+17|http://reut.rs/1xPBqq0
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Between 2003 and 2010, the number of U.S. kids eating fast food on any given day went down, and the calories from some types of fast foods have declined as well, according to a new study. . “Most prior studies have focused on menu items, but this (one) actually looked at what children are eating,” said coauthor Colin D. Rehm, formerly of the University of Washington in Seattle and now of Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.  . “The take-home message is that changes can be made, whether they are due to consumer preference or due to what the restaurants have done themselves,” Rehm told Reuters Health by phone. “It shows that change is possible.” . According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, in 2003, almost 39 percent of U.S. kids ate fast food on a given day, which dropped to less than 33 percent by the 2009-2010 survey. . Calorie intake from burger, pizza and chicken fast food restaurants also went down, while those from Mexican foods and sandwiches did not change. . Mexican food and sandwiches were minor contributors to total fast food consumption to start with, so it would have been difficult to detect a decrease over the course of the study, Rehm noted. . Other sources have noted a decline in pizza sales since 2003, which may explain some of the decrease in frequency and calories from those sources, the authors write in JAMA Pediatrics.  . Increased consumer nutrition awareness and restaurant reformulations of menu items or portion downsizing also likely contributed to the trend, Rehm said.  . “Menu labeling” with calorie information had really only just begun in 2010, so it would not have had a sizeable effect on these data, he said.  . “Given that fast food intake appears to be declining among adults, it’s not surprising that we’d see a similar trend in children,” said Katherine W. Bauer of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia. . Bauer was not involved in the new study. . By 2010, fewer kids were visiting pizza restaurants every day, and when they did, they tended to consume fewer calories. For burgers, calories decreased but the percentage of visitors per day did not, indicating that kids, or their parents, started making lower-calorie choices at burger restaurants, Rehm said. . Reduced frequency of fast food intake and reduced caloric contributions from fast food are positive signs for health, Bauer told Reuters Health by email.  . “From this paper alone I don’t feel we’re able to say that kids are getting healthier, because we don’t know what, if anything, they’re substituting for their fast food meals and snacks,” she said. “If children are substituting the calories from fast food for the same number of calories and quality of food from another type of restaurant, then they’re no better off.” . This study only looked at calories and did not consider the nutrition profile of the foods, which is important, he noted. U.S. dietary goals should be to reduce calories and to improve the nutritional value of those calories, Rehm said. . “We’re definitely getting a number of positive signs from around the country that our public health efforts to address obesity and improve children’s nutrition may be working, including what we see in this paper,” Bauer said. . Other studies have noted a decrease in kids’ overall calorie consumption as well as added sugar consumption, Rehm said. . “There’s always room for improvement in the American diet, but we are seeing some encouraging results,” he said. .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - An apple a day might not keep the doctor away, but it might help keep the pharmacist at bay, a new study suggests. . “Everybody thinks of the apple as a healthy food, and it is, but after adjusting for other variables we didn’t find a difference in doctor visits between apple eaters and non-apple eaters,” said Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan School of Nursing in Ann Arbor, who led the study. . Davis and colleagues set out to tackle a light-hearted question: is a proverb about apples that dates back to at least the 1800s really true? . To find the answer, they compared apple eaters to abstainers, using data from 8,399 U.S. adults who completed questionnaires between 2007 and 2010 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). . Just 753 participants, or 9 percent, ate at least one small apple day. People who only consumed apples in the form of juice, applesauce or pie were considered non-apple eaters for the purposes of the study, Davis said. . Apple eaters in the study had higher educational attainment, were more likely to be from a racial or ethnic minority, and were less likely to smoke. . And at first blush, apple eaters seemed more likely to keep the doctor away, with fewer self-reported visits to health care providers. But the difference wasn’t statistically significant after adjusting for socioeconomic factors and other health characteristics. . The apple eaters did appear to be significantly more likely to avoid prescription medications. Curiously, the link was slightly stronger for people who consumed small- or medium-sized apples than it was with large apples. . An estimated 19.3 million U.S. adults consume the equivalent of about 26.9 million small apples daily, weighing about 8.8 million pounds, the researchers calculated. . Based on the cost per pound of one popular variety of apple, Red Delicious, and the typical amount U.S. adults spend on prescriptions, the researchers say it’s possible that convincing the 207.2 million abstainers to eat an apple a day might result in a net savings of as much $19.2 billion.  . Limitations of the study include its reliance on self-reports of apple consumption, doctor visits and prescriptions. And the research only explores a link between eating apples and possible uses of health services, not a causal relationship. . “While it does have some scientific basis, checking out whether an apple a day keeps the doctor away isn’t your typical scientific hypothesis to test,” said Dr. Rita Redberg, editor-in-chief of JAMA Internal Medicine, the journal that published the study. . It’s possible that people who eat apples have healthier habits than people who don’t but there are indeed some health benefits associated with apples, Dr. Michael Roizen, chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said in an email interview.  . “Apples are an excellent source of fiber and are low in calories, which means they will satisfy your hunger and keep you fuller for a longer period of time,” said Roizen, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The best way to get the nutritional benefits of apples is by consuming one medium-sized apple per day.” . There are more than 7,500 varieties of apples around the world with varying levels of polyphenols, healthy plant chemicals that account for the color, flavor, anti-oxidant activity and other health benefits, said Samantha Heller, a nutritionist at NYU Langone Medical Center, in an email interview.  . Apples have been linked to a reduced risk several forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma, said Heller, who wasn’t involved in the study. In addition, they may have beneficial effects for Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, weight management and bone health. . But they’re no cure-all. . “Eating an apple a day is unlikely to undo the ill effects of the typical ‘Western diet’ that is high in red and processed meat, junk food and fast food and low in plant foods,” Heller said.  .

|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court imposed a permanent injunction on a Los Angeles-based seafood company after food inspectors found contamination by the listeria bacteria, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Monday. . U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections of L.A. Star Seafood Inc in 2013 and 2014 found unsanitary conditions that resulted from insufficiently cleaning surfaces and utensils used on fish, the department said. . The most recent inspection found that the company had not followed best practices to prevent other types of contamination. L.A. Star Seafood imports, prepares, processes, packs and distributes smoked and salt-cured seafood, the Justice Department said. . The agency said it filed a complaint in January in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The seafood company agreed to be bound by a consent decree that requires it to cease operations until the FDA determines its manufacturing practices are safe. .

|(Reuters) - GNC Holdings Inc said it restored certain herbal supplements to its stores in New York after reaching an agreement with the state’s attorney general that its products complied with the Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines. . GNC also agreed to adopt testing standards for herbal supplements that exceed FDA requirements, a first in the United States, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. . The end of a dispute that started on Feb. 2 sent the company’s shares up as much as 8 percent to a 52-week high of $49.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. . The company did not have to pay any monetary damages, just implement reforms, Elizabeth DeBold, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s office said. . GNC was one of four retailers that halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by Schneiderman as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials that the companies claimed were a part of their supplements. . Both internal and independent third-party tests had proved that GNC’s “products are safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements”, the company said in a statement on Monday. . GNC had said earlier that tests showed its products contained all herbal extracts listed on labels, and on Monday the company said it had restarted selling its Herbal Plus products. . A study commissioned by the Attorney General to determine the presence or absence of the DNA of certain plants in some herbal supplements also found GNC’s products were within prescribed FDA guidelines, Schneiderman’s statement said. . GNC will start DNA barcoding within 18 months to confirm the authenticity of all plants used as sources for its herbal supplements prior to processing, Schneiderman said. . The company would test for allergen contamination pre and post production and had also agreed to prominently disclose in its stores and on its website if a supplement product was derived from whole herbs or extracts, Schneiderman said. . Herbal Plus is part of GNC’s vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements business, which accounts for almost 40 percent of its U.S. retail revenue. . The investigation into the supplements sold by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp was ongoing, DeBold said. . Walgreens was reviewing the matter and intends to continue cooperating with the Attorney General’s office, spokesperson James Graham said. . Wal-Mart and Target were not available for comment. |Mon Mar 30 12:28:39 +0000 2015||GNC Holdings strikes deal with NY Attorney General over herbal supplements |5.825198068234035e+17|http://reut.rs/1xOR5pq
Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Feet are a part of the anatomy many exercisers ignore while pounding the treadmill or honing a headstand, but fitness experts say they are the very foundation of physical well-being. . A quarter of the body’s bones are contained in the feet and ankles. It is where most movement begins and, much like a building’s foundation, it determines stability. . “The feet are perhaps the most neglected complex structure in the body,” said Katy Bowman, biomechanist and the author of “Whole Body Barefoot: Transitioning Well to Minimal Footwear.”  . Bowman, founder and director of the Restorative Exercise Institute near Seattle, Washington, said when feet are  strengthened it decreases whole body imbalance or instability. . Almost eight in 10 adult Americans have experienced a foot problem, according to a 2014 survey by the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA). The poll also showed that one in four adults was unable to exercise because of foot pain. . Dr. Howard Osterman, an APMA spokesman, said most foot injuries are due to overuse, or trying to do too much with limited support.  . “We don’t need the toes to have the dexterity of fingers but we do need some dexterity,” he said. “We need the muscles to have strength.” . As a podiatric consultant to the Washington Wizards professional basketball team, Osterman recommends that team trainers make sure players do their foot exercises religiously. . Simply trying to pick up a washcloth, towel or marbles with the feet fires up the muscles that build arch strength, he said. Standing on one foot for 10 seconds is also a good way to build core strength. . “(It) stimulates the nerve endings from the brain down to the small nerves in the feet,” he said. “It’s especially important to train the brain of elderly people at a greater risk of falls.” . Bowman suggests doing exercises such as spreading, pointing and individually lifting the toes, rolling a tennis ball underfoot, and standing on tiptoe to strengthen the calves.  . “For the fit person, give yourself a 15-minute foot exercise routine that you do without your shoes,” she recommends. . Bowman believes foot fitness is integral to every movement. . “Every exerciser is worried about the position of their ankles, knees and hips, but so much of that stability starts at the foot,” she said. “It’s very much a whole body issue.” |Mon Mar 30 12:28:38 +0000 2015||Feet: the foundation for fitness and health |5.825198050701926e+17|http://reut.rs/1xOR5ps
Tova Cohen|TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it would buy U.S. biopharmaceutical firm Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc for an equity value of $3.5 billion to boost its portfolio of treatments for the central nervous system. . Teva, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, will offer $101 per share in cash, representing a premium of 42.4 percent to Auspex’s Friday closing price, the companies said on Monday. . In February Teva said it was ready to return to making acquisitions after a year focused on cutting costs under its new chief executive, Erez Vigodman. . This is the first major deal for Vigodman, a turnaround specialist brought in last year to reduce costs and improve profit that had been squeezed by rising competition. . Teva said it expected the deal, to be financed with cash on hand, to add to revenue from 2016 and to adjusted earnings per share beginning in 2017. It will be “meaningfully accretive” thereafter, Teva added. . Teva estimated sales of $2 billion from Auspex products in 2020. It expects minimal dilution to adjusted EPS in the second half of 2015 and 2016. . Shares in Auspex were up 41.7 percent to $100.5 in early trade, while Teva shares were up 1 percent at $62.6.  . The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of Teva and Auspex and key shareholders of California-based Auspex have entered into agreements indicating their support for the transaction. Teva, Israel’s biggest company, expects the transaction will close in mid-2015. . Auspex’s main product, SD-809, is being developed for the  treatment of chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement associated with Huntington’s disease, tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome. SD-809 for Huntington’s is expected to win regulatory approval and be launched commercially in 2016, Teva said. . An estimated 30,000 people in the United States suffer from Huntington’s, 350,000 from tardive dyskinesia and 150,000 from Tourette, for which the drug is in early stage trials. Auspex has another drug being developed for Parkinson’s disease. . Michael Hayden, Teva’s chief scientific officer, said Auspex’s technology “could represent a significant breakthrough for patients who often have no sustainable symptom relief from their disease”. . Goldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Teva and J.P. Morgan Securities is the exclusive financial adviser to Auspex. |Mon Mar 30 11:27:56 +0000 2015||Teva to buy U.S. drug developer Auspex Pharma for $3.5 billion |5.825045295241011e+17|http://reut.rs/1IeYiz5
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government next year plans to begin collecting more detailed data on antibiotics used on farms in a potential precursor to set targets for reduced use of the drugs in animals. . The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is waiting for approval of federal funding to add questions about antibiotics to annual surveys of livestock producers as part of a bid to determine the most-complete national usage estimates ever in cattle, hogs and poultry, according to the agency. . The data drive comes amid increasing concerns among researchers about the deadly problem of antibiotic resistance in humans. An estimated 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States are administered to livestock, not to people, but existing government surveys collect limited information about usage on farms. . The enhanced surveys are expected to ask producers which livestock were given antibiotics and why, according to the Animal Health Institute, which represents pharmaceutical companies like Zoetis Inc and Elanco, the animal-health division of Eli Lilly and Co. The responses could then be used as a baseline to set targets for reduced use. . Consumer and environmental groups said a White House report issued on Friday failed to sufficiently address animal antibiotics and have called for objectives to cut usage. . “We do know how much antibiotics are sold for food animals in total, but until we have information on which animals they are used in and for what reasons, it is difficult to come up with realistic and reasonable goals,” said Gail Hansen, a senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts’ antibiotic resistance project, which works to prevent overuse of antibiotics in food production. . A key component of USDA’s plan, proposed in a report last year, will be comparing antibiotic usage before and after the implementation of U.S. guidelines for producers to voluntarily phase out antibiotic use as a growth enhancer in livestock.  . The comparison is important because environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council say producers and veterinarians may cite disease prevention as a reason to continue administering the same antibiotics after the guidelines take effect at the end of next year. . The USDA “continues to strengthen its efforts” against antibiotic resistance, a spokeswoman said.    . Some restaurants and meat producers are not waiting for more government action before moving away from antibiotics. McDonald’s Corp said U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections. |Mon Mar 30 11:12:08 +0000 2015||U.S. plans to dig deeper on antibiotics given to livestock |5.825005520152781e+17|http://reut.rs/1IeSPrS
Samantha Kareen Nair|(Reuters) - BioDelivery Sciences International Inc said its pain drug failed to meet the main goal of a late-stage study, sending the drugmaker’s shares down nearly 30 percent. . The company said its Clonidine topical gel was not effective against a placebo in treating painful diabetic neuropathy, a condition that damages nerves in the legs and feet. . “Based on the results of our previously announced positive interim analysis, this outcome was unexpected,” said Andrew Finn, BioDelivery’s executive vice president of product development. . Janney Montgomery Scott LLC’s Chiara Russo said the fall in share price was overdone as the company is developing another promising pain drug. . “The Clonidine gel for me was only a ‘buck’ worth of my fair value. The main drug for us is obviously going to be the pain product that was partnered with Endo,” Russo said. . Biodelivery, which is developing an opioid treatment with Endo International Plc, submitted an application with the U.S Food and Drug Administration in December to market the drug. . Russo said about 20-50 percent of the 26 million diabetic patients in the United States experienced neuropathy pain and estimated that the market for treatments like Clonidine gel could be worth over $100 million. . Roth Capital analysts said they expect that this setback could delay the Clonidine gel program by 1-1.5 years. . BioDelivery’s shares were trading at $10.09 on the Nasdaq on Monday morning. Up to Friday’s close, the stock had risen 73 percent in the past 12 months. |Mon Mar 30 11:12:08 +0000 2015||BioDelivery Sciences pain drug fails late: stage study |5.825005500775096e+17|http://reut.rs/1xOEeUa
|PARIS (Reuters) - French pharmaceutical company Sanofi has examined acquisitions opportunities but does not view deal-making as “indispensable” to its future, its chairman told French paper Les Echos in an interview. . “We looked at potential deals but found the asking prices to be too high for the businesses,” said Sanofi Chairman Serge Weinberg.  . “We have opted for a balanced a strategy of innovation and diversification that makes acquisitions not indispensable.” . The global pharmaceutical industry has been consolidating in recent years as companies seek to replace drugs that are losing patent protection and renew their pipeline with new products. . Through early March, M&A transactions targeting biotech and pharma companies reached $59.3 billion this year, a 94 percent increase over the same period a year ago and the highest volume for this stage in any year since 2009. |Mon Mar 30 06:14:55 +0000 2015||Sanofi chairman says acquisitions not 'indispensable' for future |5.824257525425848e+17|http://reut.rs/1xO0mhu
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Children’s liquid medicines should only be measured in metric units to avoid overdoses common with teaspoons and tablespoons, U.S. pediatricians say.  . Tens of thousands of kids wind up in emergency rooms after unintentional medicine overdoses each year, and the cause is often badly labeled containers or unclear directions, said Dr. Ian Paul, a pediatrician at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Children’s Hospital and lead author of new metric dosing guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).  . “Even though we know metric units are safer and more accurate, too many healthcare providers are still writing that prescription using spoon-based dosing,” said Paul. “Some parents use household spoons to administer it, which can lead to dangerous mistakes.”  . For example, he said, accidentally using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon would triple the dose.  . To avoid errors associated with common kitchen spoons, the guidelines urge that liquid medicines being taken by mouth should be dosed using milliliters (abbreviated as “mL”). . Also, prescriptions should include so-called leading zeros, such as 0.5 for a half mL dose, and exclude so-called trailing zeroes, such as 0.50, to reduce the potential for parents to misunderstand the dosing. . While the AAP has been pushing for more accurate dosing of children’s medicines since the 1970s, the new guidelines are the most extensive call for metric dosing to date and are intended to reach drug manufacturers, retailers, pharmacists, prescribers and caregivers.  . “For this to be effective, we need not just the parents and families to make the switch to metric, we need providers and pharmacists too,” said Paul. . Manufacturers should eliminate labeling, instructions and dosing devices that contain non-metric units, the guidelines suggest.  . Cups or syringes provided with medicines should be labeled in metric units, and not be much larger than the maximum dose. . Ideally, the drugs should be dispensed with syringes that have a flow meter because that’s the most accurate way to measure liquid, said Robert Poole, director of the pharmacy at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford.   . Parents can put the syringe in the side of the child’s mouth and release the medicine slowly. “It’s easier for the child to swallow and you know the dose you get into the child is accurate,” said Poole, who wasn’t an author of the guidelines. “Those little cups that come with the medicine should really only be used to pour out liquid that you then draw into an oral syringe.” . In addition, electronic health records should make it impossible for non-metric doses to be prescribed by clinicians or processed at pharmacies, the guidelines suggest. . To avoid overdoses and errors, weight and body temperatures should also be recorded in kilograms and degrees Celsius rather than in pounds and Fahrenheit, said Lois Parker, a pediatric pharmacist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. . “Weight is a source of medication errors because if the parent reports the weight in pounds and we base the dosing on kilograms that can lead to the wrong dose,” said Parker, who wasn’t involved in the AAP guidelines.  . Among prescription drugs, narcotics present the biggest overdose dangers, said Dr. Brian Smith, a pediatrician at Duke University who wasn’t involved in writing the AAP guidelines. Kids who are the sickest, who go home from the hospital with numerous medicines, are often the most vulnerable to errors as parents struggle to keep track of the dosing and timing for all of the drugs. . For over-the-counter drugs, Smith worries the most about acetaminophen (Tylenol), because overdoses can lead to liver failure. It’s also dangerous to give children a wide variety of nonprescription drugs at the same time, because they might accidentally get more than one medicine with the same ingredient, leading to unintended overdoses. . “Kids do get overdosed; it happens in the hospital with all of these safeguards in place and it happens at home,” said Smith. “Kids come to the emergency room with unintentional overdoses and they get sick and some kids die. Anything we do to reduce errors by making the dosing clearer will save lives.” . SOURCE: .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Schools should not be using random drug tests to catch or deter drug abusers, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises in an updated policy statement. . The Academy recommends against school-based “suspicionless” drug testing in the new issue of the journal Pediatrics. . Identifying kids who use drugs and entering them into treatment programs should be a top priority, but there is little evidence that random drug testing helps accomplish this, said Dr. Sharon Levy, director of the adolescent substance abuse program at Boston Children’s Hospital and lead author of the new policy statement. . “Evidence on either side is very limited,” Levy told Reuters Health by phone. . Scientifically, the best way to test the value of random drug tests would be to put some kids into a drug testing program and others not, in a single school, but practically, that is difficult to accomplish. Instead, researchers have compared schools with drug testing programs to similar schools without them - and found mixed results. . One study did find a short-term reduction in kids’ self-reported drug use at a school with random testing, but the kids were followed for a relatively short period and reductions in use applied only to the drugs included in the testing. This is a problem since most drug testing panels do not include alcohol, Levy said. . “It’s possible that you do get some prevention out of these programs, but on the other hand it seems very expensive, very invasive, and has pretty limited results,” she said. . Adolescent drug use is usually sporadic, so even a kid who does use illegal substances may easily pass a random annual test and then feel comfortable to use freely for the rest of the year, she said. . Drug tests can result in false positives, and even a true positive says nothing about frequency or quantity of drug use, according to Ken C. Winters of the psychiatry department at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis, who is not in the AAP. . Testing alone is not a vehicle for behavior change, Winters told Reuters Health by email. . The tests may also uncover traces of students’ prescription medications, which may be a violation of their privacy, Levy noted. . Drug testing does have a place as part of a treatment program for kids who’ve been diagnosed with substance use problems or disorders, Levy said, but it is not appropriate for general screening. . The statement should lead schools with a random drug testing policy to reconsider. It’s not clear, however, how common the practice is. . “Turns out that it’s incredibly difficult to find out how common it is, it’s a decision made by individual school boards and local towns and that’s not published information,” Levy said. . Confidential self-reported screening for drug use has actually been relatively successful, and is much less expensive to implement, she said. . When kids do test positive for drugs at school, they often face punishment, when the focus should be on evaluation and intervention, she noted. The AAP supports school involvement in preventing, identifying and intervening to reduce adolescent substance use. . “One of the big difficulties that forms the basis of much of my research is, what do we do with kids who have substance use disorders who need more than a primary care program but less than a rehabilitation program,” Levy said. “There’s not a lot in the middle.” . “We absolutely think that schools could have a really major role in the whole spectrum of care in substance use disorders,” Levy said.  .

Alphonso Toweh|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia called upon Ebola survivors on Sunday to extend a period of sexual abstinence or protected sex beyond an already advised three months following their recovery, amid fears the country’s latest case may have resulted from sexual transmission. . The West African nation suffered a setback in its efforts to end a year-long outbreak of the disease earlier this month when it recorded its first new case of Ebola in several weeks. . The patient, a 44-year-old woman, died on Friday. More than 10,300 people have succumbed to the disease across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three countries hardest hit by the worst Ebola epidemic on record. . Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah, who heads Liberia’s Ebola response, said there was evidence to suggest the woman may have contracted the disease through sexual contact.  . Research has shown traces of Ebola in semen of some survivors for at least 82 days after the onset of symptoms, meaning they could carry the disease long after they have recovered. . There is no conclusive scientific proof that these traces are infectious. But as a precaution, the World Health Organization (WHO) advises Ebola survivors to abstain from sex during a 90-day period following recovery or, failing that, to practise safe sex. . Nyenswah said survivors should follow the WHO guidance for at least three months and suggested they even go a step further until the modes of transmission are better understood. . “Ebola survivors should consider correct and consistent use of condoms for all sexual acts beyond three months until more information is available,” he said. . Liberian health officials were monitoring 211 individuals known to have come into contact with the deceased woman but Nyenswah said that none had so far presented symptoms of the disease. . Liberia has largely succeeded in getting its Ebola outbreak under control and was on its way to completing the 42 days without a new case necessary to declaring the country free of the disease when it recorded the most recent infection.  . Its neighbors, however, have faced more difficulties in containing their own outbreaks.  . Sierra Leone, the worst affected of the three countries, wrapped up a three-day national lockdown aimed at accelerating the end of its Ebola epidemic on Sunday evening. . “Thank God it’s all over. It felt like prison. Let’s see how it ends Ebola,” Kadiatu Massaquoi, a resident of Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown, told Reuters. “I am looking forward to normal life again.”  . Guinea’s President Alpha Conde announced on Saturday new emergency measures enabling authorities to restrict movements in western Guinea, where Ebola transmission continues a year after the epidemic was declared. |Sun Mar 29 16:46:38 +0000 2015||Liberia calls for sexual abstinence to cut Ebola transmission risk |5.822223428830577e+17|http://reut.rs/1IaqvHh
Ian Simpson|GAITHERSBURG, Md. (Reuters) - Paramedic Dean Elliott rummaged through the ambulance’s emergency kit and pulled out a pint-sized red power drill, a tool whose use was honed on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. . The drill allows high-speed insertion of a needle directly into a bone’s marrow to give a patient intravenous fluids when life-saving seconds count, said Elliott, a lieutenant with the Montgomery County, Maryland, Fire and Rescue Service. . “The needle sits on there and you basically drill it right into the bone. It’s much easier and quicker,” Elliott, who is also a 30-year Navy corpsman, said as he demonstrated in the back of the ambulance. . The needle drill is among a raft of products and techniques  learned on battlegrounds in Iraq and Afghanistan that have transformed how U.S. doctors and emergency personnel back home help trauma patients survive life-threatening injuries. . Modern tourniquets that can be applied with one hand and have attached turning devices are replacing the makeshift handkerchiefs and stick or belt of past decades. . Clamps, needle drills and wound gauze impregnated with blood-clotting agents have been developed commercially from the hard lessons learned from more than a decade of fighting,  trauma treatment experts say. . Improved transfusions and airway tubes, a focus on stopping blood loss, and training to coordinate and improve care from injury site to operating room have also been critical to the new approach in emergency medicine in U.S. streets and hospitals. . “All of this together has massively increased survivability and pretty much all of them have been brought into the civilian ambulance population,” said Dr. Howard Mell, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. . Many U.S. agencies have adopted the military’s Tactic Combat Casualty Care protocol, while a bill moving through Congress would allow more former military medics to move into civilian emergency jobs by streamlining requirements for veterans who already have extensive training. There are no numbers readily available for how many veteran medics have already transferred their skills to civilian life. . About 35 million people are treated in the United States each year for traumatic injuries, such as those cause by gunshots and car accidents. Trauma is the leading cause of death for Americans under 44, according to the Trauma Center Association of America.  . The techniques brought home since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States are a reflection of the historic low in combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan. . Only about 10 percent of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan   were killed in action, with 90 percent wounded, according to Pentagon data. During World War Two, battle deaths made up 30 percent of U.S. casualties. . Before 9/11, the normal practice in U.S. emergency care was first to clear the airway, make sure the victim was breathing and then deal with bleeding. . But with the biggest number of wounded in the two recent conflicts coming from homemade bombs that blew off arms and legs, the emphasis switched to stopping bleeding. . “What difference does it make if we’re oxygenating the patient if the blood is squirting out on the ground?” said Caleb Causey, a former Army combat medic and owner of Lone Star Medics, a training company in Arlington, Texas. . The Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, which killed three people and wounded 264, became a grisly showcase for the stop-the-bleeding protocol. . Tourniquets, sometimes improvised, stanched heavy bleeding from wounds to victims’ feet and lower legs caused when the nail-filled pressure-cooker bombs exploded at ground level. All of the victims who made it to a hospital survived. . “From two wars on two fronts over a dozen years, we’ve learned a lot of what’s worked and what’s not worked,” said Causey. |Sun Mar 29 15:03:14 +0000 2015||Battlefield lessons transform U.S. emergency care |5.821963240088699e+17|http://reut.rs/1xLoGR0
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - With painstaking effort, a group of Chicago hospitals has managed to cut by half the number of infections caused by an especially deadly type of superbug. Now U.S. health officials want that kind of campaign to go national. . The White House on Friday told the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slash rates of infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria by 2020 as part of a plan to prevent patient deaths and curb overuse of antibiotics administered to humans and animals. . The CDC is pointing to the success of the Chicago Prevention Epicenter, one of five such CDC-funded programs nationally that coordinate research between local scientists and public health officials. The Chicago study focused on four long-term acute care hospitals, which tend to have above average rates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, called a “nightmare bacteria” because even the strongest antibiotics fail to subdue it. . “When it comes to antimicrobial resistance, for many of the threats that we face, we know what to do,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told Reuters in an interview. “We just need to get it done.”     . The program involved testing all patients for CRE infections at the time of admission and again two weeks later. Patients who developed CRE were isolated in a private room or in a ward with other CRE-infected patients. Healthcare workers wore protective gowns while tending to them, using some of the procedures used when caring for patients with Ebola. All infected patients were bathed in chlorhexidine gluconate, an antiseptic commonly used in hospitals. . At the end of three years, cases of CRE infections fell by half, Dr. Michael Lin, an infectious disease expert at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, told Reuters. . Lin said the exact protocol might not be suitable for the average U.S. hospital, but shows how a focused strategy can help the CDC reach its goals. . The World Health Organization has declared antibiotic resistance a global emergency. In the United States, it causes 2 million serious infections and 23,000 deaths each year, according to CDC estimates that some health experts consider conservative.  . Many of these infections occur in hospitals. CDC estimates that at any given time, one in 20 hospital patients has an infection resulting from medical treatment.  . The agency plans to work with hospitals and health departments across the country to develop surveillance programs to monitor and reduce infections and to promote “antibiotic stewardship” programs to stem over-prescription of antibiotics. . While the CDC has no regulatory authority, the government’s Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs require all participating hospitals to develop a stewardship strategy within three years. Failure to do so would disqualify them from the health plans.   . In January, President Barack Obama’s administration proposed doubling the government’s spending on tackling antibiotic resistance to $1.2 billion.  Obama said on Friday that the new superbug plan “spells out exactly where the money would go.”  . The president’s plan for the CDC calls for a 60 percent reduction in CRE infections by the end of this decade and halving infections caused by clostridium difficile, a deadly diarrheal bug, as well as life threatening bloodstream infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. . The agency also wants to address the over prescribing and overuse of antibiotics, which allow microbes to develop resistance to drugs, in a more organized way.  . Many states, however, do not collect data on drug-resistant infections. A 2013 poll by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials found that just half of 34 states that responded collected surveillance data related to antimicrobial resistance. Only 12 percent received state funding to do so. As part of his budget request for 2016, Frieden wants to support surveillance programs in each state.  . CDC also wants to encourage more hospitals and health systems to feed data on antibiotic prescription patterns to its  national database. . The CDC collects data from 5,000 U.S. hospitals on drug-resistant infections, but only 70 use a program that feeds their data on prescriptions to the agency, said Dan Pollock, chief of the CDC’s surveillance branch. The agency wants to help more hospitals connect with the national database. . “We’ve got a long way to go,” Pollock said. . More than half of all hospitalized patients will get an antibiotic at some point during their stay, but studies have shown that 30 to 50 percent of antibiotics prescribed in hospitals are unnecessary or incorrect, contributing to antibiotic resistance. . Recognizing that much of the misuse of antibiotics occurs outside of hospitals, the White House plan gives doctors who take part in Medicare or Medicaid three years to start reporting their antibiotics prescriptions, with financial incentives and penalties attached.  . Turning that tide can take significant resources and meet with resistance from doctors, experts said. . “It’s not a simple thing to do,” said Dr. B. Joseph Guglielmo, dean of the school of pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco. Patients often see antibiotics as an essential part of their treatment and doctors weigh that against potential harm they may cause in the future. . California already requires hospitals to have programs that typically include continuous review of what antibiotics each patient is receiving and designate experts consulting with the primary care team about whether they can be discontinued.   . Making such programs part of national health insurance requirements will encourage others to follow, said Dr. Kavita Trivedi of Stanford University School of Medicine and a spokeswoman for the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. . “You can be sure that if (Medicare) requires it, hospitals will find a way to fund antibiotic stewardship programs, just as those in California did.” |Sun Mar 29 12:25:34 +0000 2015||Battling nightmare infections: US CDC's plan to beat supberbugs |5.821566451045171e+17|http://reut.rs/1I9oQ4J
Josephus Olu-Mammah|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas at an angry crowd fighting over food supplies in Sierra Leone on Saturday, while other residents defied a three-day national lockdown that the government hopes will accelerate the end of the Ebola epidemic. . Sierra Leone has reported nearly 12,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths since the worst Ebola epidemic in history was detected in neighboring Guinea a year ago. . New cases have fallen sharply since a peak of more than 500 a week in December but the government says the lockdown, its second, is necessary to identify the last cases and to buck a worrying trend towards complacency. . Officials have ordered the six million residents to stay indoors on pain of arrest as hundreds of health officials go door-to-door looking for hidden patients and educating residents about the hemorrhagic fever. . Residents in and around Freetown, one of the last Ebola hotspots, were told to stock up on food and water but on the second day of the campaign some said they had already run out. Officials are distributing supplies only in very poor areas. . In the Devil Hole neighborhood hundreds of people left their homes to gather at a food collection point. Some residents complained they had not received food and fighting broke out until police arrived to scatter the crowd, making several arrests. . “People are desperate for food because of how the distribution is going,” said resident Adam Dumbuya. “This has led to panic.” . Elsewhere in the dense slums of eastern and central Freetown, residents defied the lockdown rules and wandered out onto the streets in search of supplies. . “We have exhausted this morning all we could manage to stock up,” said 51-year-old Ibrahim Kanu, a father of six, as he struggled to get rice in the crowd at East Brook Street in Freetown. Soldiers put a cordon in place there to contain the swelling crowd where people stood packed together, despite the risks of Ebola transmission via bodily fluids such as blood and sweat. . At Kissy Road in the east of Freetown, mostly women and children wandered into the twisting streets with buckets and yellow jerry cans to replenish water supplies. One man wandered out to bathe in a sewer, a Reuters reporter said. . Some charities have criticized lockdowns as heavy-handed and counter-productive, pointing to riots in neighboring Liberia’s capital last August in which a teenaged boy was killed. . Sierra Leone’s authorities have made exemptions for locals to attend church services on Palm Sunday. . Other officials said the campaign was making progress. . “Households visited have been responsive to the messages and the distribution of soap has been well received,” said Red Cross emergency health coordinator John Fleming. |Sun Mar 29 11:24:59 +0000 2015||Police fire tear gas on crowd during Sierra Leone Ebola lockdown |5.821413958524641e+17|http://reut.rs/1I9bmGd
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has reached a deal with the British government to supply a new meningitis B vaccine, following a lengthy stand-off over price with the product’s previous owner Novartis. . Health minister Jeremy Hunt announced the deal on Sunday, which he said would make Britain the first country in the world to have a nationwide vaccination program for the potentially deadly childhood disease. . Government advisers said in 2014 that all children over two months old should be given the vaccine Bexsero, which was developed by Novartis. But talks stalled over price, leading to high-profile protests by campaigners demanding immediate access. . Britain’s GSK earlier this month completed a deal to acquire the vaccine from Swiss-based Novartis, following a complex three-part asset swap worth more than $20 billion. . “We had a stand-off really for the best part of a year with the company that used to own this vaccine but since GSK have come on board they have reduced the price and that means we can now go ahead this year with rolling out the meningitis B vaccine,” Hunt said. . Nikki Yates, general manager of GSK in Britain, said the drugmaker was “delighted” to have reached an agreement just three weeks after acquiring Bexsero. Although pricing details remain confidential, Yates said it offered fair value to the National Health Service and a reasonable return for GSK. . Bexsero is the only meningitis B vaccine licensed in Britain, although a rival product from Pfizer is waiting in the wings. . Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said meningitis B had been at the top of his charity’s agenda for decades and he welcomed a decision that would save both lives and money. . The long-term costs to the health service of a severe case of the disease can exceed 3 million pounds ($4.5 million), he said. . Meningitis B is the biggest single cause of meningitis in Britain and leads to death in 10 percent of all cases and to long-term after effects in a further 36 percent. The condition involves infection and inflammation of the lining of the brain. .

|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea’s President Alpha Conde announced on Saturday new emergency measures enabling authorities to restrict movements in western Guinea where Ebola transmission continues a year after the epidemic was declared. . More than 10,300 people have died from Ebola in West Africa and while cases are thought to have peaked, Guinea is struggling to stamp out the virus partly due to often violent resistance to officials working to end it. . Following a dip in new cases in January, they have spiked again since early March in and around the capital, prompting officials to announce a new phase of the epidemic in Guinea. . “I declare in the districts of Forecariah, Coyah, Dubreka, Boffa and Kindia a reinforcement of emergency measures for a period of 45 days,” Conde said on state television late on Saturday. . “Wherever the need may be, throughout this period, measures of restriction and confinement will be taken,” he said in what would be a first for the country since the outbreak began. . Food and medical supplies would be given to the affected communities, Conde added. He not specify where or when such restrictions would take effect. Neighboring Sierra Leone is currently implementing a nationwide lockdown as part of a drive to accelerate the end of the epidemic. . Reuters reported last week that three doctors in a Conakry hospital had been infected with the virus because of a lack of infection control in a sign that the lapses that fueled the outbreak a year ago are dogging the final stages of the fight. . Since then, a further six medical staff across three clinics in western Guinea have been infected, including two doctors, according to a report written by France’s coordination team which provides technical assistance to Guinea on Ebola. . “Indefensible instances of negligence are showing up at the heart of our health care system,” Conde said. Centers where medical staff had caught the virus will be closed, he added.  . President Conde, who faces re-election in October, has set a target to get to zero Ebola cases by mid-April. The bauxite and iron ore-rich country is expected to take a $2 billion hit from Ebola and is trying to lure back investors, especially in the under-exploited resources sector. |Sat Mar 28 23:33:34 +0000 2015||Guinea president announces new emergency measures in Ebola fight |5.81962365140394e+17|http://reut.rs/1xJATWx

|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Saturday confirmed the third infection of a virulent strain of avian flu in a commercial poultry flock in Minnesota, the nation’s top turkey-producing state. . A case of H5N2 flu was found in a flock of 39,000 turkeys in Stearns County, which is northwest of Minneapolis, according to a notice from USDA. State officials quarantined the infected farm, and birds there will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease.  . Recent infections of avian flu in states stretching from Arkansas to Oregon have prompted overseas buyers to limit imports of U.S. poultry from companies such as Tyson Foods Inc, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc. . The USDA is developing a vaccine to protect poultry from new strains of avian flu, including H5N2, but has no plans to distribute it yet. |Sat Mar 28 17:22:30 +0000 2015||Minnesota suffers third bird flu infection in commercial poultry |5.818689804298322e+17|http://reut.rs/1I4FceN
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In her final speech after six years as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Margaret Hamburg defended the agency’s drug approval standards against critics seeking weaker regulatory standards. . “The great leaps forward in evidence-based medicine of the last 50 years have come in large part as a result of the high standards for product approval that Congress put in place after a series of disasters involving unsafe and ineffective medical products,” said Hamburg, 59, said on Friday at a National Press Club lunch in Washington, D.C. . Her comments come amid a push by some lawmakers for faster approvals of experimental drugs. A provision in a draft House of Representatives bill known as 21st Century Cures, for example, would allow the FDA to approve drugs designated as “breakthrough therapies” based on preliminary clinical data. . Only after the products were on the market would companies be required to conduct the type of longer-term safety and efficacy studies typically required for a drug’s approval. . “Breakthrough therapy” designation is currently given when early data shows a product may confer substantial improvement over an existing therapy. The products are reviewed particularly quickly and companies receive more intensive FDA drug development guidance. . But they are not approved based on the preliminary data alone. Under the proposed bill they could be. Last year the FDA received 96 breakthrough therapy requests and granted 31.  . Hamburg noted that the FDA typically approves new drugs faster than any other developed nation. Last year it approved the most new drugs in 20 years. . She said she disagrees with critics who argue that FDA regulation is the principal hurdle to the development of innovative new treatments.  . “In the race for the newest treatment we must remember the point that innovation doesn’t matter if the product doesn’t work,” she said. . Under pressure, the FDA has proposed allowing pharmaceutical companies to distribute medical literature showing that a drug may work for a condition for which it has not been approved. It also has proposed allowing companies to distribute literature showing the risks may be lower than shown on a drug’s label. . Hamburg said that while the FDA supports “responsible” communication of scientific information it does not support an approach that undercuts the incentive for studies to be done. . “History has shown that patients have been harmed by physician reliance on preliminary or incomplete information regarding unproven uses,” she said.  |Sat Mar 28 00:49:24 +0000 2015||In swansong, FDA chief defends drug approval process |5.816190618696581e+17|http://reut.rs/1xHm9aw
|MONROVIA (Reuters) - A woman who was Liberia’s sole remaining known Ebola patient died on Friday at a treatment center in the capital, said Francis Ketteh, acting head of the country’s Ebola response team. . The case was Liberia’s first in weeks and it set back efforts to halt a virus that has killed more than 10,000 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Authorities say the woman may have contracted Ebola through sex with a survivor. . “We have been able to trace the people she came in contact with,” Ketteh said. “We call on everyone to follow the Ebola preventative measures.” . Health officials have warned the general population that even after areas are declared free of the disease, new cases are possible through sexual transmission. Liberia remains vulnerable to cases imported from Guinea and Sierra Leone. . Guinea has reported a rash of new cases of the disease, which had appeared to be on the wane. . Before the woman fell ill, the Liberian government had hoped to declare the country Ebola-free next month, 42 days after the last patient tested negative for a second time, which would mark double the length of the virus’s incubation period. |Fri Mar 27 22:43:18 +0000 2015||Liberia's sole remaining known Ebola patient dies |5.815873263437292e+17|http://reut.rs/1xGXXVV

Theopolis Waters|(Reuters) - The U.S. hog herd grew 7 percent during the December-February quarter versus the same period last year, a U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed on Friday, reflecting producer profitability and the less-severe pig virus, said analysts.  . Hog farmers willingly expanded their herds after vaccines and tighter biosecurity measures offset the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv) that wiped out an estimated 9 million pigs since May 2013, they said. . The USDA report showed the U.S. hog herd as of March 1 at 107.0 percent of the year-ago level, at 65.934 million head, the largest total for that period since 66.718 in 2008. . Analysts, on average, expected 65.676 million head, or 106.8 percent of the year-earlier herd.  . The U.S. breeding herd was 102.0 percent of the year-ago level, at 5.982 million head, compared with average trade expectations for 103.6 percent, or 6.062 million. . The March 1 supply of market-ready hogs for sale to packers was 108.0 percent of a year earlier at 59.953 million head. Analysts, on average, expected a 7.2 percent increase, or 59.650 million.  . USDA’s pigs per litter category, the most affected by the virus, was at 10.17 pigs during the winter period, or 107.0 percent of the 9.53 a year ago. The result topped the record for that period of 10.08 pigs in 2013. . “The report is short-term bearish and long-term bullish,” said University of Missouri economist Ron Plain. He cited the huge year-over-year jump in the market hog inventory result versus a smaller-than-expected breeding herd outcome. . The market hog result was likely a result of more pigs that survived PEDv than anticipated, he said. . Don Roose, an analyst with Iowa-based U.S. Commodities, said Friday’s government data sent a signal that the industry is in “full blown” expansion mode.  . But, he said, that growth slowed down based on the surprising 2 percent decline in the June-August farrowing figure. Farrowings refer to the number of sows that are expected to give birth. . Friday’s USDA survey suggest plentiful supplies through the summer, which could pressure nearby Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog futures on Monday, analysts said. Deferred hog contracts could gain based on easing production beginning in late summer 2015, they said.   . “The key to the report is how much of it is dialed in after CME hog futures’ dramatic selloff in recent weeks in anticipation of bearish data,” said Roose. |Fri Mar 27 21:22:21 +0000 2015||USDA hog report confirms active herd growth as pig virus ease |5.815669554480865e+17|http://reut.rs/1xGE9lB
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - - Wheelchair basketball and other adaptive sports could help disabled veterans boost their self-esteem and lead healthier lives, early research suggests. . “Adaptive” sports have been modified to accommodate people with disabilities. While the study doesn’t prove the benefits of adaptive sports for disabled veterans, the researchers say they found a strong association between this special form of recreation and happier and healthier individuals. . “A number of patients have told me even after going through rehabilitation and even after being able to accomplish activities of daily living . . . they never truly felt like themselves until they participated in adaptive sports,” said Justin Laferrier, the study’s lead author and a U.S. Army veteran. . The number of disabled U.S. veterans has more than doubled since 2001 to 5.5 million because of the many wounded service members from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the authors note.  . Laferrier, now at the University of Connecticut, formerly led amputee physical therapy at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and at the Center for the Intrepid at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. . He and his team write in American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation that wheelchair sports date back to shortly after World War II, when neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttmann organized the first games at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, England.   . Although many disabled people have benefited from adaptive sports and the moral support of comrades since then, hard evidence is needed, said Laferrier. . “If you ask 100 people in a room if they thought adaptive sports and recreation was beneficial both physically and psychologically, 100 would say ‘yes,’ but then if you ask for money, they’d say, ‘Well, we don’t have any real evidence behind that, so we can’t give you money,”‘ Laferrier said in a phone interview with Reuters Health. . To test the effect of adaptive sports, 220 disabled veterans were recruited in 2009 and 2010 from the National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, U.S. Olympic Committee Warrior Games and National Veterans Summer Sports Clinic. Activities included sled hockey, archery, swimming and wheelchair basketball.   . Researchers looked at participation in individual sports, team sports or a combination of the two.  They used various self-esteem and quality of life scales, noting physical and psychological health, social relationships and environment. . The veterans had spinal cord injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder and upper or lower limb amputations, but also chronic diseases like arthritis, digestive problems, heart trouble and diabetes.   . The more the veterans participated in the sports after they were injured, the significantly better their quality of life. . The more years they participated, the higher their self-esteem climbed, too. Those with more than 10 years of participation since their injury scored 27 on a self-esteem scale (with the highest rate being 30), compared to veterans with one to five years, who scored 23.   . Veterans who participated mainly in individual sports and recreation had much lower self-esteem scores at 22, whereas those who did team events or a combination of team and individual events scored higher at 25.  . Irene Davis of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School in Boston told Reuters Health by e-mail that the study “was very suggestive” of the benefits of sports/exercise for disabled veterans, although it was limited because it lacked a comparison group and focused only on athletes at athletic events. . “As many veterans had been very physically active prior to their injury, the loss due to their disability can be extremely difficult for them to deal with,” said Davis, who was not involved in the study.  “Engaging in sports and exercise can have a very significant impact on their self-esteem.” . Davis directs a research project for the Department of Defense on improving function and quality of life in soldiers who have lost limbs or had them mangled in blast injuries and has worked in spinal cord rehabilitation, seeing the benefits of wheel chair basketball for this population, . “They began to dress like athletes and they definitely carried themselves differently – with an air of confidence,” said Davis, who also directs the Spaulding National Running Center in Cambridge. . Laferrier said veterans can turn to several organizations for adaptive sports, including U.S. Paralympics, Disabled Sports USA and rehabilitation hospitals or U.S. Veterans Administration hospitals.   .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – - Vision loss was linked with suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, in a new study from South Korea.  . “People with visual impairment often suffer substantial psychosocial consequences,” the authors wrote in the British Journal of Ophthalmology. . “Ophthalmologists should embrace their responsibility to help reduce suicidality and prevent suicides in patients with low visual acuity by encouraging them to seek psychiatric care, especially in those patients who perceive severe stress because of their ocular disease,” the authors wrote. . The study, by Dr. Tyler Hyungtaek Rim of the Institute of Vision Research at the Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul and colleagues, included almost 30,000 adults who underwent eye exams between 2008-2012. Participants also answered questions about their mental health, including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and depression, as well as whether or not they had sought counseling.  . Overall, about 16 percent of participants reported suicidal thoughts during the previous year, and one percent had attempted suicide. Only four percent said a doctor had diagnosed them with depression, however, and only about two percent had received counseling for their mental health issues.  . In general, quality of life decreased as vision got worse.  In fact, the participants with the poorest vision – profound low vision or no light perception at all - were two times more likely to have had suicidal ideations and three times more likely to have attempted suicide, compared to participants with normal vision.  . Dr. Byron Lam, a researcher at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study, said the study is interesting and the increase in the suicide ideation within the Korean population related to vision is an important finding. . “What’s interesting about their paper is that they didn’t find a connection with depression and we know that vision and visual impairment and depression is very well documented,” Lam said. . Lam said that lack of a finding could be due to differences in the overall prevalence of depression in different ethnic or racial groups, or how depression is assessed. . “I actually thought that finding was a little bit unusual because typically most studies that have been done have found that visual impairment is quite strongly linked to depression,” he said. . Lam has previously compared vision loss to overall death rates, including unintentional deaths and suicide. . “What we do know is that visual impairment definitely increases your risk for mortality, so having poor vision itself already increases your risk for mortality,” Lam said, “Possibly because you can’t perform activities of daily living well and you can’t exercise as much, or maybe it’s harder for you to go to the doctor.” . Lam said the current study adds to the idea that visual impairment doesn’t end with not being able to see, and it actually has many ramifications on a person’s life. . “I think it speaks to the idea that doctors have to be aware, families need to be aware of these implications,” he said. .

|LONDON (Reuters) - A 25-year-old British military nurse who was the first person in the world to be treated for Ebola with the experimental drug MIL 77 was discharged from hospital on Friday, London’s Royal Free Hospital said. . Anna Cross contracted the deadly disease after going to Sierra Leone last month to help care for victims of the West African outbreak. . She was brought back to Britain and successfully treated at the Royal Free in north London, Britain’s main center for Ebola treatment. . “After careful consideration Corporal Cross said she would like to be given the experimental drug MIL 77,” the hospital said in a statement. “She is the first Ebola patient anywhere in the world to be given this drug.” . The Chinese-made MIL 77 is a close relative of another experimental medicine ZMapp - which British nurse William Pooley received when he was treated at the Royal Free for Ebola last year. . Over 10,000 people have died in the worst-affected countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in the past year. |Fri Mar 27 17:43:55 +0000 2015||British Ebola patient cured after experimental treatment |5.815119822238802e+17|http://reut.rs/1HYimFG
Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) - Thanks to a generous benefactor, young mothers doing laboratory research at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston can receive major grants to keep them from falling behind while they raise their children.  . Since 1993, the Claflin Distinguished Scholar Awards at MGH have helped junior female faculty with young children keep pace with their male peers, who don’t face the same challenges to research productivity that women do during their child-rearing years. . Every year, five women are awarded $100,000 Claflin grants - named for benefactor Jane D. Claflin - to fund a research assistant for two years. The women are expected to leverage the funds for larger grants to accelerate their advancement.  . Women entering science and medicine don’t advance as quickly as their male colleagues. Earlier this month, a 28-member panel published a seven-point plan in the journal Cell Stem Cell for achieving gender equity in so-called STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math); the plan calls for expansion of “extra-hands awards” like the Claflin. (See Reuters Health story of March 16, here: . ) . Close to three-quarters of Claflin winners have remained at MGH, including infectious disease specialist Elizabeth Hohmann, who was among the first winners. “It allowed me to get on my feet to keep things rolling while . . . feeding babies,” she said. “It’s so easy to say ‘oh screw it’ and just give up.” . For endocrinologist Elaine Yu, a 2014 winner, the award makes time with her sons, ages 2 and 5, less stressful. “Raising kids is not easy, and this is one of the most stressful times in a research career because you are trying to establish yourself,” Yu said.  . The University of Massachusetts Medical School also funds two to four researchers yearly, male or female, with $30,000 during a “finite period of increased family care responsibilities.” Now in its fifth year, the Faculty Scholar Award committee receives three times as many applicants as it can fund. . “We wish we had double or triple the amount of money,” said Luanne Thorndyke, the university’s vice provost for faculty affairs.  . University of Massachusetts neurologist Susanne Muehlschlengel won a grant in 2011 when she was expecting her second child. Without the grant, she would have shut down her research during maternity leave. But even with it, she recognized that her pace of progress still could not match that of peers when she prioritized family and patient care obligations first.  . “Having kids certainly slowed down my career,” Muehlschlengel said. “When I look at male colleagues I did my fellowship with, even those one or two years behind me, they are two years ahead of me.” . Because the Faculty Scholar Award recognizes caregiving responsibilities beyond those involving children, biochemist Sean Ryder received funding in 2013 when his father was hospitalized with leukemia for five months before he died. Ryder was also juggling responsibilities to his wife and two sons at home, near Worcester. His father received treatment in New Hampshire, where Ryder spent two days a week.   . “I would have spent time with him regardless,” Ryder said. “But research in my lab would have slipped.”  . The Working Group’s paper also cited a German foundation providing “extra hands” in the form of childcare, but American awardees say the approach is misguided.  . “You don’t want to replace time with your kids, you want to replace time doing non-essential work,” said Catherine Chu, a Claflin-winning neurologist.  . Sharon Dekel, a psychologist and mother of three, said her Claflin Award brought the intangible benefit of increased recognition from her colleagues. “The Claflin is how people can really perceive you,” Dekel said.  . While president of the American Association of Immunologists, Laurie Glimcher launched a similar award program at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “Reproductive years coincide with the critical years in your career,” Glimcher said, noting that among too many young mothers, laboratory science suffers.  . Now the dean of Weill Cornell Medical College, Glimcher recently announced ten new $50,000 grants for female faculty with young children, to be awarded this spring. . “I think it’s money very well spent,” Glimcher said. “We can’t afford to lose 50 percent of the population” – that is, women – “in science.”|Fri Mar 27 16:31:46 +0000 2015||Grants help level the playing field for young moms in science |5.814938243478323e+17|http://reut.rs/1HXC6Jy
|PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi plans to launch its new Toujeo insulin for diabetics in the United States on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter. . Toujeo was approved for use in the United States on Feb. 25 and was recommended for approval by European regulators two days later. Sanofi has previously said it planned the launch for the beginning of the second quarter. . Toujeo is expected to face fierce competition from early 2016 from Tresiba, an rival ultra-long-acting insulin developed by Denmark’s Novo Nordisk. . Novo Nordisk on Thursday said it would resubmit Tresiba to U.S. regulators based on interim analysis data from a clinical trial, bringing its biggest new drug hope closer to the world’s top market. . Tresiba was rebuffed by U.S. regulators two years ago. Eli Lilly is the other main U.S. insulin market player. |Fri Mar 27 15:46:45 +0000 2015||Sanofi to launch Toujeo diabetes drug in U.S. on Monday: source |5.814824966861783e+17|http://reut.rs/1xFrjnz
Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) – - Eyeliner applied on the inside of the lash line is very likely to move into the eye itself and cause symptoms, according to a small study that captured migrating makeup on video. . Eye doctors often see patients coming into clinics with eyeliner residue stuck to contact lenses or trapped in the coating over their eyes called the tear film, said Alison Ng, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo in Canada who led the study. . “We wanted to look at how differently eyeliner migrated into the tear film when applied in two different ways: inside the lash line and outside of the lash line,” Ng said in an email. . Ng and her colleagues recruited three female subjects from the School of Optometry and Vision Sciences at Cardiff University in Wales. The participants were between ages 26 and 30 and had no known eye conditions. . The volunteers were assigned to one of two groups, those applying eyeliner inside the lash line, close to the eye, and those applying eyeliner to the skin outside of the lash line, further from the eye. They returned the next day and received eyeliner in the opposite location. . The researchers took video of each participant’s eyes five to 10 minutes after applying makeup and counted how many particles of eyeliner moved into the eye. . They found that between 15 and 30 percent more particles moved into the eye when eyeliner was applied to the inside of the lash line. The makeup also moved more quickly into the eye when eyeliner was applied inside the lash line. . A second round of videotaping two hours after applying the makeup showed there was little to no eyeliner remaining in the tear film. . Ng’s team writes in Eye and Contact Lens that theirs is the first study to prove that particles from pencil eyeliner move into the eye. . The researchers caution that the results may not apply to everyone because the participants were all Caucasian. Ng noted that Asian people’s eyelid shapes in particular may differ from those of the test subjects, but said that it’s unclear whether this will affect the way eyeliner moves into the eye. . This pilot study used a glitter eyeliner pencil to more easily spot the particles, but Dr. Joseph Ciolino, a physician at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, said  the results can likely be applied to a range of different products.  . He mentioned that the same issues are probably true for mascara, as the dye from the makeup can build up in the tear duct and cause excess tearing. . Getting eyeliner in the tear film can be uncomfortable, particularly for people with sensitive eyes or dry eye syndrome. People with dry eyes may have fewer tears to dilute the makeup, Ng noted. . The study team writes that contact lens wearers also face issues. The waxes and pigments in makeup may bind to the contact lenses, reducing the quality of vision and potentially even causing blurred vision. . Ciolino, who was not involved in the study, added that the build-up of makeup on contact lenses can also irritate the eye. . He added that another potential issue with applying liner close to the eye arises “because the tip of the eyeliner can become seeded with bacteria, cosmetics have been implicated in eye infections.” . Ng advised that makeup wearers can reduce the risk of complications by keeping products away from the inner lid margin. Ciolino agreed, “eyeliner should be applied on the outside of the lashes along the eyelid.” .

Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) – - Mothers who are overweight before pregnancy and those who gain too much while pregnant are more likely to have obese seven-year-olds, researchers say. . Their study, conducted from 1998 to 2013, focused on African-American and Dominican mothers from low-income neighborhoods in New York City. . “Because there is limited evidence of the long-term effects of pregnancy weight gain on childhood health outcomes in low-income urban populations, we sought to evaluate how pregnancy weight gain was related to childhood body size and obesity,” said lead author Elizabeth Widen at the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia University. . Andrea Deierlein of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital noted in an email that there are “many risks associated with childhood obesity - obese children are more likely to be obese throughout adolescence and adulthood.” . Deierlein, who was not involved in the study, noted that in adulthood, the risks associated with obesity include type 2 diabetes, hypertension and sleep disturbances. . Past research has also shown that overweight mothers are more likely to give birth to larger than normal babies, and those babies are at high risk of growing up to be obese. . The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) advises normal-weight women to gain 25-35 pounds during pregnancy, while overweight women should gain 15-25 lbs and obese women should gain just 11-20 lbs. . Widen and her colleagues studied 727 women in the third trimester of pregnancy. The mothers reported their own pre-pregnancy weight, education, receipt of public assistance and ability to afford food during pregnancy. . The researchers also had data on the mothers’ final pregnancy weight. . Widen noted in an email that relying on mothers to report their own pre-pregnancy weight is a possible limitation, because they might not remember correctly.  . The families involved in the study returned for a follow-up when the children were seven years old. . At that point, 22 percent of children were obese - and children whose mothers had been more overweight before becoming pregnant were more likely to be overweight themselves. . Greater weight gain during pregnancy was also linked to a higher percentage of body fat in children, and the children of mothers with excessive weight gain were almost three times more likely to be obese at age seven than other children, the researchers reported in Maternal and Child Nutrition.  . So-called observational studies like this one can’t prove that mothers’ weight in pregnancy caused these effects in their children. The results only show a link - they don’t prove cause-and-effect.  . Still, the authors say, their study is the first to look for a link between pregnancy weight gain and kids’ outcomes in a low-income, multi-ethnic urban group. They say this group is important to study because it has an overall high risk of obesity. . Deierlein noted, however, that this study’s findings are similar to those of previous ones that examined a wide range of ethnic and sociodemographic populations.  . “Pregnant women and women planning pregnancy should talk to their health care provider about strategies to gain within the IOM guidelines,” Widen said. An interactive website hosted by IOM (bit.ly/1Gh4zta) offers tips and resources to help women avoid gaining too much weight while pregnant, Widen said.  .

|LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators have postponed a decision on whether to recommend approval of a closely watched Bristol-Myers Squibb drug that helps the immune system fight cancer, officials said on Friday. . Nivolumab, which is already approved in the United States under the brand name Opdivo for melanoma and lung cancer, was on the agenda at a monthly meeting of European Medicines Agency (EMA) experts, but no verdict was reached. . The committee is considering whether to recommend the antibody medicine for treating advanced melanoma in adults. . A Bristol-Myers spokeswoman said the delay was due to the fact that the drugmaker had submitted additional data over the course of the review period. She declined to give details. . Such delays are not uncommon when questions arise and officials feel they need more information to evaluate a medicine. Nivolumab, which is already being reviewed on an accelerated basis at the EMA, could be considered again either in April or at a later date, an agency spokeswoman said. . The EMA did hand down positive recommendations on a number of other products, including a nine-strain version of Merck’s cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil 9. . Bristol’s nivolumab belongs to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system. It is expected to be one of the most commercially successful new drugs to reach major markets this year. . It competes with Merck & Co’s Keytruda, which is also on the market in the United States but not in Europe.  . Although Keytruda is still be waiting for regulatory approval in Europe, some patients in Britain will soon receive it through a new early-access scheme, under which highly promising new drugs are made available ahead of formal licensing. |Fri Mar 27 13:09:18 +0000 2015||Europe postpones decision on Bristol immune system cancer drug |5.814428725091205e+17|http://reut.rs/1HVG2up
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc said its experimental eye drug failed the main goal in a mid-stage study as a combination therapy, wiping out two-thirds of the company’s market value on Friday. . The study tested the eye-drop solution, OHR-102, in combination with Roche Holding AG’s injectable eye drug Lucentis, in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. . Ohr’s drug failed the study’s main goal of reducing the average number of Lucentis injections per patient when used in combination with the Roche drug. . Wet AMD is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels under the retina and macula, a process known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that leads to a rapid deterioration in vision. . There are two forms of CNV, “classic” and “occult”. The more severe “classic” version affects about two-thirds of wet-AMD sufferers. . Although a combination of OHR-102 and Lucentis improved visual clarity in about 42 percent of classic CNV patients, compared with 28 percent in the Lucentis monotherapy group, less of a benefit was seen in the overall population, the company said. . “There’s no sugar coating it, the fact that the study didn’t reach statistical significance ... in the overall patient population ... is disappointing to say the least,” Cowen & Co analyst Tyler Van Buren said, cutting his price target on Ohr to $15 from $25. . Ohr now hopes to initiate a late-stage study in patients with classic CNV by the second half of 2015, delaying OHR-102’s development by about three to six months, the company said in a conference call. . Buren expects OHR-102 to hit the U.S. market in 2019, and estimates peak sales of $1 billion. . The news of OHR-102’s failure sent Ophthotech Corp’s stock up about 5 percent on Friday. Ophthotech’s eye injection, Fovista, is undergoing late-stage testing in combination with Lucentis for wet-AMD. . Both Ohr and Ophthotech’s drugs target a protein called platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which regulates cell growth and division. . OHR-102, however, is a solution that can be self-administered, while Fovista, like Lucentis and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s blockbuster drug Eylea, must be injected into the eye. . Shares of Ohr, which has two other drugs in development, were down about 64 percent at $3.06. |Fri Mar 27 11:41:27 +0000 2015||Ohr Pharma's eye drug fails main goal in mid-stage study |5.814207671010017e+17|http://reut.rs/1xEKApg
Umaru Fofana|FREETOWN (Reuters) - The capital of Sierra Leone was “eerily quiet” on Friday at the start of a three-day national lockdown aimed at accelerating the end of an Ebola epidemic in the worst affected country. . Hundreds of health volunteers fanned out across the capital on Friday — one of the last remaining hotspots — looking for hidden Ebola patients and raising awareness about the epidemic in the country’s second lockdown. . Sierra Leone has reported nearly 12,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths since the epidemic was declared a year ago. . New case numbers have tumbled from a peak of over 500 per week in December to 33 in the week to March 22, with most in the capital and near the northern border with Guinea, which is also still fighting the outbreak.  . Liberia has just one known case left and the three countries have set a target to get to zero cases by mid-April. . “What we want to achieve is to re-engage our communities, re-energize them, pump more oxygen into this fight because we have been doing it for the last 10 months so people are getting tired, and there is a bit of complacency,” the head of the National Ebola response center, Palo Conteh, told Reuters. . In an indication that residents were cooperating with the campaign, Red Cross emergency health coordinator John Fleming said the streets of the capital’s normally bustling Aberdeen fishing community were “eerily quiet” on Friday morning. . “There’s nobody in the street,” he said from a site overlooking the city’s slums. . Officials hailed a previous lockdown in September as a success, helping to identify more than 100 new cases, although some charities criticized the campaign as being heavy-handed.  . Riots broke out in a poor quarantined neighborhood of Liberia’s capital Monrovia and a teenaged boy was killed. Sierra Leone’s National Ebola Response Center has said that residents will be allowed out for Friday prayers and for Sunday church services. |Fri Mar 27 11:23:26 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone three-day Ebola lockdown leaves capital 'eerily quiet' |5.814162319006802e+17|http://reut.rs/1HUQPEY
|BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Friday cleared a German scheme that allowed exceptions to be made for pharmaceutical groups whose medicines were subject to price freezes. . Germany introduced price freezes in the form of rebates granted by the producers of certain prescription medicines but also allowed for exemptions if companies could prove that this would put an unacceptable financial burden on them. . The Commission, which acts as the competition watchdog in the 28-member European Union, said that after an investigation it found no evidence that such exemptions constituted state aid. |Fri Mar 27 11:23:26 +0000 2015||EU clears German scheme to exempt pharma groups from price freezes |5.814162300888105e+17|http://reut.rs/1xEI423
Ben Hirschler|(Reuters) - Denmark’s Novo Nordisk is to resubmit its new insulin Tresiba to U.S. regulators based on interim analysis data from a clinical trial, bringing its biggest new drug hope closer to the world’s top market. . Shares in the company leapt 13 percent to an all-time high in early trade in Copenhagen on Friday after it said it would file with the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) within the next month. The drug was rebuffed by the FDA two years ago. . The plan, announced late on Thursday, is a big relief to investors, since a decision not to use the early data on Tresiba and related drug Ryzodeg would have further delayed a U.S. launch. Tresiba is already available in Europe and other markets. . Novo, the world’s top insulin maker, is now in a position to get a U.S. approval for Tresiba as soon as October or November, putting it on track to launch by early 2016, according to industry analysts.  . Citigroup’s Peter Verdult said he believed the odds of U.S. approval were greater than 90 percent, given a small group of Novo staff sitting behind a communications “firewall” had already discussed the data with FDA. . The FDA asked Novo to conduct a dedicated cardiovascular risk trial, known as DEVOTE, after refusing to approve Tresiba in 2013 because of worries it might be linked to higher rates of heart attacks or strokes. . Novo had previously said it would decide during the first half of this year whether to submit interim or full trial results. Waiting for full results would have scuppered its hope of getting to market in 2016 and put it behind in a highly competitive sector. . Novo vies with Sanofi and Eli Lilly in supplying insulins to diabetics. A Tresiba launch in the United States within the next year may help see off rival products, notably Sanofi’s new insulin Toujeo, which is designed to succeed the French company’s Lantus. . Tresiba, an ultra-long-acting form of insulin that is also known as degludec, is currently forecast to generate annual sales of $2.2 billion by 2020, according to consensus estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.  . But that number could rise as confidence in the product’s prospects now increases. |Fri Mar 27 08:41:27 +0000 2015||Novo Nordisk surges on plan to resubmit rejected insulin in U.S. |5.813754681144566e+17|http://reut.rs/1HTO474
David Lawder|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate will wait more than two weeks before acting on a bill to permanently fix the flawed formula for reimbursing Medicare physicians, after an April 1 deadline to start a 21 percent cut in payment rates.  . Senate Republican and Democratic leaders said early on Friday that they would take the bill up when they return on April 13 from an Easter/Passover break. . The measure, a rare bipartisan achievement in a deeply divided Congress, was overwhelmingly approved on Thursday by the House of Representatives. . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he has been reassured that the delay would not cause doctors to see lower  Medicare payments due to the lag time in the normal processing of payments from the health care program for seniors.   . “They can handle a two week gap here,” McConnell said after a marathon session to pass a budget. “We’ll turn to it very quickly when we get back. I think there’s every reason to believe it’s going to pass the Senate by a very large majority.” . The measure drafted and driven forward by Republican House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would fix a long-standing problem with how Medicare pays doctors. . A 1997 budget-cutting bill reduced the payment rates based on a flawed formula linking doctor pay to economic growth, but Congress has routinely passed temporary fixes to forestall cuts that have proven costly. . The measure approved 392-37 by the House would create a new payment formula focused on the quality of care. To help pay for these higher rates, the bill would also impose higher premiums on wealthier Medicare beneficiaries. . However, the proposal would still add $141 billion to U.S. deficits over 10 years, according to congressional forecasters, sparking opposition from some fiscal conservatives. . While the measure has strong support in the Senate, the delay could give opponents time to sway senators against the plan. . One of the government’s largest social safety net programs, Medicare is health insurance that serves 54 million elderly and disabled people. . Under the plan, a Medicare recipient with annual income of between $133,000 and $160,000 would see their Medicare premium share increase from 50 to 65 percent, and a recipient with annual income between $160,000 and $214,000 would pay 75 percent rather than 65 percent. |Fri Mar 27 08:41:27 +0000 2015||Senate delays vote on Medicare payment fix for two weeks |5.813754663486464e+17|http://reut.rs/1xEjxuf
Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The White House is due to issue an ambitious plan to slow the growing and deadly problem of antibiotic resistance over the next five years, one that requires massive investments and policy changes from a broad array of U.S. government health agencies, according to a copy of the report reviewed by Reuters.  . The 60-page report is the first ever to tackle antibiotic resistance so broadly. It was compiled by a government task force led by the administration’s top officials for health, agriculture and defense.   . A White House official confirmed that it would release the plan on Friday.  . Doctors and health experts have warned for decades that rising rates of resistant bacteria are leading to tens of thousands of deaths, threatening to nullify modern medical advancements. . The goals include drastically reducing the rates of the most deadly “superbug” infections within five years, investing in new diagnostic tools and antibiotic drugs, and improving antibiotic use. Other tactics include surveillance and prescribing practices in livestock and hospitals and increasing international collaboration through foreign ministries of health and the World Health Organization.  . A broad-based approach is necessary, experts said, because overuse of antibiotics from hospitals to U.S. farms has created a problem that has quickly grown out of control. In January, the Obama administration proposed doubling the government’s investment in antibiotic resistance to $1.2 billion.  . “We’ve never seen something this sweeping and comprehensive,” Amanda Jezek, vice president for public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in an interview with Reuters. IDSA has testified before Congress for years to pass laws and increase funding for antibiotic resistance, she added. . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 2 million people are infected with resistant bacteria each year and 23,000 die, which experts say is a conservative estimate. . Under the plan, the CDC will aim to reduce rates of the most deadly and widespread infections. That includes cutting Clostridium difficile infections by 50 percent, reducing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections by 60 percent and lowering Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections by at least 50 percent.   . Hospitals will be required to implement programs to increase infection controls, such as judiciously washing hands, hospital surfaces and equipment, and reducing the use of antibiotics in patients.  . Doctors working with the government’s Medicare and Medicaid health plans will be required to report their prescribing patterns for antibiotics, particularly when used to treat non-bacterial infections, such as common colds. . The plan calls for CDC to increase its screening of people arriving from countries with high rates of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. The CDC currently screens 500,000 such arrivals per year, and the plan calls for doubling that within five years. . Up to 70 percent of antibiotics sold in the United States are given to livestock and poultry, said Sujatha Jahagirdar, program director at consumer group U.S. PIRG Stop Antibiotics Overuse.  . Jahagirdar noted that the report’s recommendations fall short of policies adopted by companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which seeks to buy completely antibiotic-free meats. McDonald’s Corp recently announced plans to phase out purchases of chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections. . The plan recommends that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture take further steps to curtail the use of medically important classes of antibiotics for growth promotion in animals raised for human consumption. It did not set a specific goal or say how the agencies will be held accountable.  . “President Obama gets an A for tackling this problem from multiple angles,” said Jahagirdar. “But in terms of addressing the biggest problem, the troubling overuse and misuse of antibiotics on large factory farms, the administration gets an incomplete.” . The government hopes to help put two new antibiotic drugs on the shelves and fund development of a diagnostic tool that would quickly tell doctors whether patients have a bacterial or viral infection, which would improve prescribing.  . Because few new antibiotics have been developed in the past decade, hospitals have increasingly been forced to use colistin, a toxic antibiotic approved for use in the 1950s, as a drug of last resort.  . “This kicks everything up to another level,” said Jezek of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, “which, given the severity of the threat, is absolutely necessary.”  |Fri Mar 27 00:16:57 +0000 2015||White House crafts first-ever plan to fight superbugs |5.812485069266289e+17|http://reut.rs/1xDcoKp

Under the plan, the CDC will aim to reduce rates of the most deadly and widespread infections. That includes cutting Clostridium difficile infections by 50 percent, reducing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections by 60 percent and lowering Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections by at least 50 percent.   . Hospitals will be required to implement programs to increase infection controls, such as judiciously washing hands, hospital surfaces and equipment, and reducing the use of antibiotics in patients.  . Doctors working with the government’s Medicare and Medicaid health plans will be required to report their prescribing patterns for antibiotics, particularly when used to treat non-bacterial infections, such as common colds. . The plan calls for CDC to increase its screening of people arriving from countries with high rates of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. The CDC currently screens 500,000 such arrivals per year, and the plan calls for doubling that within five years. . Up to 70 percent of antibiotics sold in the United States are given to livestock and poultry, said Sujatha Jahagirdar, program director at consumer group U.S. PIRG Stop Antibiotics Overuse.  . Jahagirdar noted that the report’s recommendations fall short of policies adopted by companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which seeks to buy completely antibiotic-free meats. McDonald’s Corp recently announced plans to phase out purchases of chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections. . The plan recommends that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture take further steps to curtail the use of medically important classes of antibiotics for growth promotion in animals raised for human consumption. It did not set a specific goal or say how the agencies will be held accountable.  . “President Obama gets an A for tackling this problem from multiple angles,” said Jahagirdar. “But in terms of addressing the biggest problem, the troubling overuse and misuse of antibiotics on large factory farms, the administration gets an incomplete.” . The government hopes to help put two new antibiotic drugs on the shelves and fund development of a diagnostic tool that would quickly tell doctors whether patients have a bacterial or viral infection, which would improve prescribing.  . Because few new antibiotics have been developed in the past decade, hospitals have increasingly been forced to use colistin, a toxic antibiotic approved for use in the 1950s, as a drug of last resort.  . “This kicks everything up to another level,” said Jezek of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, “which, given the severity of the threat, is absolutely necessary.”  |Thu Mar 26 22:17:44 +0000 2015||White House crafts first-ever plan to fight superbugs |5.812185027422904e+17|http://reut.rs/1xCUU0O
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two experimental Ebola vaccines, one from GlaxoSmithKline PLC and the other from biotech start-up NewLink Genetics Corp, “appear to be safe” part way through a clinical trial being conducted in Liberia, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Thursday. . The two vaccines, each given in a single injection, are being tested for safety and efficacy on more than 600 people in Liberia in a mid-stage clinical trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a branch of NIH. . The Ebola epidemic that began in West Africa one year ago has killed more than 10,200 people, but a decline in new cases in the most affected countries, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, has led to hopes that it may be ending. . Based on the encouraging safety results, the study may now advance to the next phase of efficacy testing, in which additional volunteers are injected with the GSK vaccine, the NewLink vaccine, or a dummy shot and assessed to see whether their immune system responds by producing anti-Ebola antibodies. . No volunteers are intentionally exposed to the often-deadly virus. Instead, the immune response is considered an acceptable proxy for how effective the vaccine would be if someone were exposed. . “We are grateful to the Liberian people who volunteered for this important clinical trial and encouraged by the study results,” NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a statement. “Now we must move forward to adapt and expand the study so that ultimately we can determine whether these experimental vaccines can protect against Ebola virus disease and therefore be used in future Ebola outbreaks.” . The trial of the GSK vaccine, which was developed with NIAID scientists, and the NewLink vaccine, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink, began on Feb. 2 in Monrovia, Liberia. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers know who received which vaccine or the saline injection. . The researchers will continue to enroll volunteers in the trial through late April, aiming for about 1,500 people. They especially want to enroll more women, who made up only 16 percent of the first group, to be sure there are no gender-based differences in immune response or side effects. . The volunteers will be followed for at least a year, with blood samples tested six and 12 months after vaccination to determine how long the immune response lasts. |Thu Mar 26 22:04:11 +0000 2015||Two experimental Ebola vaccines pass safety test in African trial |5.812150933728788e+17|http://reut.rs/1HQhTW9
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – - A new Swiss study says that widows and widowers still mourn their spouses as much as ever, but compared to 35 years ago, everyday life is easier, especially for women. . Widows, at least in Switzerland, have fewer financial troubles and more social connections than their counterparts in 1979, but widowers still complain of loneliness, researchers found. . The authors wanted to see if the negative effects of widowhood on psychological and physical health had changed over time. . “Public knowledge about spousal loss in old age has in general a negative connotation — bereavement is usually seen as an individual issue,” Pasqualina Perrig-Chiello told Reuters Health by email. . “However bereaved individuals vary considerably in their reactions to loss, and little is known on how the historical context contributes to adaptation to spousal loss,” said Perrig-Chiello of the University of Bern who led the study. . Past research has shown that men and women react differently to the loss of a spouse. Widowers tend to be vulnerable to loneliness, whereas widows tend to be more distressed by economic issues, especially if their husband took care of family finances. . For their study, published in The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Perrig-Chiello and colleagues examined health and depression information from two separate Swiss studies involving adults aged 65 years and older, most of them women.  . The studies took place in 1979 and 2011 and included a total of 753 widows and widowers, as well as 1,517 married people to act as a comparison group. . In both studies, the participants were asked to rate their own physical and mental health and to describe any difficulties related to the loss of a spouse, such as losing a sense of purpose in life, needing to do everything alone, feelings of loneliness and dealing with social and financial problems.  . The researchers found that subjective reports of health improved over time for both married and widowed participants but widowed people fared worse than marrieds in both time periods.  . Widowed people in 2011, especially women, reported fewer social and financial difficulties than their counterparts in 1979, however. Rates of depression among widows did not differ over time. . “Men reported more complaints about loneliness than women at both time points, whereas widows in 2011 reported significantly less loneliness than their counterparts in 1979,” Perrig-Chiello said. . She thinks that women seem to take greater advantage of new and enhanced social service programs that began in Switzerland between the two time points.  . These programs provide educational, recreational and psychological services for older people, she said.  . Perrig-Chiello said most bereaved people adapt well to the new situation, “however the adaptation to the new situation needs time for finding a new daily routine, but also a personal, deliberate effort for defining a new identity, investment for keeping or redefining social contacts.” . She added that family members, friends and also social groups can help provide support. . Perrig-Chiello noted that only a minority of widows and widowers exhibit chronic or complicated grief and require professional help from psychologists, psychiatrists or pastoral counselors.  . “But also the help of a social worker in case of precarious financial situations can be a help, since - as our results show - sufficient financial resources may help to relieve secondary stressors,” she said. . Karen Holden said she thinks that today there’s much more support for women, socially and in the form of information, which helps in times of financial stress. . “I think with the increase in divorce, singlehood through marital dissolution is more common, so you get much more information – so there’s also much more information for widows,” Holden told Reuters Health.  . “Also, marriages are much more shared financially, so you don’t get the disorientation of suddenly having to manage on your own,” said Holden, who studies poverty and aging at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and was not involved in the study. . She added that today men are much less likely to shield their wealth from their wives compared to the past.  . Holden said the study findings may show that we’re managing financial distress better now, not only after widowhood but also during the process of the husbands’ death so that women are less stressed when they actually are widowed. .

Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked for a drastic cutback of an ambitious health care plan after cost estimates came in at $18.5 billion over five years, several government sources said, delaying a promise made in his election manifesto. . Modi has had to make difficult choices to boost economic growth - his government’s first full annual budget, announced last month, ramped up infrastructure spending, leaving less federal funding immediately available for social sectors. . The health ministry developed a draft policy on universal health care in coordination with the prime minister’s office last year. The National Health Assurance Mission aims to provide free drugs, diagnostic services and insurance for serious ailments for India’s 1.2 billion people. . The health ministry proposed rolling out the system from April 2015, and in October projected its cost as $25.5 billion over four years. By the time the project was presented to Modi in January the costs had been pared to 1.16 trillion rupees ($18.5 billion) over five years. . That was still too much. The program was not approved, three health ministry officials and two other government sources told Reuters. Three officials said the health ministry has been asked to revamp the policy, but work is yet to start.  . “The constraint on India’s financial resources was conveyed to health officials, and even to those from other ministries,” said one government official who is not from the health ministry but attended the meeting where Modi was present. . The meeting was held in January and the discussions were not made public. All of the sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the discussions. . Officials at the prime minister’s office and the finance ministry, as well as the health ministry, did not respond to requests seeking comment. . Modi’s manifesto ahead of the election that brought him to power last year accorded “high priority” to the health sector and promised a universal health assurance plan. The manifesto said previous public health schemes, that have been mired in payment delays recently, had failed to meet the growing medical needs of public. . Modi has another four years left in his first term to fulfill the promise. . India currently spends about 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on public health, but the badly-managed public health system means funds are not fully utilized. A health ministry vision document in December proposed raising spending to 2.5 percent of GDP but did not specify a time period. . So health experts were dismayed when the federal budget for the full-year starting April raised the allocation for the country’s main health department only by about 2 percent from the previous year, less than inflation. The meager increase dimmed prospects for the massive health plan, they said. . “How can it happen when you have truncated resources?” one health ministry official asked. . The health plan was drafted in consultation with Modi’s office and an expert panel, including an expert from the World Bank. The proposal included insurance to cover more expensive and serious ailments such as heart surgeries or organ failure.     . Two government officials said this benefit will be withdrawn. The health ministry was also asked why the new plan could not be simply combined with existing health schemes. . The decision to slash the level of insurance coverage will have an impact on India’s thriving private health sector, which would have seen huge business growth as the program channeled millions of new patients into private hospitals. . Currently only 17 percent of India’s population has some form of health insurance. . Anjan Bose of NATHEALTH, a group that represents such private firms, said the delays in the program would disappoint both the industry and the public. . “Greater availability of funds for public health care under this program would have further boosted growth of the private medical industry,” Bose said. |Thu Mar 26 21:32:51 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Modi government puts brakes on India's universal health plan |5.81207207867519e+17|http://reut.rs/1HQ4Kw5
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Men who work with hormone-mimicking chemicals for at least 30 years have a higher risk of cancers of the lymph tissue than others, according to a long-term observational study in several European countries. . “Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with our endocrine system (hormones),” said lead author Laura Costas of the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Barcelona. Some endocrine disruptors either activate or block hormone receptors, while others can modify the production or delivery of natural hormones, she said.  . “The hormone system has a delicate equilibrium and chemicals altering it may produce health problems,” Costas told Reuters Health by email. . For the new study, the authors used interviews of 2,178 people diagnosed with a lymphoma and of 2,457 similar people without the cancer between 1998 and 2004 in Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland and the Czech Republic. Participants listed all of their full-time jobs that had lasted for at least one year. . Experts determined which of the occupations would likely have involved exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, which include pesticides, cosmetics, plastic additives and flame-retardants. . Many of the chemicals are common in everyday life, so the experts estimated which jobs would likely have led to more exposure than just the “background” level that most people experience. . “The exposure to these compounds is common in specific jobs,” Costas said. “We observed that around 15 percent of participants without cancer worked for 30 years or more in these occupations.” . “However, we did not have data on the protections that people used to avoid contact with these chemicals, which is relevant to assess their personal exposure,” she said. . Among 1,720 people with cancer, 633 had probable exposure to the chemicals, 438 had possible exposure and 588 were unlikely to have been exposed.  . There was no overall association between ever having been exposed to one of the chemicals and lymphoma risk. But as exposure duration increased, risk for lymphoma increased as well. . Men who had been exposed to a hormone-disrupting chemical for more than 30 years were 32 percent more likely to develop lymphoma than those with no exposure. There was no increased risk for women, according to the results in the British Journal of Cancer. . “These are associations that merit more research in order to be confirmed in other basic and translational studies before concluding that they cause lymphoma,” Costas said.  . This study supports correlation, but not necessarily causation, between exposure and lymphoma, according to Andrea C Gore, the Johnson and Johnson Centennial Professor of Pharmacy at The University of Texas at Austin, who was not part of the new research.  . “Cause-and-effect between endocrine disruptors and human disease is always very difficult to establish as there are many other reasons why someone develops a disorder, and we all have unique genetic risk factors, differences in lifestyle, and other characteristics that contribute to ultimately developing a disease,” Gore told Reuters Health by email. . The effect size in the new study was relatively small, she said. . Only finding an association for men may explain why lymphomas are more common for men than women, Costas said, but endocrine-disrupting chemicals may have other impacts on women’s health. . “Occupation is only one source of exposure, but there are others, and the most common is diet,” Costas said.  . The dietary impact of these compounds is still unclear, she said. . “Our results refer to exposures that happened many years ago, and luckily, work conditions and security have substantially improved over the years,” she said. “Measures of protection have been implemented, and it is important that all workers follow the guidelines to minimize exposure to these chemicals.” .

| (The online version of this March 24th story has been refiled to fix a slug issue) . (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would hold a public hearing seeking information and comment on the use of products labeled ‘homeopathic’, as well as the agency’s regulatory framework for such products. . The hearing, scheduled for April 20-21, will discuss prescription drugs, biological products, and over-the-counter drugs labeled homeopathic, a market that has expanded to become a multimillion dollar industry in the United States. . The agency is set to evaluate its regulatory framework for homeopathic products after a quarter century. (. ) . An Australian government study released this month concluded that homeopathy does not work. (. ) . The FDA issued a warning earlier this month asking consumers not to rely on asthma products labeled homeopathic that are sold over the counter. (. ). . Homeopathic medicines include pellets placed under the tongue, tablets, liquids, ointments, sprays and creams. . The basic principles of homeopathy, formulated by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century, are based on a theory that a disease can be treated using small doses of natural substances that in a healthy person would produce symptoms of the disease. . The agenda for the hearing will be posted soon, the FDA said on Tuesday.  |Thu Mar 26 19:51:40 +0000 2015||FDA to evaluate homeopathy regulatory framework |5.811817452419359e+17|http://reut.rs/1HPmp7i
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Olympus Corp, the largest maker of a medical device at the center of recent U.S. superbug outbreaks, issued new cleaning instructions for its equipment on Thursday, urging health providers to adopt them “as soon as possible.” . Olympus said in a 13-page letter that a small-bristle brush required for the new procedures to clean potentially deadly bacteria from the devices would be shipped “no later than May 8.” . Olympus did not directly address whether the devices, called duodenoscopes, are safe to use until then and whether patients should postpone procedures until hospitals have received the brush. Until then, the company recommended cleaning the duodenoscope in accordance with the old instructions. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend that patients forego procedures until the brushes are shipped out, but had previously advised discussing the benefits and risks of using duodenoscopes with their physician. . Duodenoscopes are flexible, lighted tubes inserted down the throat in a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). More than 500,000 ERCPs using duodenoscopes are performed in the U.S. annually, usually to drain fluids from pancreatic and biliary ducts blocked by cancerous tumors, gallstones, or other conditions.   . Because the devices are reusable, they are supposed to be thoroughly cleaned after each use so pathogens are not transferred from one patient to the next. . Seven patients at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, including two who died, were exposed from October through January to antibiotic-resistant bacteria apparently spread by improperly disinfected Olympus duodenoscopes. Federal regulators determined that microbes could spread even when the manufacturer instructions were followed. . The problem was the design of the instruments, regulators determined, in particular a movable part called the elevator that FDA described as “extremely difficult to access.”  . In its letter, Olympus recommends raising and lowering the elevator mechanism three times while the device is immersed in a disinfectant. . In addition, an area around the elevator must be cleaned with two different-sized brushes: one that hospitals already use and one that Olympus will ship by May 8. . The FDA has signed off on Olympus’ instructions, issuing them in its own safety communication on Thursday “so that facilities can adopt the new high level disinfection steps immediately and begin training” personnel. |Thu Mar 26 19:06:39 +0000 2015||Olympus issues 'urgent' steps for cleaning device linked to superbugs |5.811704174502502e+17|http://reut.rs/1HP4OMK
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - - Plain cigarette packages adorned with graphic health warnings may make smokers more likely to consider quitting, an Australian study finds.  . In an effort to make smoking less appealing, starting in late 2012 Australia required that cigarettes be sold in boxes emblazoned with harsh words and bold color photos illustrating the health risks. One box says “smoking kills” above a close-up image of a toe-tagged foot in the morgue; another says “smoking causes blindness” and displays a photo of an eyeball in a shriveled socket.  . “The health warnings were new and larger than before, but also for the first time they appeared on the required plain drab brown packs so they stood out more and looked more serious,” said senior study author Melanie Wakefield. . “Thinking the health warnings were credible and trying to avoid the warnings predicted more thoughts about quitting and quit attempts,” Wakefield, of the Cancer Council Victoria in Melbourne, said in an email. . Wakefield and colleagues surveyed smokers before and after the new packages debuted to see how the design changes influenced thoughts about quitting.  . After doing an initial phone survey of more than 10,000 people between April 2012 and March 2014, the researchers followed up with about 5,000 smokers to see how they felt about the packages after one month of use.  . Study participants were 18 to 69 years old. They were identified as smokers if they used cigarettes daily or weekly. People who indulged less often could identify themselves as smokers or nonsmokers.  . The researchers split the smokers into four groups based on the timing of the followup survey: a couple of months before the new boxes debuted; just as the packages came out; later in the introductory period; and after the redesign was fully implemented.  . Smokers surveyed later in the introductory period were significantly more likely to think about quitting at least once a day than those contacted before the new packages debuted, the study found. But the shock value may have worn off over time; a year after the design change smokers reported little difference in their thinking between baseline and follow-up. . As the packages became more commonplace, smokers became more likely to exhibit shame about their habit by hiding the box or prematurely stubbing out cigarettes. Both actions happened much more often among smokers surveyed after the redesign was fully implemented.  . The effects of the new packages on quitting behavior were modest, the researchers acknowledge in the study, published in the journal Tobacco Control. And larger, longer-term studies will be needed to see if the boxes with graphic warnings can convince smokers to quit for good.  . But it’s a good start, particularly for trying to stop young people from picking up that first cigarette, said Janet Hoek, co-director of Aspire2025, an organization of researchers for a tobacco-free New Zealand and a professor of marketing at the University of Otago in Dunedin. . “Cigarette packages have been meticulously crafted so they communicate attributes that will appeal to young people, the tobacco industry’s replacement smokers, and reassure existing smokers,” said Hoek, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “If tobacco packages are no longer glamorous or appealing, but are instead unattractive and off-putting, fewer young people will be tempted,” she told Reuters Health in an email. . Plain packages can have three positive effects in the push to deter smoking, Gerard Hastings, director of the Institute for Social Marketing at the University of Stirling in Scotland, said by email.  . “It strips away the branding which draws people to the pack, removes any false reassurance that features like pastel colors and soothing descriptors are designed to provide, and makes the health warning more prominent,” said Hastings, who wasn’t involved in the study. . Australia is a leader in this effort, Mohammed Al-hamdani, a tobacco control researcher from Saint Mary’s University in Nova Scotia, Canada, said by email.  . “The effectiveness of a health warning is higher on the new plain packages because this form of packaging strips cigarette packages from all of its (branding) imagery elements,” said Al-hamdani, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The rest of the world should follow Australia’s bold steps toward the tobacco endgame.” .

Carey Gillam|(Reuters) - A World Health Organization group’s controversial finding that the world’s most popular herbicide “probably is carcinogenic to humans” was based on a thorough scientific review and is a key marker in ongoing evaluations of the product, the scientist who led the study said Thursday. . “There were several studies. There was sufficient evidence in animals, limited evidence in humans and strong supporting evidence showing DNA mutations ... and damaged chromosomes,” Aaron Blair, a scientist emeritus at the National Cancer Institute, said in an interview. . Blair chaired the 17-member working group of the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which rocked the agricultural industry on March 20 by classifying glyphosate as “probably” cancer-causing. . Monsanto Co , which has built a $15 billion company on sales of glyphosate-based Roundup herbicide and crops genetically engineered to tolerate being sprayed with Roundup, has demanded a retraction and explanation from WHO.  . Monsanto officials have accused the IARC group of relying on  “junk science” and basing conclusion on politics rather than sound science. Company officials say glyphosate has been proven safe for decades.  . “We are in the process of determining the best path forward,” Monsanto spokesman William Brennan said. “Monsanto would like to understand how this conclusion could be reached and how the IARC process differs from other scientific reviews.” . But Blair said Thursday the classification is appropriate based on current science. There have been hundreds of studies on glyphosate, he said, with concerns about the chemical growing over time. The IARC group gave particular consideration to two major studies out of Sweden, one out of Canada and at least three in the United States, he said. . He stressed that the group did not classify glyphosate as  definitely causing cancer. . “We looked at, ‘Is there evidence that glyphosate causes cancer?’ and the answer is ‘probably.’ That is different than yes,” said Blair. . He said the scientific understanding of glyphosate impacts is still evolving.  . “It is different than smoking and lung cancer. We don’t say smoking probably causes cancer. We say it does cause cancer. At one point we weren’t sure, but now we are.” . Blair said the criticism of his group’s conclusion was not surprising given the widespread use of glyphosate. . “These sorts of things are going to go on as evidence is evaluated and scrutinized. That is what science is in democracy.” |Thu Mar 26 18:32:49 +0000 2015||Scientist defends WHO group report linking herbicide to cancer |5.811619028244316e+17|http://reut.rs/1HOQzY6
Will Dunham|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is no sign the Ebola virus is mutating in an accelerated way that could make it more virulent or thwart vaccines or drugs under development despite some earlier fears to the contrary, researchers said on Thursday. . Earlier analyses had suggested to some experts that the virus might have been mutating at twice the rate observed in previous outbreaks, raising fears it could become even deadlier. . But a study backed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Science found the virus was changing at about the same rate as in prior outbreaks. . “The data really shows that the virus isn’t changing any more than would be expected. So, for example, it doesn’t appear to be becoming more virulent or more transmissible,” said virologist David Safronetz of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the researchers. . “I would say it’s definitely reassuring,” Safronetz added. . The biggest Ebola outbreak to date, centered in three West African countries, has killed more than 10,000 people but is showing signs of waning.  . The researchers analyzed genetic information on the virus from samples taken over nine months last year from patients in Guinea in March, patients in Sierra Leone last June and patients last November in Mali who were infected in Guinea. . The routine genetic changes observed indicate the viral mutations are not likely to affect diagnostic testing or the effectiveness of experimental Ebola vaccines or drugs, the researchers said. . There are no approved vaccines or medicines for Ebola. There had been concern that a rapidly mutating virus could present a tricky moving target that could complicate efforts to develop ways to prevent and treat the virus. . “This does not appear to be a moving target,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIAID’s director. . Ebola is transmitted only through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Fauci said the findings also allay concerns raised by some last year that a rapidly changing virus could change how Ebola is transmitted, becoming airborne or respiratory. . Also in the journal Science, researchers led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin and the University of Tokyo described promising results in monkeys from an experimental vaccine, one of several in the works. . They called it a safe, inactivated whole-virus vaccine that primes the recipient’s immune system with the full complement of Ebola viral proteins and genes. |Thu Mar 26 18:32:49 +0000 2015||Study finds no sign Ebola virus is mutating out of control |5.811619010208481e+17|http://reut.rs/1HOQyn1
|(Reuters) - Denmark’s Novo Nordisk said on Thursday it had decided to submit interim analysis data from a clinical trial of its crucial new insulin drug Tresiba to U.S. regulators within the next month. . The decision is likely to be a relief to investors, since a decision not to file on Tresiba and the related drug Ryzodeg would have further delayed a launch in the world’s biggest market. . The U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) asked Novo to conduct the dedicated cardiovascular risk trial, known as DEVOTE, after refusing to approve Tresiba in 2013 because of worries it might be linked to higher rates of heart attacks or strokes. . Novo had previously said it would decide during the first half of this year whether to submit interim or full trial results. Waiting for full results would have jeopardized its aim of getting to market in 2016. . Tresiba, an ultra-long-acting form of insulin that is also known as degludec, is seen as a crucial future growth driver for the world’s top insulin maker as it battles to maintain market share in the face of stiff competition. . Industry analysts forecast it will generate annual sales of $2.2 billion by 2020, according to consensus estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.  . Novo noted that results from an interim trial analysis carried a higher level of uncertainty than final study data. “Accordingly, the relative risk estimate that has been derived from the interim analysis is thus only an indication of the final trial results,” it said in a statement. . Following the submission, the FDA is expected to communicate either its acceptance of the filing or issue a so-called incomplete response letter within a month. |Thu Mar 26 18:14:59 +0000 2015||Novo Nordisk filing move brings Tresiba closer to U.S. market |5.811574130820219e+17|http://reut.rs/1HOI2V6
Katie Nguyen|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than a dozen countries have agreed to enforce laws to fight trafficking in human organs, a business that exploits the world’s poorest people and earns criminals up to $1.2 billion in illegal profits every year. . Albania, Austria, Belgium and Britain were among 14 nations to sign the first ever international treaty to combat the trade,  Europe’s leading human rights body said on Thursday. . With an estimated 10,000 black market transplants carried out each year, the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs would make it a crime to extract organs from people without their “free, informed and specific consent”. . It would also make it illegal for the donor or a third party to make money from organ transplants and gives victims the right to compensation. . “Most of the trafficking of kidneys and other organs in the world flows from poor to rich countries, and within poor countries, from poor to rich people,” said Ivan Koedjikov, head of Action against Crime at the Council of Europe. . “In most cases it’s the most vulnerable who give,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. . The typical recipient of a donated organ is male, 48 and earns an annual income of $53,000 while the typical organ donor is male, 29, and earns less than $500 annually, according to Organs Watch, a human rights group that documents the global trade in organs.    . Citing figures from the Global Financial Integrity watchdog, the Council of Europe says the illicit trade in human organs is worth between $600 million and $1.2 billion every year. . In Europe alone, there were more than 68,000 people on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in 2012. . Recipients can pay anywhere between $50,000 and $100,000 for a kidney, liver, heart or other organ, Koedjikov said. . “Of course it cannot happen without some sort of aiding and abetting or involvement of medical doctors, of the establishment,” he added.  . “So the Convention also establishes corporate liability for this. If the criminal acts have been done by somebody in a position of responsibility, there could be corporate or hospital liability.” . Five countries have to ratify the treaty, which is open to all countries, before it comes into force. So far, the other signatories are the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Moldova, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Turkey. . Trafficking in organs occurs when traffickers force or deceive the victims into giving up an organ, or when victims agree to sell an organ but are not paid in full or at all. . In other cases, organs are removed without the victim’s knowledge during medical treatment.  |Thu Mar 26 18:14:58 +0000 2015||Black market trade in organs targeted in anti-trafficking treaty |5.81157410573779e+17|http://reut.rs/1xCknr7
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - French drugmaker Genfit SA said on Thursday it will  begin a late stage trial later this year of its lead treatment for a liver-destroying condition, saying it failed a midstage trial in part due to its inclusion of many patients with a mild form of the disease. . The company said had it excluded data from those patients with the mildest form of the disease known as NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) its drug, called GFT505, would have been deemed effective in reversing the condition. Company officials said Genfit would likely include only more seriously ill patients in its planned Phase III trials which will test 1,500 to 2,000 patients. . Due to the unexpected rate of resolution of NASH in patients who received a placebo and the large number of test sites with very few patients, the trial did not reach its intended goal, the company said. . When adjusting for those factors, the results were “quite robust for NASH,” Dean Hum, the company’s chief scientific officer told Reuters in an interview. . GFT505 also demonstrated a favorable effect on metabolic factors, lowering bad LDL cholesterol as well as unhealthy blood fats called triglycerides and levels of blood glucose. NASH has been closely associated with obesity and diabetes. . Heart disease remains the number one killer of NASH patients and at least one rival experiential treatment, from Intercept Pharmaceuticals, has caused concern because it has raised LDL levels in trials.  . “This trial confirms 505 is cardioprotective,” Hum said. “This is a clear differentiation between 505 and some other compounds.” . Shares of Intercept rose 10 percent after Thursday’s mixed results for the rival Genfit drug. . There are currently no approved treatments for NASH, which  affects millions of people, primarily in developed nations. . Several companies are pursuing NASH treatments, including Gilead Sciences Inc and Conatus Pharmaceuticals, which earlier on Thursday said its experimental drug, emricasan, was more effective than a placebo in a mid-stage fatty liver disease study. Its shares jumped more than 26 percent. . Analysts have said any effective treatment for NASH or the complications it causes, such as the scarring known as fibrosis and cirrhosis, could capture annual sales of $10 billion. |Thu Mar 26 17:41:11 +0000 2015||Genfit to conduct large liver drug trial despite setback |5.811489086315397e+17|http://reut.rs/1HOs4KH
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control is launching an ad campaign warning consumers against the dual use of e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes. . E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat a nicotine-laced liquid to produce an inhalable vapor. Nationally, about three in four adult e-cigarette users also smoke cigarettes, the CDC said. . “If you only cut down the number of cigarettes you smoke by adding another tobacco product, like e-cigarettes, you still face serious health risks,” the CDC said in a statement. “Smokers must quit smoking completely to fully protect their health - even a few cigarettes a day are dangerous.” . The ads, which will begin running in print publications and radio on Monday, feature a 35-year-old named Kristy who tried using e-cigarettes to quit smoking, but wound up using both products. She suffered a collapsed lung and was diagnosed with COPD, a chronic lung disease, before quitting altogether. . The ads build on the CDC’s “Tips From Former Smokers” campaign, which was launched in 2012. . Most experts agree that e-cigarettes are likely safer than traditional cigarettes, but early data suggests many e-cigarette users are also continuing to smoke cigarettes. . Such data could have implications for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s proposed regulation of e-cigarettes. Tobacco companies are developing products that they hope to show reduce harm from smoking. . In order to receive FDA approval to make such a claim, they must prove the products not only reduce risk to an individual who switches or quits but also to the population as a whole. . The FDA has proposed reviewing new products before they are allowed to be sold and prohibiting sales of the devices to minors. It expects to publish its final rule in June. . Cigarette smoking kills more than 480,000 Americans each year. For each of those, about 30 more suffer at least one serious smoking-related illness. |Thu Mar 26 17:14:18 +0000 2015||U.S. ad campaign points to dangers of dual cigarette/e-cig use |5.811421421033677e+17|http://reut.rs/1xCcxOp
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Men who are more fit in middle-age are less likely to be diagnosed with lung or colorectal cancers years later, according to a new long-term study. . Fitter men were also much less likely to die if they were diagnosed with cancer later in life, compared to less fit men, the authors found. . “Among the men who developed cancer, those who were more fit at middle age had a lower risk of dying from all the three cancers studied, as well as cardiovascular disease,” said lead author Dr. Susan G. Lakoski of the University of Vermont in Colchester. . “Even a small improvement in fitness (by 1 MET) made a significant difference in survival - reducing the risks of dying from cancer and cardiovascular disease by 10 and 25 percent, respectively,” she told Reuters Health by email. . One MET, or Metabolic Equivalent of Task, would translate, for example, to running  an 11.5-minute mile compared to a 12-minute mile, she explained. . Researchers used data from a long-term study of more than 13,000 men who were an average of 49 years old when they had a comprehensive physical exam, a cardiovascular risk factor assessment and completed a treadmill test of fitness level between 1971 and 2009. . For the fitness test, the men started out walking on a treadmill at a moderate speed. Researchers first incrementally increased the incline  over 25 minutes, then began to increase the speed, and recorded how long the men could continue until they were exhausted. . The researchers divided the men into three fitness categories, including the 20 percent who remained on the treadmill for the least amount of time, the middle 40 percent and the top 40 percent. . Once the participants turned 65, the researchers looked at Medicare records for diagnoses of lung, prostate and colorectal cancer, and used the National Death Index to find data on deaths from cancer or cardiovascular disease. . Over an average of six years while the men were eligible for Medicare, 1,310 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 200 with lung cancer and 181 with colorectal cancer.  . Those in the high-fitness group were less than half as likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer as those in the lowest-fitness group, and the difference was similar for colorectal cancer.  . The researchers did not find a link between fitness and prostate cancer risk. . By the end of the study, 20 percent of the men in the lowest-fitness tier had died, compared to four percent in the moderate-fitness group and three percent in the high fitness group.  . Those in the highest-fitness group were 32 percent less likely to die from cancer-related causes and 68 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular disease-related causes than those in the lowest-fitness group, according to the results in JAMA Oncology. . Fitness is largely determined by how much someone has been physically active, and for how long, Lakoski said, and may be an important clinical marker of cancer risk. . “These findings provide support for the utility of (cardiorespiratory fitness) assessment, via maximal exercise treadmill testing, in preventive health care settings and possibly following a diagnosis of cancer,” she said. . Current activity guidelines for adults, recommending at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day, five days per week, are based on the dose of exercise linked to heart health, said Edward Archer of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who was not involved in the new study. . “Fitness has a huge impact with breast cancer and lung cancer as well, it’s a dramatic relationship but we really don’t know the dose specifics of how many minutes per day,” Archer told Reuters Health. . “If you are meeting the guidelines, that’s a huge step,” he said. . Prostate cancer is very slow growing and seems to have almost no relationship with environmental risk factors, so being fit may not influence it, he added. . Archer noted that the new research only associated fitness and cancer risk over time, and did not specifically test whether becoming more fit would cause cancer risk to decrease. . “Working out at a moderate or vigorous intensity will improve fitness,” Lakoski said. “Our next steps in our research are to determine the absolute change in fitness to lower risk of all major cancers in men and women.” . “If that is determined, then exercise training regimens can be built to close the fitness gap,” she said. .

|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Morphosys and Celgene have agreed to end their cooperation on MOR202, but clinical trials of the drug candidate will continue, Morphosys said on Thursday. . Morphosys said it aimed to release first clinical data from the ongoing phase 1/2a trial at a medical conference in 2015. . It also raised its 2015 profit guidance, saying it expected to post 2015 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of between 9 and 16 million euros ($9.8-17.5 million), because it can book revenue this year that had been deferred as part of the cooperation and it will receive a one-time payment from Celgene for development costs. .

Susan Cornwell|WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill to permanently repair the formula for reimbursing Medicare physicians, marking a rare bipartisan achievement and sending the issue next to the Senate. . The measure drafted and driven forward by Republican House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi would fix a long-standing problem with how Medicare pays doctors. It would also make adjustments to the health program for seniors. . The House vote was 392-37. . The Senate may not act until it returns from a two-week recess that starts this weekend. Some senators in both parties had concerns about the bill, but it also had strong support. . Democratic President Barack Obama praised the House passage and said he hoped the Senate would approve the measure too, because he wants to sign it. . “I called the Speaker, John Boehner, and the Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and I said, congratulations, this is how Congress is supposed to work. They came together; they compromised,” Obama said during a trip to Birmingham, Alabama. “This is great. Let’s do more of this.” . The Boehner-Pelosi measure would replace a 1990s formula that linked doctor pay to economic growth with a new one more focused on quality of care. It also would require means-testing of Medicare beneficiaries so higher income people pay higher premiums. . The legislation was designed to spare Medicare doctors a 21-percent pay cut effective April 1 under the existing payment formula. If the Senate does not act until mid-April, doctors might still be able to avoid pay cuts because Medicare doctors’ claims generally take at least 14 days to be paid. . One of the government’s largest social safety net programs, Medicare is health insurance that serves 54 million elderly and disabled people. . Under the plan, a Medicare recipient with annual income of between $133,000 and $160,000 would see their Medicare premium share increase from 50 to 65 percent, and a recipient with annual income between $160,000 and $214,000 would pay 75 percent rather than 65 percent. . But the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Robert Moffit said this was “timid” reform affecting just 6 percent of the Medicare population.    . Wall Street analysts, who have been skeptical about the bill, said it would help healthcare services companies whose revenues depend on government Medicare reimbursements. .      More broadly, the bill could be a positive sign for chances of bipartisan agreement on coping with health care industry changes that could come if the U.S. Supreme Court in June rules against federal subsidies under Obamacare, said analyst Brian Tanquilut at investment bank Jefferies in a research note. . He added that this could help the stock prices of hospital companies, such as Community Health Systems, HCA Holdings Inc and Tenet Healthcare. . The proposal would add $141 billion to the U.S. deficit over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday. . Its overall cost would be about $214 billion, but about $73 billion would be offset through savings in the bill, CBO said. . Despite the addition to the deficit, Boehner said it was the first real reform to U.S. “entitlement” programs in nearly 20 years and marked a start to solving the U.S. “spending problem.” . “This is what we can accomplish when we are focused on common ground,” Boehner said on the House floor. Pelosi said she hoped the bipartisan effort “will be a model of things to come.” . The legislation includes a two-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for low-income children and a two-year extension of funding for community health centers. Both were high priorities for Democrats. . However, some Senate Democrats have expressed concern about anti-abortion language in the bill and their desire for four years, not two, of CHIP funding. And conservative Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said Thursday he was concerned because the bill was not totally paid for. . Congressional gridlock in recent years has decreased the chances of any bill’s becoming law. . Most of those voting against the bill in the House were conservative Republicans opposed to the deficit impact. “You obviously have got to be concerned about the cost when you have a debt situation the way we do,” said Representative Jim Jordan. |Thu Mar 26 16:40:00 +0000 2015||U.S. House approves bipartisan fix to Medicare doctors pay |5.811335111192494e+17|http://reut.rs/1HNYiG7
Kieran Guilbert|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Escalating violence by Boko Haram militants in recent months has uprooted hundreds of thousands in northeast Nigeria and led to a “humanitarian crisis”, aid agencies said on Thursday, amid fears that post-election unrest could hamper aid efforts. . More than 1.2 million people have been displaced within Nigeria, while almost 200,000 have fled to neighboring Niger, Chad and Cameroon since Boko Haram launched an uprising in 2009, according to the United Nations.  . The militant group has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds during its six-year campaign to carve out an Islamist state in northern Nigeria, and violence has escalated significantly this year, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.   . “Thousands of people have been killed, injured and affected by violence in northeast Nigeria this year,” IFRC representative Daniel Bolanos said. “This is a humanitarian crisis which is not just affecting Nigeria but surrounding countries as well. . “If elections go ahead as planned, more violence is expected in the coming weeks,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . This weekend’s election, a race between President Goodluck Jonathan and former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, is being tipped as the closest and most polarizing vote since Africa’s most populous nation returned to civilian rule in 1999. . Nigeria’s last presidential poll in 2011 - also between Jonathan and Buhari - was deemed the cleanest to date in the country, but 800 people were killed in the aftermath. . Post-poll violence could hinder humanitarian access to people displaced in the northeast, said Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher at Amnesty International. . “It is a tense time around elections and security forces are already stretched thin,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . “Displaced people are already struggling for food, access to clean water and healthcare facilities.”  . Around nine in 10 internally displaced people were living with relatives or host families, placing massive strain on local communities, Eyre said. . Those living in refugee camps in Cameroon and Niger were trading possessions for food due to a lack of aid, he added. . More than 74,000 Nigerian refugees have crossed the border into Cameroon, according to U.N. estimates, including around 25,000 in February alone who escaped clashes between the regional military forces and Boko Haram insurgents. . In addition to providing people with food, water and clothing, the IFRC is working to reunite families affected by conflict and provide psychological support, Bolanos said. |Thu Mar 26 16:01:48 +0000 2015||Post-election unrest could hamper aid efforts in Nigeria |5.811238971369103e+17|http://reut.rs/1xC2poT
Steve Bittenbender|(Reuters) - Indiana’s governor on Thursday authorized the short-term use of a needle-exchange program in a rural county to combat the biggest outbreak of HIV infections in state history, all tied to intravenous prescription drug abuse. . Republican Governor Mike Pence said he personally opposes needle-exchange programs but signed an emergency order allowing one recommended by federal health officials to be used in Scott County in southern Indiana near the Kentucky border. . Scott County has recorded 80 HIV cases since December, all tied to injected drugs. Under the order, which lasts 30 days, the county can set up a needle-exchange program with the state health department limited to suppressing the outbreak. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. . Pence said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the program and he was willing to support one if county officials want it. . “This is all hands on deck,” Pence told a news conference. . Such programs provide intravenous drug users with sterile needles in an effort to prevent infections from the sharing of contaminated needles. Some opponents of such programs say needle exchanges encourage drug use. . The county in past years has reported fewer than five new HIV cases annually, according to state statistics. . A state health department spokeswoman said this is believed to be the worst HIV outbreak on record for Indiana. It is unique also because officials say all the cases have been tied to intravenous drug use. . Initial cases were diagnosed after people injected themselves with the powerful painkiller Opana, which contains oxymorphone, officials said. People also have become infected after injecting other drugs including methamphetamine, officials said. . Scott County officials say they have been fighting narcotics, and in particular prescription drug use, for several years, and the HIV outbreak has raised the level of concern. . Since December, the county about 35 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, has had 71 confirmed HIV cases and nine preliminary positive results. Officials fear up to 100 cases could be identified. |Thu Mar 26 16:01:48 +0000 2015||Indiana governor allows needle exchange to fight HIV outbreak |5.811238952579195e+17|http://reut.rs/1xC2poV
Alex Whiting|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the wake of the Ebola crisis, a quiet revolution is taking place that is set to transform the way governments and aid agencies respond to major disease outbreaks. . Analysts are developing insurance schemes that could turn the humanitarian system on its head, by paying out money as soon as a disease breaks out to stop it becoming an international crisis, rather than trying to raise funds after the event.  . The World Bank, the African Union, a consortium of aid agencies and experts in the private sector are starting to do the sums and figure out what such schemes could look like.  . “This is a really exciting time. What the crisis of last year has done is to cause an upheaval in the whole of the humanitarian sector in terms of thinking of how to mitigate disasters, rather than just respond afterwards,” Gordon Woo, a catastrophist specializing in pandemics at Risk Management Solutions, said in a telephone interview. . Unlike events like earthquakes, the spread of a contagious disease rapidly pushes up the cost of halting it, the death toll and the economic damage unless swift action is taken.    . The World Health Organization’s (WHO) first major Ebola appeal was for $71 million in August last year, months after Guinea had reported the Ebola outbreak in March. By mid-September $1 billion was needed, the United Nations said, and the costs have risen steeply since then.  . Even though Ebola was deemed a global threat, donor funds were slow to materialize.      . “It’s like having a fire in your kitchen. If you don’t deal with it, your whole house could burn down ... it’s not the time to start haggling over who should be putting out the fire,” Woo said.      . Pandemics top the list of extreme risks that matter most for the insurance industry over the long term, according to a 2013 survey of 30,000 insurance industry experts by Towers Watson.  . Typically, insurers pay out after losses have occurred. “The novelty here is to try and come up with financial instruments which trigger when there are signs that something bad is on the horizon. It’s like early warning,” Woo said.         . The African Union recently set up an insurance fund for countries affected by natural disasters, and is exploring insurance for epidemics.      . The African Risk Capacity began with a $200 million fund, donated by British and German development institutions. Countries pay premiums into the fund and receive payouts when certain measurable criteria are met.  . For countries to qualify for the insurance scheme, they have to develop rigorous contingency plans to ensure payouts from the fund reach the most vulnerable people quickly in the event of a crisis. . The World Bank is consulting with the African Union, the United Nations and national governments to develop a Pandemic Emergency Facility, which could include an insurance scheme that would pay out to governments and international bodies like the WHO. . “The better our response, the greater our ability to save lives and safeguard development gains,” Joachim von Amsberg, vice president of development finance at the World Bank, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  . The Bank has said the Ebola outbreak may cost West Africa up to $15 billion over the next three years in lost trade, investment and tourism. . “A key part of this response is to make sure the money is available at the first sign of a health crisis,” von Amsberg said. . Aid agencies are also exploring insurance schemes they could draw on in the event of a pandemic.  . “The potential is brilliant, but the question is whether we can convert it into something affordable and workable,” said Emily Montier, crisis anticipation advisor for the Start Network of 19 humanitarian agencies. . The Network is exploring with Risk Management Solutions the possibility of issuing bonds, which can leverage a greater pay-out. But because of the risk to investors, the premiums would be expensive, so the insurance scheme would only be suitable for the rare occasion when a large payout was needed. . As with governments, NGOs would need rigorous plans in place and the capacity to scale up their work quickly to qualify for a payout from an insurance scheme. . African Risk Capacity is using bonds to leverage private capital for an insurance scheme it is developing to help countries manage the risks of climate change. It hopes to issue more than $1 billion of African climate change bonds over a period of 30 years, starting in 2016.     . Woo said pandemic insurance schemes could play a pivotal role in protecting countries against major outbreaks.  .     “Essentially it’s providing a safety net for the whole world. It’s nothing short of that,” he said. |Thu Mar 26 15:05:36 +0000 2015||New pandemic insurance to prevent crises through early payouts |5.811097526100746e+17|http://reut.rs/1HNcAGR
|STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish pharmaceutical company Medivir is in ongoing discussions to license hepatitis C drug candidate MIV-802 to another firm, it said on Thursday.  . In December Medivir said MIV-802 had been selected as a candidate drug and entered non-clinical development. . “It is almost unlikely that we will take it trough a phase-II,” Chief Executive Niklas Prager told a meeting of investors, analysts and media and added that it is more likely that the company will sign a partner agreement for the drug candidate’s further development. . “We have discussions going on in that area,” Prager said. . Medivir has the ambition to deliver on average one drug candidate every year, and to maintain an average of one project in the first phase of clinical development. |Thu Mar 26 14:49:40 +0000 2015||Sweden's Medivir in partner talks for drug candidate MIV-802 |5.81105743551701e+17|http://reut.rs/1xBQIyj
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Diabetics with nerve damage are more likely to have an uneven stride and struggle to maintain their balance even when walking on flat ground, a small study finds. . So-called peripheral neuropathy, or diabetic nerve damage, can lead to numbness and pain in the feet, legs and hands. It is the most common complication of diabetes, and though it has long been linked to an increased risk of falls, less is known about how specific body movements contribute to balance problems during daily activities such as walking or climbing stairs. . “By investigating the activities during which falls are more likely to occur, we can look to identify specific detriments of the underlying balance mechanisms, allowing a more targeted and educated approach to preventing falls within this population in the future,” lead author Steven Brown, of Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, said in an email interview. . About one in nine adults has diabetes, and the disease will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, according to the World Health Organization.  . Most of these people have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and advanced age and happens when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy.  . Roughly 70 percent of diabetics have some form of neuropathy, according to the National Institutes of Health. While the risk increases the longer people live with diabetes, nerve damage may be limited by keeping blood sugar as close to normal as possible. . To understand how nerve damage impacts gait and balance, Brown and colleagues analyzed the body mechanics of 22 diabetics with neuropathy while walking on flat ground and going up and down stairs. They compared the results to 39 diabetics without neuropathy and a control group of 28 people without diabetes. . The researchers did a gait analysis using a 10-camera motion capture system to collect data as participants moved on stairs and on flat ground. Everybody wore similar shoes, to ensure that footwear didn’t influence results.  . The diabetics with nerve pain moved at significantly slower speeds than the other study participants. . On stairs, front-to-back sway as well as side-to-side sway, which increase with poor balance, was significantly higher for the diabetics with neuropathy than for the people without diabetes. And front-to-back sway was also significantly greater for diabetics with nerve pain when they walked on level ground. . Standing still with open eyes, the diabetics with neuropathy had more front-to-back and side-to-side sway than the other study participants, and more than the control group when the test was repeated with eyes closed.  . The diabetics with nerve pain also tended to stand with their feet spread further apart, a stance probably adopted to compensate for balance issues that can, in fact, increase the risk of falls, the researchers write in Diabetes Care.  . There are some steps diabetics can take to stay on their feet even when they suffer from nerve pain, said Dr. James Richardson, a researcher at the University of Michigan Health System.  . To decrease the chances of falling, diabetics need to have good vision or good control of ankle movements, strong hips, good reflexes, and avoid distractions while moving, said Richardson, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . Regular eye exams and good light can help with vision problems, and lightly touching a railing or wall can help with balance when it’s hard to see, Richardson noted. And some exercises may be able to strengthen muscles around the hips.  . At the end of the day, though, concentration is key. . “It doesn’t matter if the muscles are strong if they are strong three seconds after you lose your balance,” he said. “You only have about half a second before you hit the ground.” .

Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - European governments need to be better at sharing expertise about the cost-effectiveness of new medicines to counter the budget strains posed by the arrival of a wave of costly drugs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . Only a few countries across Europe have robust systems in place to evaluate whether drugs are worth using at the prices asked by manufacturers, the WHO said. . What is more, drug supply and pricing is often fixed through deals between governments and drugmakers that are “generally rather opaque”, making it difficult to achieve the transparency needed to help reduce prices. . The United Nations health agency’s intervention comes amid growing debate about the value of new medicines. Assessing the economic benefit of drugs is outside the remit of licensing bodies such as the European Medicines Agency. . “The ultimate goal is to protect patients’ interests and to ensure that they are not provided with expensive new medicines that offer little or no improvement in health outcomes,” said Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. . The WHO, which set out the challenges facing Europe in a 180-page paper on Thursday, said the issue was most acute in low- and middle-income countries with less developed health systems. . The drug industry is currently enjoying a research-led revival, with more new therapies reaching the market, especially for chronic diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes and hepatitis C. . But costs for some drugs are rising at an “unsustainable” rate, with cancer-drug prices doubling in 10 years to a typical range of $6,000-10,000 a month, “often with little relationship between reimbursed costs and associated health benefits”, the WHO said. . The result is very uneven access to drugs across Europe as governments employ a range of methods such as restrictive treatment guidelines, target levels for use of generics and limitations on the use of particularly expensive drugs to rein in bills. . The cost of new drugs is a hot topic not just for doctors and politicians, but also investors. . The development of a new generation of hepatitis C pills, led by Gilead’s Sovaldi, which costs $1,000 per tablet in the United States, has helped crystallize the debate, with the WHO joining the clamor last year to make them more affordable.  . While such high drug prices have boosted profits, especially at successful biotech companies, some investors fear they may be eroded by growing pushback from healthcare providers. |Thu Mar 26 12:50:26 +0000 2015||WHO urges Europeans to work together to counter high drug prices |5.810757386081812e+17|http://reut.rs/1HMb4Vk
|(Reuters) - Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc said its experimental lead drug was more effective than a placebo in a mid-stage study in patients with a form of fatty liver disease. . The company’s stock soared more than 50 percent before the bell on Thursday. . The drug, emricasan, was tested in 38 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including some sufferers of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of the condition, the company said. . NASH is one of the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality, but no pharmaceutical therapy currently exists for it. . Several drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences Inc, Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc and France’s Genfit SA, are in the race to develop treatments. . The study determined the drug’s effectiveness by measuring reductions in biomarkers associated with cell death and inflammation, considered to be drivers of progressive liver disease. . The treatment had no adverse effects on lipid levels or insulin sensitivity in these patients, who are typically at risk of cardiovascular disease, Conatus said. . Emricasan is Conatus’ most advanced drug-in-development and is designed to interrupt disease progression across the spectrum of liver disease. . The treatment, which is being tested for multiple liver indications, is initially being developed for liver cirrhosis, or severe scarring that may be caused by all manner of assaults on the liver. . Conatus estimates that about 2 million people in the United States and five largest European markets have cirrhosis and varying degrees of liver impairment. . The company’s shares were up nearly 42 percent at $8.16 in heavy premarket trading. |Thu Mar 26 11:34:03 +0000 2015||Conatus Pharma's liver drug succeeds in mid-stage study |5.810565136047391e+17|http://reut.rs/1xBp84o

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Employers have ratcheted up the financial incentives they offer workers to participate in wellness programs to a record $693 per employee, on average, this year from $594 in 2014 and $430 five years ago, found a report released on Thursday. . And fewer employers are imposing penalties such as charging more for insurance if workers do not participate or achieve goals such as losing weight. . However, the findings - from a survey of 121 representative U.S. employers by Fidelity Investments and the National Business Group on Health - come as workplace wellness programs are increasingly coming under scrutiny. . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission took legal action last year against three companies, including Honeywell International Inc (. ), alleging their wellness programs violated federal anti-discrimination laws. . Congress is now involved and bills have been introduced allow company practices, and even classify as “voluntary” programs that penalize workers. . Although businesses insist the programs are popular with workers, a guide for employers released this month by pro-wellness groups lists “employee morale” as one of their “tangential costs,” as well as “company reputation” and “legal challenges.” . “If employees love these programs, how come companies need to bribe them to participate?” asked healthcare consultant Al Lewis, a critic of claims that wellness programs cut medical spending by employers. . “This jump in incentives shows the report is right: morale takes a hit from workplace wellness programs.” . Robert Kennedy, who leads Fidelity’s health consulting practice, rejected that claim, saying high incentives reflect “employers’ broad interest in employees’ health.” . The survey found that 79 percent of employers offer wellness programs, which can include health questionnaires, blood tests and other “biometric” screening, and smoking cessation and weight-loss classes. . Companies with more than 20,000 employees are offering an average of $878 this year to induce workers to participate. Companies with 5,000 to 20,000 workers are offering $661, up from $493 in 2014. . The incentives take the form of cash, reduced insurance premiums or contributions to a healthcare account. . To get more employees to participate, some employers began designing incentives as penalties, but in now falling out favor. Only 6 percent of employers said they penalize workers for not answering health risk assessments, down from 11 percent in 2014. Five percent penalize them for not getting a biometric screening, down from 12 percent. . The inducements still fall short, however. Only 47 percent of employees took part in all the wellness activities offered by employers, even with the rewards. |Thu Mar 26 04:30:37 +0000 2015||Employer incentives for U.S. worker wellness programs set record |5.809499560700969e+17|http://reut.rs/1HJjZac
Anastasia Moloney|BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cholera will continue to kill and infect Haitians as long as they lack access to clean water and sanitation, with a thousand new cases reported each week, health experts say. . Cholera, a water-borne disease caught by drinking and using contaminated water, has killed nearly 9,000 Haitians and infected 732,000 since it broke out in the country in late 2010. . With the lowest levels of access to drinking water and sanitation in the Americas, Haiti is struggling to stamp out cholera, which resurged between October and December last year, said the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). . During the first two months of this year, cholera cases totaled 7,225, including 86 deaths - higher than recorded during the same period in 2012 and 2014, said PAHO, the regional arm of the World Health Organization. . “We cannot be complacent. We can’t take our eyes off the ball,” PAHO deputy director Isabella Danel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. . “Cholera comes and goes... This will not go away until the real problem of water and sanitation is solved. That will require a scale-up of financing and capacity.” . Infectious diseases such as cholera thrive in the overcrowded slums sprawled across the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. With few toilets there, people are forced to defecate in the open. Cases normally spike during Haiti’s rainy season, from September to November. . More prosperous Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti but has a stronger health system, has reported more than 32,000 cholera cases and 480 deaths since 2010, PAHO said. . Cholera causes diarrhea and vomiting that often brings on severe dehydration, which if not treated quickly can be fatal. . Many Haitians blame cholera on U.N. peacekeeping troops from Nepal, who they say introduced the disease to Haiti. . Forty percent of Haiti’s population of 10 million do not have access to clean water, while nearly half of the country’s hospitals lack either drinking water or sanitation, PAHO says. . Furthermore, 60 percent of Haiti’s schools lack toilets, according to Human Rights Watch. . PAHO, the Haitian government and aid agencies have conducted awareness campaigns on the need to wash hands with clean water to stem cholera infection, and water purification programs using chlorine have been set up. . Since 2012, nearly 200,000 Haitians have received an oral vaccine to better protect them against cholera. . While such measures have significantly reduced cholera deaths, the U.N. says 28,000 more Haitians could be infected this year. . The government is unable to cope with peaks in cholera as the country’s health sector is still recovering from the massive 2010 earthquake, says medical charity Doctors Without Borders. . In a bid to rid Haiti of cholera, the government launched a 10-year $2.2 billion appeal in 2013 to provide clean water and sanitation for all Haitians by 2022. . But many donors are focused elsewhere, Danel said. . “It has been a challenge to mobilize the necessary resources owing to the multiple global crises, wars, and conflicts, and more recently the heightened focus on Ebola control and elimination,” she said. |Thu Mar 26 04:10:22 +0000 2015||Cholera will plague Haiti until water, sanitation crisis solved: experts |5.80944859407786e+17|http://reut.rs/1xAwAge
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – There is little evidence to support claims that a popular sweetener reduces the likelihood of cavities on its own, according to a new analysis of past research. . There was some evidence that xylitol reduces the risk of cavities – or caries – among children, but people should be cautious about that finding because of limitations in the previous studies, researchers report in the Cochrane Library. . “It’s put in a lot of products as a preventive agent for caries, but we weren’t sure what the evidence base was to substantiate the claims,” said Dr. Deborah Moore, one of the study’s authors from Manchester University in the UK. . Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is as sweet as traditional sugar, but is not absorbed by the body, according to the researchers. Its properties allow xylitol, which occurs naturally in plants and fruits, to be used in diabetic and “sugar-free” food products, like gum and candies. . “Xylitol is known in the laboratory to kill the main bacteria that cause tooth decay, which is why it was singled out as having possible preventive effects on tooth decay,” Moore told Reuters Health. . Moreover, she said, there is little or no risk of xylitol causing tooth decay, especially when it’s compared to regular sugar. Products that contain xylitol, like gum or lozenges, can increase the production of saliva, which also may reduce the risk of cavities. . The new review is part of The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. . The researchers compiled the best available studies comparing products containing xylitol to products with inactive ingredients. . They found 10 studies fitting their criteria, with a total of 5,903 participants. . Two studies had data on 4,216 Costa Rican children who used either xylitol- and fluoride-containing toothpaste or simply fluoride-containing toothpaste for three years and found a 13 percent reduction in cavities in the xylitol-fluoride group. . However, people should be cautious about interpreting those findings, the researchers write. The data were judged to be of low quality, and the benefits were only seen among the children who were evaluated in both of the studies, so the results could have something to do factors unique to those kids. . They also found that data on side effects were lacking for many of the studies, and they note that xylitol is linked to some stomach issues, including diarrhea. . Moore said that xylitol is better than sugar, but there is not enough evidence to say it prevents cavities on its own. . “If people are concerned about tooth decay the best thing to do is be preventive,” she said, adding that using fluoride-containing toothpaste, using mouthwash and reducing sugar consumption are the best preventive measures. . Dr. Burton Edelstein, chair of the Section of Population Oral Health at Columbia University College of Dental Medicine in New York City, agreed that more research is needed on xylitol’s potential to prevent cavities. . He cautioned that lack of evidence is not evidence against xylitol, however. . For example, Edelstein and colleagues estimate in a new report published in the Journal of the American Dental Association that money might be saved by giving mothers xylitol products because they cut the transmission of bacteria that cause tooth decay from mother to child. . Mothers may pass on the bacteria to their children through direct contact, such as sharing utensils or using their saliva to clean the baby’s pacifier or face. . Edelstein’s group estimates that for every $1 spent on xylitol products for high-risk mothers on New York’s government-run insurance programs for the poor, $1.76 will be saved over 10 years in reduced dental care for the children. . Other cost-effective measures include encouraging increased brushing among high-risk preschoolers and maximizing water fluoridation in New York, they write. . “We’re dealing with this highly prevalent and almost completely preventable disease that’s taxing public coffers,” Edelstein told Reuters Health. .

Steve Bittenbender|LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Indiana Governor Mike Pence said on Wednesday he will declare a public health disaster in a small southern Indiana county that has seen a drastic increase in HIV cases tied to intravenous prescription drug abuse since December. . “This is a public health emergency,” Pence said of the declaration for rural Scott County, located about 35 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. “Now I’m evaluating all of the issues and all of the tools that may be available to local health officials in light of a public health emergency.” . Pence spoke to reporters after meeting with county officials and representatives from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. . Since December, Scott County has had 72 confirmed HIV cases and seven preliminary ones. Officials fear potentially up to 100 cases could be identified. . In past years, Scott County reported less than five new HIV cases each year and had just 21 residents with HIV in 2014, according to state statistics. . While HIV is considered a sexually transmitted virus, the Indiana epidemic is unique because officials say all cases have been tied to intravenous drug use. . The initial cases were diagnosed after people injected themselves with the powerful painkiller Opana, which contains oxymorphone. Officials said people also have become infected after injecting other drugs, such as methamphetamine. . Pence, a Republican, said he does not think needle exchanges are a good anti-drug policy. However, he said it is under consideration for Scott County as a way of preventing the spread of HIV. . Indiana will bring in a mobile command center and make available additional state resources to help Scott County. In addition, CDC officials have been in the community since Monday to help with follow-up contacts with those diagnosed. . Officials urged those with HIV and battling drug abuse to take advantage of the resources available to treat their conditions. . Scott County officials say they have been fighting narcotics, and in particular prescription drug use, for several years, and the HIV outbreak has raised the level of concern. . “That’s when we started calling in the cavalry, like the state folks who’ve come in today to give us some help,” Scott County Sheriff Dan McClain said. |Wed Mar 25 23:06:29 +0000 2015||Indiana governor to declare disaster for county hit by HIV outbreak |5.808683844154409e+17|http://reut.rs/1HHsqTh
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The Ebola virus causing a devastating epidemic in West Africa is far more deadly in children than in adults, killing around 90 percent of babies under one who become infected, researchers said on Wednesday. . A study led by scientists at the World Health Organization (WHO) and Imperial College London found that, although infection rates are lower in children than adults, babies and toddlers who get the disease have a far slimmer chance of survival. . The virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever and induces internal and external bleeding, profuse vomiting and diarrhea, is killing 90 percent of infants in the current outbreak and around 80 percent of children aged between one to four years, the scientists found.  . Older children are much more likely to survive the disease - it has killed 52 percent of those infected aged 10 to 15. . “These findings show that Ebola affects young children quite differently to adults, and it’s especially important that we get them into treatment quickly,” said Christl Donnelly, who co-led the study Imperial’s Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling. . “We also need to look at whether young children are getting treatment that’s appropriate for their age.”  . The world’s worst Ebola epidemic has killed more than 10,200 people in total in the three most affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since March 2014 when it was first confirmed in the forest region of Guinea.     . As of March 2015, almost 4,000 children under 16 have been affected by Ebola in the current epidemic. . Donnelly’s team, whose work was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, analyzed data on Ebola cases in children under 16 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . As well as the higher risk of death in younger children, they found the incubation period - the time between becoming infected and showing symptoms - was 6.9 days in children under a year, compared with 9.8 days in children aged 10 to 15. . There were also differences in symptoms, with children more likely than adults to have a fever when they first see a doctor but less likely to have difficulty breathing or swallowing, or to have pain in the abdomen, chest, joints or muscles. . “The very youngest of children - neonates - appear to have the worst outcomes from Ebola,” said Robert Fowler, a co-researcher on the study from the University of Toronto. . He said the findings about how children suffer more show the need to “evolve more dedicated and specialized means of caring for them in an Ebola outbreak”. |Wed Mar 25 21:20:37 +0000 2015||Ebola is most deadly among babies, young children, study finds |5.808417440964485e+17|http://reut.rs/1HGNoln
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Sleeping longer one night corresponds with an increase in sexual desire and odds of intercourse the following day for women, according to a new survey-based study. . “Aspects of sexual functioning, like desire and arousal, are influenced by many areas of our lives, such as mood, medical health, fatigue, stress and relationship factors,” said lead author David A. Kalmbach of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. . Kalmbach and his coauthors studied 171 female college students  - who were not taking antidepressants, which can influence sexual function - for a two-week period. . About half of the women said they were in an intimate relationship, and more than half reported having at least one current sexual partner. . First, the women completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety and “distress” related to sex. For the next two weeks, they completed online questionnaires first thing in the morning about their quality and quantity of sleep during the night and their sexual activity over the previous 24 hours. . The participants reported their experience of sexual desire, arousal and orgasm, instances of partnered sex or masturbation and details of their menstrual cycle.  . Based on the results published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, the women reported masturbating on an average of one to two days during the 14-day survey period and engaging in partnered sex an average of three to four days.  . They slept for an average of seven hours and 22 minutes per night. . Sexual desire was higher for women taking oral contraceptives and dipped during menstruation, the authors found.  . When all these factors were accounted for, longer sleep duration predicted higher sexual desire the following day. . Sleep length and quality did not appear to be related to subjective sexual arousal, however, and sleeping longer was linked to poorer vaginal lubrication, a surprise to the authors.  . “Surprisingly, single night sleep interruptions in an uncontinuous fashion were found to increase genital arousal the following day,” said Dr. Hikmet Köseoğlu, a urologist at Baskent University in Ankara, Turkey, who was not part of the new study. . This will need to be confirmed by other studies, he told Reuters Health by email. . Shorter sleep length may lead to poorer desire and arousal, but that doesn’t mean the relationship can’t go in the other direction as well, Kalmbach said told Reuters Health by email. . “Some researchers have suggested that sleep-related hormonal changes can affect sexual response,” he said. “There could be some other neurobiological basis to this relationship that we have yet to identify.” . One critical issue left out of the study is time, said Dr. Louis F. Fabre of Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals in Houston, Texas, who was not part of the new study.  . “If the woman has more time to sleep does she have more time for sex too?” Fabre asked. . “I think getting less sleep because she was out on a date might produce different results than getting less sleep because she studied too late,” he said. . Fabre has published on associations between depression and sexual function in men. . The findings may have been similar for men as well, Kalmbach said.  . “There is no optimal amount of sleep for men or women,” he said. “Many people need somewhere between seven and nine hours, but there are plenty of people who do fine on less than seven, or more than nine.” . It’s hard to say whether women should change anything they are doing based on this study, he said.  . “However, good quality and sufficient sleep has been shown to be important for mood, health, and just about every other aspect of our daily lives,” he said. “It’s important to allow yourself sufficient opportunity to obtain adequate sleep.” .

Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - - People with Type 2 diabetes could trim down and improve their metabolic health by replacing long periods of sitting with periodic standing, taking the stairs or even just changing the television station manually, a new study suggests. . “It is important to stress that physical activity incorporates all different forms of movement and that people do not have to participate in structured exercise to be sufficiently active,” said Catherine Falconer, who led the study. . “Whatever you can do to increase the amount of physical activity you do and reduce the length of time sitting will have an impact on your diabetes and general health,” she wrote in an email. . Previous research has shown that increasing physical activity can help people with type 2 diabetes better handle their weight, glucose and lipid levels, Falconer and her team point out in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. But people with diabetes may have a particularly hard time staying active. . “Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with an obesogenic lifestyle, including low levels of physical activity. For some people with type 2 diabetes, mobility issues may prevent them from achieving sufficient physical activity, but for others it may be a result of behavior and environmental factors,” Falconer said. . Studies have also shown that people may have trouble increasing their activity level enough to actually improve their health and that long periods of just sitting may be particularly harmful. . So the researchers decided to examine the potential effect of replacing long periods of sedentary behavior with short interrupted periods, light exercise and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. . They looked at data on 519 adults with type 2 diabetes from a larger 2006-2008 study. The participants included in the new analysis wore accelerometers on their waists to measure their activity levels and also gave fasting blood samples to check their cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin and glucose levels.   . Researchers found the participants spent 65 percent of the waking day sedentary and 45 percent of that time was spent in long blocks of 30 minutes or more being inactive. The study team then used a statistical analysis technique to compare what might be the effects of replacing 30 minutes of one behavior with 30 minutes of another. . With just some interruptions in 30-minute sedentary blocks, the weight and waist circumference of subjects went down slightly, and fell even more when light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was swapped-in for the sedentary time. . When the researchers analyzed how much the adults’ metabolic health could improve with the different levels of activity, they found that HDL (“good”) cholesterol rose with light physical exercise, though not with more vigorous exercise. . “I think the message that we don’t even have to push for the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, that breaking up your sitting time has demonstrable benefits is actually pretty compelling,” said Dr. Eddie Phillips, who founded and directs the Joslin Diabetes Center’s  Institute of Lifestyle Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts.   . Phillips pointed out in a phone conversation with Reuters Health that the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggested 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic and “while there’s been an uptick . . . the majority of Americans don’t get that.” . “It is a valid criticism to say we have not convinced the public to walk more appreciably, and those recommendations will remain, but if we can now recommend to patients that, ‘Gees, if you just get up out of your chair when the commercial comes on or drink more water and have to go to the bathroom,’ even that is enough to break up the prolonged sedentary bouts they describe in the research,” said Phillips, who was not involved in the study. . Phillips said he made physical exercise a part of his regular discussions with diabetic patients, suggesting they increase their activity by even small increments. . “The discussion is usually about, ‘Could you walk a little more, a little faster, a little more frequently.  From there I would start asking what you like to do . . . get outside, be involved in a competition, do ballroom dancing?” he said. “The exact type of exercise is actually not that important and more to do with what you find enjoyable.” .

Susan Cornwell|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he was ready to sign bipartisan legislation to change the formula for reimbursing Medicare physicians, while the U.S. Senate’s top Democrat appeared open to allowing a vote on the measure. . Both developments signified growing support for a bipartisan effort to address a persistent problem and make small adjustments in Medicare costs. . But the timeline could slide as the Senate may be unable to act until after a two-week recess that will start this weekend. . “Congress is working to fix the Medicare physician payment system. I’ve got my pen ready to sign a good, bipartisan bill,” Obama, a Democrat, said at the White House, adding that this would be “really exciting.” . The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Thursday on the proposal negotiated by Republican Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. . Their proposal would replace the current Medicare doctor payment formula with one that has a stronger focus on quality of care, sparing doctors a 21 percent pay cut that they would otherwise face on April 1 under the existing payment formula, which is linked to economic growth. . The legislation includes some Medicare reforms sought by Republicans and a two-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for low-income children, sought by Democrats. White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the measure a “reasonable compromise.” . “And that’s why the president is supportive of this process in the House. He believes it should get careful consideration in the Senate,” Earnest told reporters. . While the bill is expected to pass the House, its path forward has been unclear in the Senate, where Democratic Leader Harry Reid and others in the minority party have expressed concern about anti-abortion language in the bill and their desire for four years, not two, of CHIP funding. . “Senator Reid may still vote against it, but he sees his role at this point as trying to facilitate a vote,” a Senate Democratic leadership aide told Reuters on Wednesday evening. . However, he said, the Senate might not act until after the two-week recess. He said Democrats were open to passing a temporary pay remedy meanwhile. . The proposal would add $141 billion to the U.S. deficit over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday. The overall cost is about $214 billion, but about $73 billion would be offset through savings in the bill, CBO said. |Wed Mar 25 20:35:43 +0000 2015||Obama ready to sign bipartisan fix for Medicare doctor payments |5.808304422759096e+17|http://reut.rs/1xzzOjX
Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) – - Sexually abused children whose mothers believe them and offer comfort are less likely to suffer from anger and depression, according to a recent study. . “Disclosing sexual abuse can be a very stressful process for a child, and the reactions of the child’s primary caregiver can play a key role in the child’s adjustment,” said lead author Kristyn Zajac, an assistant professor at the Family Services Research Center at the Medical University of South Carolina. . Nearly half of all sexual assault victims are under the age of 18, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. . According to previous studies, children who are abused are at risk of suicide attempts, running away and behavior problems, the researchers write in Child Abuse and Neglect. . Zajac and her colleagues recruited 118 pairs of children and mothers (or female guardians) from a child advocacy center. The children, who were between the ages of seven and 16, had been forensically evaluated to determine that physical abuse had occurred. None of the mothers was involved in the abuse. . The research staff interviewed each mother and child in separate rooms and asked them questions about the mother’s level of support including her tendency to doubt or blame the child, to reassure the child, to seek more information and to express a wish for revenge against the offender. . In addition, both mother and child answered questions about the child’s trauma-related emotional symptoms. . The researchers repeated the interviews nine months later, though about half of the mother-child pairs were unavailable for the second round. . Half of the perpetrators of sexual abuse were family members, about one in six were in a romantic relationship with the mother, and nearly one quarter were strangers. . Based on the first round of interviews, the study team found that children who rated their mothers as being more emotionally supportive showed lower levels of anger and depression.  . Children were more likely to act out with behavior problems – so called externalizing behavior -  if their mothers rated themselves as displaying more blame or doubt, but not when their mothers rated themselves as emotionally supportive.  . Children whose mothers expressed a desire for vengeance against the perpetrator were at greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder.  . Zajac noted in an email that the study was the first to specifically examine maternal behaviors - including expressing a desire for revenge or suggesting that the child was in some way responsible for the abuse - that had a negative effect on children’s adjustment. . Beverly Lovett, a professor of social work at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts, said that part of the reason mothers may react in an unsupportive way is that the abusers are so often people close to the family.  . Lovett, who was not involved in the study, noted that mothers may be financially or emotionally dependent on the offender, which can complicate the situation.  . “When a mother hears her son or daughter tell of being sexually abused, particularly by a known and trusted person, it often catapults her into crisis,” Lovett, said in an email. “Just as disclosure is a process for a child, mothers also may need time to digest the disclosure and respond in a way that does not doubt or otherwise fail to meet the child’s emotional needs,” she noted. . Zajac recommended seeking professional help for the children. For families without access to therapy or counseling, she recommends child advocacy centers, which may offer services to people with fewer resources. The National Children’s Advocacy Center website has a search page (. ) for finding a local child advocacy center. . Zajac also advised that the most helpful reaction mothers can have to the news of abuse is to provide comfort and reassurance and avoid expressing skepticism or a desire for vengeance. . SOURCE: .

|ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The three nations hardest hit by West Africa’s Ebola epidemic recorded the lowest weekly total of new cases so far this year in the week leading up to March 22, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.  . The figures are a further indication that the outbreak, which has killed more than 10,300 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is waning. But there are still worrying signs that the disease is not yet under control in Guinea, the U.N. health agency said in its weekly report. . Seventy-nine new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the three countries during the week. Forty-five of those were in Guinea. And in a minor setback, Liberia reported its first new case in three weeks. . The falling number of new cases in Sierra Leone and Liberia as well as a receding zone of transmission mean that treatment capacity now far exceeds demand there, and the WHO is working with local authorities to dismantle surplus centers. . Even Guinea, which has seen a rise in new cases in recent weeks, saw some improvement, with instances of new infections declining nationwide. However, the WHO cautioned that authorities had yet to pin down and isolate the sources of new cases. . “The fact that fewer than half of cases arose from known contacts, and the number of reported unsafe burials has increased suggests that the outbreak in Guinea continues to be driven by unknown chains of transmission,” it said. |Wed Mar 25 19:16:55 +0000 2015||New Ebola infections continue to drop, Guinea still a concern |5.80810613674369e+17|http://reut.rs/1xzpB79
|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amgen Inc will appeal the rejection of its bid to block the sale of Novartis AG’s biosimilar form of Neupogen, Amgen’s blockbuster drug used to prevent infections in cancer patients, according to a court filing on Wednesday. . The drug, Zarxio, contains the same active ingredient as Amgen’s $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, and once launched, would become the first biosimilar in the United States. A federal judge in San Francisco denied Amgen’s bid for an injunction last week. |Wed Mar 25 18:11:41 +0000 2015||Amgen to appeal rejection of bid to block Novartis biosimilar drug |5.807941951552963e+17|http://reut.rs/1HFvI9P
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Schools that use suspension to punish drug use, or that weakly enforce any of their drug policies, have higher rates of student marijuana use than schools with more consistent and less-punitive approaches, according to a new study. . “We hypothesized that harsh penalties like suspension would act as a deterrent and result in lower likelihood of marijuana use,” but that did not turn out to be the case, said lead author Tracy J. Evans-Whipp of the Center for Adolescent Health at Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Victoria, Australia.  . Other research has found that suspensions can be damaging for the individuals suspended, who might spend time away from school to mix with other antisocial groups, she said.  . But based on the new results, school suspensions might be damaging for the entire student body, she said. . “We suggest further research to follow this up – it could be that students in suspension-using schools feel that their school wouldn’t support them if they got into trouble,” Evans-Whipp told Reuters Health by email. . The researchers used two waves of surveys of more than 3,000 students in grades seven and nine and more than 100 of their school administrators, half in Washington State and half in Australia. In 2002, the students and administrators reported on their school drug policies. In 2003, the students reported their own drug use. . In Australia, 25 percent of school administrators said they would call the police in response to illicit drug use in the school and 56 percent said the student would receive out-of-school suspension, compared to 60 percent of Washington administrators who would call police and 78 percent who would use suspension. . About 40 percent of students in both locations cited suspension as an optional penalty for violating their school drug policy. . The researchers found that calling the police, expulsion and referral to a nurse or counselor were not associated with the likelihood of marijuana use among students.  . But out-of-school suspension policies and weak policy enforcement were tied to increased odds of marijuana use, according to the results in the American Journal of Public Health. . Underage marijuana use can lead to later dependence and is associated with a variety of health and behavioral problems such as memory deficits, psychosis, decreased levels of motivation, school non-completion, driving accidents and unsafe sexual practices, Evans-Whipp said. . Students who said their school policies included “abstinence education” about avoiding illicit drugs altogether, or whose schools counseled violators about the dangers of drug use were almost 50 percent less likely than others to use marijuana in the following year. . “There is a growing body of research in school and college settings that has found that harsh punishments are not necessarily linked to reduced problem behaviors and criminology researchers have similarly failed to find clear support for a link between deterrence effects and harsh punishments,” Evan-Whipp said.  . Controlled evaluations of different school policies toward cannabis would be helpful, said Wayne Hall, director of the Center for Youth Substance Abuse at the University of Queensland in Australia, who was not part of the study. . “I think we should try to find ways to keep students in school where possible e.g. by allowing them to remain if they submit to random urine screens and undergo some counseling to address any problems that may be generating cannabis use,” while continuing to send the message that drugs, alcohol and tobacco should be avoided during teen years, Hall told Reuters Health by email. . In-school suspensions should be encouraged, said David R. Bewley-Taylor of Swansea University in the U.K. . “That said, I would argue that appreciation of the complexities of teenage life within Australia and the USA is vital in understanding recreational drug use during this period in a young person’s life,” Bewley-Taylor told Reuters Health by email. . Some young people will use cannabis, so counseling them on how to do so with the least harm is preferable to disproportionate punishment, he said.  . “The findings of our study suggest that schools should strongly enforce a no-use policy through clear communication to students of expectations and consequences of rule violations and vigorous monitoring of school grounds,” Evans-Whipp said.  .

|(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s big-selling eye drug Eylea to treat diabetic retinopathy, the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in adults. . The Food and Drug Administration decision marked the fourth approval for Eylea, an injectable medicine that had sales of $2.78 billion in 2014. . “Today’s approval gives patients with diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema another therapy to treat this vision-impairing complication,” Edward Cox, director of the FDA’s Office of Antimicrobial Products, said in a statement. . The agency had previously approved Roche’s rival drug Lucentis for diabetic retinopathy, a condition in which blood vessels in the eye swell and leak fluid, or in which abnormal new blood vessels grow, hampering vision. . Regeneron shares were down 2.4 percent at $461.90 on the Nasdaq by 11:10 a.m. EDT (1510 GMT) on an off day for biotech stock indexes. . Eyelea was initially approved for wet age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. It is also approved for diabetic macular edema and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, all eyesight robbing conditions. .

Saliou Samb|CONAKRY/DAKAR (Reuters) - Guinea started testing an experimental Ebola vaccine from Merck and NewLink Genetics on affected communities this week, in a move officials hope will accelerate the end of an epidemic first detected a year ago. . But some worry about violent reactions from communities fearful about healthcare workers’ intentions in a country where resistance to the anti-Ebola campaign has been strongest. . The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has so far killed more than 10,200 people and, though now waning across the region, case numbers have increased in recent weeks in Guinea. . The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to vaccinate around 10,000 people over six to eight weeks. Health workers will immunize the high-risk contacts around Ebola patients, thereby creating a “ring of immunity” around them. . “Combined with control measures that we are putting in place with our partners, a safe and effective vaccine will allow us to close this trying chapter and start rebuilding our country,” said Sakoba Keita, national coordinator of the fight against Ebola in Guinea. . The vaccine has already been administered to some volunteer healthcare workers. [ID:nL5N0W7296] . The first team for this stage of the trial arrived in a village in western Guinea, one of the virus hotspots, on March 23 and received an “excellent response”, the WHO said. . Residents in Guinea have in the past attacked healthcare workers with stones and machetes amid rumors that they were plotting to contaminate them with the virus or that they had invented the disease as part of a plot to harvest their organs in Ebola treatment centers. . The vaccine administers a small diminished portion of the live virus in order to stimulate an immune reaction. This may trigger a fever, one of the early symptoms of Ebola. . “Someone arriving with a syringe in their hand might be taken as confirmation of all the rumors going around. It’s going to be very complicated,” said Jerome Mouton, Guinea country director for leading anti-Ebola charity Medicins Sans Frontieres. . The WHO said it would not force people to be vaccinated. . The Red Cross’s Africa director Alasan Senghore said overcoming resistance was the biggest challenge to ending the epidemic. “Realistically it will take towards the end of the year (to end Ebola),” he told Reuters.  . Trials for two other test vaccines began in Liberia in February and triggered some rumors in remote areas that these were a plot to contaminate locals with the virus.  |Wed Mar 25 15:20:42 +0000 2015||Guinea starts testing Merck vaccine in Ebola hotspots |5.807511661260759e+17|http://reut.rs/1xyLV0x
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Wednesday it was investigating Chinese-made laminates used by Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc, after reports that the company’s flooring products had too-high levels of formaldehyde. . Commission Chairman Elliot Kaye said the regulator would test flooring products from Lumber Liquidators to determine whether they contained levels of formaldehyde, a carcinogen, that could be harmful to human health.  . Kaye said the commission is “looking at months, unfortunately, not weeks” to determine the potential exposure, and he said it was too soon to tell whether the levels might warrant a possible recall of flooring products. . Lumber Liquidators said in a statement on Wednesday that it was cooperating with the safety commission and had turned over its own testing and safety information. . Formaldehyde is found in the glue that holds wood particles together in flooring boards. Laminate tops generally cover the boards and trap fumes released from the glue. . Lumber Liquidators came under fire after the CBS “60 Minutes” program claimed that laminates used by the company and made in China had unsafe levels of formaldehyde. . Kaye said the regulator’s probe was focused on Chinese-made laminates used by Lumber Liquidators for now, but the investigation could widen to other products or other companies if necessary. . Lumber Liquidators shares were up 7.8 percent to $31.08 Wednesday morning. |Wed Mar 25 14:44:47 +0000 2015||U.S. consumer safety regulators probes Lumber Liquidators laminates |5.807421255596114e+17|http://reut.rs/1xyEy9y
|LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron apologized on Wednesday to thousands of people who were infected with HIV and Hepatitis C after being treated for unrelated conditions with contaminated blood in the 1970s and 1980s. . Survivors and relatives of people who died after being infected through blood therapies or transfusions have campaigned for years for information about what happened, compensation and for anyone responsible for mistakes to be held accountable. . Many of those infected were hemophiliacs, or people who required blood transfusions in emergency situations. The blood treatments were provided by the state-run National Health Service (NHS). . Cameron was asked about the issue in parliament on Wednesday, at the same time as a public inquiry into HIV and Hepatitis C infections through NHS blood treatments in Scotland published its findings after seven years of work on the issue. . “It is difficult to imagine the feelings of unfairness that people must feel at being infected with Hepatitis C or HIV as a result of a totally unrelated treatment within the NHS,” Cameron told the House of Commons. . “To each and every one of those people I would like to say sorry on behalf of the government for something that should not have happened,” he said, adding that the government would provide up to 25 million pounds ($37 million) in 2015-16 to help transition to a better compensation system for those affected. . However, the report into contaminations in Scotland angered victims because it found that given the scientific knowledge that was available at the time, little could have been done differently to avoid infections. . The report ran to thousands of pages but made a single recommendation: that anyone who had a blood transfusion in Scotland before 1991 should be tested for Hepatitis C. . Local media reported there were cries of “whitewash” during the presentation of the report in Edinburgh. Bruce Norval, a hemophiliac who contracted Hepatitis C, told Sky News the report was “a travesty” and “obscene”. . “There were a large number of people there today who lost family members as many as 20, 30 years ago, children who were infected with AIDS who died as babies, fathers who never got to see their children grow up,” said Norval. . “What they expected today was some sign of responsibility from the state, and I’m not surprised they were upset and angered by what is a totally inadequate response to significant evidence of bad practice and negligence throughout the NHS.” . HIV and Hepatitis C infections through blood treatments occurred in several other countries during the 1970s and 80s. The report, commissioned by the devolved Scottish government,  said that when examined against what had occurred in other countries, NHS actions “held up well”. . The NHS position has always been that it acted in line with what was known at the time and staff had done their utmost to protect patient safety. |Wed Mar 25 13:59:49 +0000 2015||Britain's Cameron apologizes over infected blood in 70s, 80s |5.807308113574871e+17|http://reut.rs/1HDIl53
Mabvuto Banda|LILONGWE (Reuters) - The Global Fund has redirected $574 million in HIV/AIDS funding away from Malawi’s National Aids Council (NAC) after allegations of financial mismanagement, including the purchase of vehicles that were not budgeted for, it said on Wednesday. . Malawi’s Health Minister Jean Kalilani earlier told Reuters the fund had “pulled the plug” on the funding for the next two years because of the allegations. She said the Geneva-based fund had been misled by “unpatriotic Malawians”. . However, the Global Fund disputed this, saying it had decided earlier this year to channel the assistance, which runs until 2017, through Malawi’s Ministry of Health and the charity ActionAid rather than through the NAC, a public trust that is meant to spearhead the national response to HIV/Aids. . The fund said it had not considered cancelling AIDS funding to Malawi, one of the world’s worst-hit countries and home to more than one million children orphaned by the disease. . “At no time did the Global Fund discuss cancelling the $574 million allocation,” it said in a statement. “Every grant by the Global Fund is approved by the board and any cancellation has to be approved by the board.” . Greater access to medicine, backed by cash from the Global Fund, has helped slash AIDS-related deaths in Malawi, where HIV/Aids has been blamed for 59 percent of deaths among those aged  15 to 59 years in the landlocked southern African nation. . Malawi, a nation of 13 million people which depends on foreign aid for 40 percent of its national budget, has suffered after donors withheld funding over a major corruption scandal in 2013. . The Fund said Malawi had already repaid $3.3 million of improper spending unearthed by a 2012 audit, while an additional unspecified amount of “inadequately accounted funding” identified by donors was “still under discussion”. . Kalilani said the Fund had asked Malawi to repay a total of $6.4 million. She did not provide a breakdown. |Wed Mar 25 13:44:11 +0000 2015||Global Fund cancels $574 million for fighting AIDS in Malawi |5.807268755065487e+17|http://reut.rs/1HDCI79
Daniel Wallis|NEDERLAND, Colo. (Reuters) - Surrounded by tie-dyed T-shirts and marijuana pipes at her gift shop in the Colorado mountain town of Nederland, veteran pot activist Kathleen Chippi seems an unlikely candidate to have voted no when the state legalized recreational weed in 2012. . She says the measure was “fake” legalization because marijuana remains prohibited by federal law, and users, including medicinal pot patients and their caregiver, still risk having their lives ruined by prosecution and jail time. . But in what appears to be a largely symbolic move of her own, Chippi is now leading an effort to have Nederland, population about 1,500, declared the world’s first “sanctuary” for therapeutic and spiritual consumers of the drug. . Based on the “sanctuary city” laws that dozens of U.S. cities used to shield Central and Southern American refugees from deportation in the 1980s, the proposal is likely to go to residents for a vote in the fall. . “Just like with immigration policy, we need a place where people can be protected,” said Chippi, speaking in her shop near the foot of the snow-capped Indian Peaks Wilderness. . Protecting the spiritual use of cannabis is crucial for the 46-year-old, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Janis Joplin. Several years ago she founded the Closer to the Heart Cannabis Ministry, which she says has more than 300 members who believe marijuana is the Biblical Tree of Life, and that its use is a sacrament. . She opened Nederland’s first medical pot dispensary in 2009, and eventually had more than 2,400 patients, she said.  . But Chippi shut its doors the following year, angered by regulations passed by Colorado lawmakers that she viewed as a “violation of the constitutional rights of sick people.” She has since sued the state six times seeking changes in the rules and greater clarity for users and caregiver. At the same time, she began planning a “sanctuary” ordinance. . The proposal, drafted by Denver attorney Danyel Joffe, would prohibit the town from using funds to enforce any marijuana law affecting therapeutic or spiritual uses of cannabis, as long as its use harmed no one else. . “I wanted to help them because it’s my belief that cannabis is not an evil weed. There are people who use it for spiritual purposes,” Joffe said. “Yes, some people abuse it, but that doesn’t mean other people should be harmed as a result.” . Nederland, which began life in the 1850s as a trading post where European settlers could do business with local Ute Indians, later turned into a mining town. In more recent decades it became a draw for hippies and those attracted to its quirky, easy-going ambience. . This month the town hosted its annual Frozen Dead Guy Days festival, celebrating an effort by a Norwegian immigrant to preserve his grandfather’s corpse. The event features music, beer and events such as coffin races, a polar plunge and frozen salmon tossing. . Town Administrator Alisha Reis said the Nederland attorney’s office does not have an opinion on Chippi’s proposed ordinance yet because she has not formally submitted it. . “We are planning to process this initiative just like any other,” Reis told Reuters.  |Wed Mar 25 12:32:08 +0000 2015||Colorado pot campaigner seeks 'sanctuary' status for mountain town |5.807087451745116e+17|http://reut.rs/1HDbmhl
|JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli biopharmaceutical company BioLineRX Ltd said on Wednesday an early stage trial for a drug that uses stem cells to treat leukemia and other blood cancers met all safety and efficacy goals. . Current stem cell treatments require four or five days of injections of material from a donor to get into the bloodstream, but BioLineRX said its treatment, currently called BL-8040, needed just one. . “The results support BL-8040 as a one-day, single-dose collection regimen, which is a significant improvement upon the current standard of care,” the company said. . It noted it planned to present the full set of results from the Phase 1 study at a hematology conference in Vienna in June. . “The results exceeded our expectations, and validate BL-8040 as a highly differentiated stand-alone treatment for stem-cell collection,” said Kinneret Savitsky, BioLineRx’s chief executive.  . She said the company planned to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as soon as practicable to discuss the results of this study and obtain more clarity on the next steps in the clinical development program for this treatment. . In addition to stem-cell mobilization, the BL-8040 platform is also undergoing a Phase 2 study for treating relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients, results of which are expected in the second half of 2015, Savitsky said. . BioLineRX also expects to start clinical trials for three additional indications for BL-8040 in the second quarter of 2015. . Drugs normally have to pass three phases of testing in humans before being considered for approval by regulators. . Shares in BioLineRX were up 5.7 percent in early afternoon trade in Tel Aviv. Its Nasdaq-listed shares were 7 percent higher at $2.44 in pre-market trading. . In December, Swiss drugmaker Novartis bought a 12.8 percent stake in BioLineRX as part of a multi-year collaboration deal. |Wed Mar 25 12:14:18 +0000 2015||BioLineRX stem cell leukemia drug meets goals in early trial |5.807042579277087e+17|http://reut.rs/1HD56WQ
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Emergent BioSolutions Inc said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its treatment for inhaled anthrax, triggering a $7 million milestone payment from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). . The company developed the treatment, Anthrasil, as part of a $160 million contract it signed in 2005 with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the HHS.  . Anthrasil, which is approved in combination with other antibacterials, is already being stored in the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, the company said on Wednesday.  . The drug is made using plasma from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with Emergent Bio’s Anthrax vaccine, BioThrax, the only FDA-licensed vaccine for the disease. . Anthrasil has an orphan drug designation and qualifies for seven years of market exclusivity. . The treatment is a sterile solution that neutralizes toxins of Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium behind the infection. . The company is developing a vaccine that requires only two doses to confer immunity under a $31 million agreement with BARDA. BioThrax currently needs three doses. . The United States has witnessed a spate of anthrax scares. A bioterror lab mishap last June potentially exposed government workers to live anthrax at three labs in Atlanta. . Emergent Bio’s shares were down about 6 percent at $27.60. WBB Securities’ Stephen Brozak attributed the fall to investors buying on the rumor, and selling on the news. . Anthrax has been used as a weapon for nearly a century and is still considered one of the most likely agents to be used in biological warfare.  . Humans may contract the disease from livestock, wild animals, or animal products. Person-to-person transmission is highly unlikely, while signs and symptoms may change depending on how the disease is contracted. . Inhalation of bacterial spores, which occur naturally and can also be manufactured in a laboratory, is one of the deadliest ways to contract the disease.  . Once inhaled, it could take weeks after exposure before symptoms appear, potentially causing massive and irreversible tissue injury and death. . BARDA is funding other antianthrax drugs in development, including privately-held Elusys Therapeutics’ monoclonal antibody, Anthim. . With cases of infection few and far apart, the government is filling a gap that would not commercially be filled, Brozak said.   . “Bottom line is, if the United States wasn’t paying for this stuff, who would?”  |Wed Mar 25 12:14:18 +0000 2015||FDA approves Emergent BioSolutions' anthrax treatment |5.807042559605678e+17|http://reut.rs/1xydcAo
|(Reuters) - Israel-based VBL Therapeutics said a mid-stage study of its experimental brain cancer drug met the main goal of increasing overall survival. . The drug developer’s shares were up 20 percent at $6.70 in premarket trade on Wednesday. . The company said its drug, VBL-111, significantly improved overall survival when used in combination with Roche AG’s cancer treatment, Avastin. . The company said it stopped testing the drug as a monotherapy after the disease progressed in nearly half the patients in the study who were given only VBL-111. . VBL is also testing VBL-111 as a treatment for thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer. . The drug is the only one left in the company’s clinical pipeline after it stopped development of a second compound, VB-201, as a treatment for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. . Separately, the company said it expected to begin the only required late-stage study of VBL-111 by mid-2015, according to an agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . The FDA lifted a partial clinical hold on the late-stage study in February, six months after asking the company for more data on the drug’s potency. . VBL Therapeutics is the name Vascular Biogenics Ltd operates under. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had fallen nearly 7 percent since the company went public in September. |Wed Mar 25 11:42:29 +0000 2015||VBL Therapeutics brain cancer drug study meets main goal |5.806962487406264e+17|http://reut.rs/1HCTVNX
Nita Bhalla|NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Indian street-food seller Kumar Pal first began treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis two years ago, he quickly spiraled into depression and gave up hope of living. . Weighing just 35 kg (77 lbs), shunned by his relatives and friends and in extreme pain due to the side effects of a  cocktail of medicines, 40-year-old Pal spent weeks in bed. . “I stopped taking the medicines. I was certain that I was going to die anyway. I worried about how my wife would manage with four children,” said Pal, sitting in his two-roomed home in the maze of lanes in Sunder Nagari slum in northeast Delhi. . “The health visitors gave me support ... they used to tell me to take my medicines, do exercise, eat properly. It gave me hope for the future,” said Pal, who now weighs 55 kg and has recently been cleared of the disease. . Pal is one of hundreds of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients at St. Stephen’s Hospital in Delhi who have been cured, aided by a unique program providing psychosocial support to sufferers of one of the world’s most deadly diseases. . Despite a lot of progress over the past two decades, the bacterial lung disease TB, that is spread through coughs and sneezes, infected nine million people and killed 1.5 million in 2013, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . “One of the things overlooked when it comes to curbing tuberculosis is the mental health problems of patients,” said Joyce Vaghela, deputy director at St. Stephen’s Hospital’s Community Health Department. . “The long duration of the treatment which can be more than two years, the adverse side effects of all the drugs and the social shame attached to the disease can cause patients to suffer problems like depression, anxiety, anger or even feeling suicidal ... and they soon stop taking their medication.” . Vaghela said the hospital’s home care mental health program has treated over 400 patients with impressive preliminary success rates, proving that psychological support is crucial. . Studies by the hospital in 2011 found 5.7 percent of MDR-TB patients under the home care program quit treatment compared to the national average of 23 percent. The death rate under the program was 6.9 percent compared to the average of 23 percent. . Each year India has 2.2 million new cases of TB, more than 300, 000 deaths, and economic losses of $23 billion, prompting the nation’s president to call for greater efforts to curb its spread, especially with the emergence of MDR-TB, a form resistant to front-line drugs that is hard and costly to treat. . All cases of TB are hard to treat and require months of antibiotics. Symptoms include coughing, sometimes with sputum or blood, chest pains, weakness, weight loss and fever. . “TB is a major health problem which afflicts mainly the young and working population of our country. It is unfortunate that in India even today one person dies every two minutes due to this menacing disease,” President Pranab Mukherjee said in a statement this week to mark World Tuberculosis Day. . “There is urgent need to build public awareness about the curability and prevention of this disease.” . Under a revised government TB control program, patients must report to local TB centers six days a week to have their daily drugs administered but from the 19 million patients treated since 1993, only 3.4 million have been cured. . Experts say more than drugs are needed as patients often lack employment, nutrition, decent housing, and good healthcare. . “When TB is diagnosed, patients and their families must receive counseling, nutrition, and economic support,” Zarir Udwadia, consultant physician at the P.D. Hinduja National Hospital in Mumbai, wrote in the British Medical Journal. . In Sunder Nagari slum, home to some 70,000 people, TB is common but still brings with it stigma and shame. . Health workers report cases where patients are thrown out of their homes, sacked from jobs and ostracized by their community. . With no access to finance to support their families, a feeling of isolation and the harsh side effects of the drugs,  patients can develop mental health problems. . “While the system is focused on the patient taking their medicines, no one stops to ask them how they are feeling inside,” said Ravi Kumar Mishra, one of the eight home care health workers working in Sunder Nagari. . “Many of the patients are depressed and feel hopeless. But we encourage them to continue. It’s not easy but a relationship develops overtime and the patients learn to trust you and will phone regularly just to talk.” . Under the program which began in 2009, health workers fortnightly visit patients at their homes and advise and counsel them and their families about the disease and what to expect.  . Given the low incomes of many families, the hospital also provides supplies such as eggs and milk to patients who require a high protein diet and crèche services to help with day care. . In some cases, health visitors have also helped families gain access to government welfare schemes, soft loans and arranged skill development for family members of TB patients. . Doctors at St. Stephen’s Hospital, which gets funding from the charity United Way Worldwide, say the mental health home care program is effective and should be in the national TB program. . “Mental health is the invisible burden of TB,” said Vaghela. “Patients do not want to admit to having mental health issues and most doctors are too busy to deal with it. But if we want to end TB, we need to address this aspect of this disease.” |Wed Mar 25 00:20:07 +0000 2015||Indian doctors find success in tackling the 'invisible burden' of tuberculosis |5.805245282012365e+17|http://reut.rs/1xwDS4r
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - - Letting family members watch while doctors work to bring a loved one back from the brink of death may not hurt patients’ odds of survival, a new study suggests. . “Hospitals that have been hesitant to set policies that allow families to be in the room during resuscitation should be encouraged that this didn’t lead to worse outcomes or errors,” said Dr. Zachary Goldberger, the study’s lead author from the University of Washington Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. . “This is an important opportunity to enhance our end-of-life care for patients who are hospitalized,” he told Reuters Health. . The study examined cardiac arrest outcomes for 41,568 patients treated at 252 U.S. hospitals from January 2007 through September 2010. Of those, 80 hospitals that treated 13,470 patients had policies allowing families to observe resuscitation. . Overall, about 58 percent of patients had so-called spontaneous circulation restored, with a pulse returning for at least 20 minutes during the cardiac arrest, and roughly 18 percent survived until being discharged from the hospital, the authors reported in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. . Hospital policies on family presence during resuscitation had no impact on whether patients survived to leave the hospital. And, after adjusting for hospital characteristics and differences in the patients, the policies also had no effect on restoring circulation.  . The study is limited by its lack of data linking results for individual patients to whether their family members were present during resuscitation, Goldberger said. The study also lacks specific details about the policies in place at individual hospitals, making it hard to draw conclusions about which provisions might have the biggest impact on outcomes.  . “The study doesn’t show that family presence can effect outcomes, and more research is needed to fully understand the implications of this,” Goldberger said.  . Resuscitation procedures can be quite violent, and more research is needed on how watching them might impact families and patients who survive the incident, said Lisa Salberg, founder and chief executive of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association, a patient advocacy group. . “I think you are opening a Pandora’s box with this,” said Salberg, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Some families may want to see more and rather than sequester them it may make sense to let them in, but you are doing very aggressive things to their loved one – you are pounding on their chest and putting in IVs and maybe opening their chest – people may not want to see that.” . On the other hand, when there’s time to explain the procedures to families and prepare them for what they may see, allowing them to stay may provide a certain amount of comfort and closure, said Dr. Steven Simpson, head of critical care at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City. . At his last job, where a family presence policy was in place, it often provided closure for families without distracting doctors from the task at hand, said Simpson, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . Many times, when families saw exactly what was involved in resuscitation, they asked doctors to stop, bringing an early halt to a process that can often go on for 45 to 60 minutes, he said. . In the emergency department at his Kansas hospital, families are allowed to observe and, often, nurses are assigned to stay with them to make sure they understand what they’re seeing and help them cope with the way procedures may unfold, Simpson said. It’s an opportunity for family members to close the loop. . “If I see my loved one go down and there is a code blue and they usher me out and make me wait in the waiting room, and the next thing I know my loved one is dead, that leaves a gap that is hard to fill, like if you get a call out of the blue one afternoon that your son or daughter was killed in a car crash,” said Simpson. “I have never had a family member say I wish I hadn’t been there, and I have had numerous people say thanks.” .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) – - U.S. states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act have seen larger increases in diabetes cases than states that didn’t expand their programs, a new study shows. . The findings suggest that expanding Medicaid, the government-run health insurance for the poor, allows people with diabetes to be diagnosed earlier than before, which may improve outcomes later on, the researchers say. . “This is important because diabetes is becoming more prevalent as the population gets older,” said Dr. Harvey Kaufman, lead author of the study and senior medical director at Quest Diagnostics, which funded the analysis. . In the early stages of the disease, people can make lifestyle changes and get care that helps delay complications, he added. . If left untreated, diabetes can lead to vision loss, kidney failure, nerve problems and amputations of the legs and feet, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency says $176 billion is spent on diabetes and its complications each year. . Diabetes occurs when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . About one in nine adults has diabetes, according to the WHO. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the vast majority of cases and is linked to obesity and advanced age.  . Kaufman and colleagues focused their research on the hemoglobin A1c test, which measures the average blood sugar level for the past two or three months. . Using Quest Diagnostics’ database of lab tests, which includes about 150 million patient encounters annually, they counted how many people had at least one blood sugar test that was negative before Medicaid expansion and positive afterwards. . In January 2014, 26 states expanded access to Medicaid and 24 did not.  . Where more people got Medicaid, newly diagnosed diabetes cases among Medicaid recipients surged 23 percent, from 14,625 in the first six months of 2013 to 18,020 in the first six months of 2014. In states that didn’t expand Medicaid, diagnosis increased just 0.4 percent. . People are considered diabetic when their A1c level is at least 6.5 percent. Where Medicaid was expanded, the average A1c levels of newly diagnosed diabetes patients was 7.96 percent, compared with 8.14 percent in non-expansion states. . “It was apparent in the non-expansion states that you are making diagnosis at a later stage when they are presenting at the hospital with complications,” said Dr. Robert Ratner, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association.  . “The earlier you catch the disease, the easier it is to treat, and the more responsive it is and the more stable it can be,” said Ratner, who wasn’t involved in the study. . While more women in the study had diabetes, the increase in diagnosis was steeper for men. Gains were also greater for older people, aged 50 to 64, than for individuals aged 19 to 49. . The study had some limitations, including its reliance only on records from blood sugar tests done by Quest Diagnostics and its lack of clinical information. It’s also possible that some patients tested at Quest might have been diagnosed prior to the start of the study period. . Because it’s only based on tests at Quest, “you don’t know 100 percent if this was a new diagnosis, and not something the patient might have already known,” said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University. “But the overall study design makes a lot of sense.” . The number of newly diagnosed diabetes cases in the states where Medicaid expanded bodes well for the detection of other chronic health conditions which, like diabetes, may not immediately cause symptoms that are easy for patients to detect on their own, Sommers said. . “With the expanded coverage, you’re not going to diagnose more broken bones because whether or not they have insurance, when somebody breaks a leg they are going to get an x-ray,” said Sommers, who wasn’t involved in the study. “These findings with diabetes may be the tip of the iceberg, and you can imagine similar outcomes for earlier detection of high blood pressure, or cancer, or mental illness.” .

|(Reuters) - Drug developer Lpath Inc said its experimental drug to treat renal cell carcinoma, the most common form of kidney cancer, failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage trial. . Lpath shares were down 39 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. . Patients taking the drug, Asonep, did not show significant survival rates without the disease worsening. . To meet the goal, at least 25 out of 39 patients needed to be surviving without the disease spreading after two months of treatment, the company said. . Data from the trial suggested that the drug may produce disease stability for up to 20 months in some low-risk patients, Lpath said. . The company will look at exploring with a partner other opportunities where the drug may have “the best chance of success”. . Out of 11 serious adverse events reported by patients, one, associated with constipation, was deemed to be related to Asonep. |Tue Mar 24 20:30:35 +0000 2015||Lpath's kidney cancer drug fails mid-stage trial |5.804667614783406e+17|http://reut.rs/1HyzzFp
Carey Gillam|(Reuters) - Monsanto Co, maker of the world’s most widely used herbicide, Roundup, wants an international health organization to retract a report linking the chief ingredient in Roundup to cancer. . The company said on Tuesday that the report, issued on Friday by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), was biased and contradicts regulatory findings that the ingredient, glyphosate, is safe when used as labeled. . A working group of the IARC, based in Lyon, France, said after reviewing scientific literature it was classifying glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” . “We question the quality of the assessment,” Philip Miller, Monsanto vice president of global regulatory affairs, said on Tuesday in an interview. “The WHO has something to explain.” . Monsanto officials have asked to meet with WHO and IARC members, and Miller said the company wants a retraction. . A representative of the IARC could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. . Miller said the company provided scientific data to the IARC showing the safety of glyphosate, but that the agency largely ignored it.  . Miller said the IARC report should not affect the safety review of glyphosate currently under way by the Environmental Protection Agency. . The EPA, which has the power to limit or ban use of glyphosate, said it would look at the WHO report as part of the review process. . Farmers have been using glyphosate in increasing quantities since Monsanto in the mid-1990s introduced crops genetically engineered to withstand being sprayed with Roundup herbicide.  . “Roundup Ready” corn, soybeans and other crops are popular because of the ease with which farmers have been able to kill weeds. But weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate, leading farmers to use more herbicide. . The U.S. Geological Survey estimated agricultural use of glyphosate in 2012, the most recent year available, at more than 283 million pounds, up from 110 million pounds in 2002.  . The United States and other international regulatory bodies have backed the safety of glyphosate when used as directed, but the IARC report cited studies that raised concerns about glyphosate and impacts on health.  . Monsanto says such studies are invalid. But critics say they merit attention. . “There are a number of independent, published manuscripts that clearly indicate that glyphosate ... can promote cancer and tumor growth,” said Dave Schubert, head of the cellular neurobiology laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. “It should be banned.” |Tue Mar 24 19:43:05 +0000 2015||Monsanto seeks retraction for report linking herbicide to cancer |5.804548084375511e+17|http://reut.rs/1HyiWKe
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would hold a public hearing seeking information and comment on the use of products labeled ‘homeopathic’, as well as the agency’s regulatory framework for such products. . The hearing, scheduled for April 20-21, will discuss prescription drugs, biological products, and over-the-counter drugs labeled homeopathic, a market that has expanded to become a multimillion dollar industry in the United States. . The agency is set to evaluate its regulatory framework for homeopathic products after a quarter century. (. ) . An Australian government study released this month concluded that homeopathy does not work. (. ) . The FDA issued a warning earlier this month asking consumers not to rely on asthma products labeled homeopathic that are sold over the counter. (. ). . Homeopathic medicines include pellets placed under the tongue, tablets, liquids, ointments, sprays and creams. . The basic principles of homeopathy, formulated by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century, are based on a theory that a disease can be treated using small doses of natural substances that in a healthy person would produce symptoms of the disease. . The agenda for the hearing will be posted soon, the FDA said on Tuesday.  |Tue Mar 24 18:53:33 +0000 2015||FDA to evaluate homeopathy regulatory framework |5.804423426263204e+17|http://reut.rs/1xvAwyE
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Some cancer patients would like more information on the health risks of their radiology tests, a new study found. . Most of the 30 patients questioned for the study said they looked online for information about the radiation hazards of tests like computed tomography (CT) scans, since their doctors did not explain the risks. . “Before completing this study, I believed I understood what patients may wish to know and how to provide that information to them,” said Dr. Raymond Thornton, the study’s lead author from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.  . “As we analyzed nine hours of participants’ conversation, however, it became clear that a wide range of personal preference exists regarding what information is desired and the optimal way to transfer that information,” Thornton told Reuters Health by email. . Imaging techniques like X-rays, CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scans expose patients to ionizing radiation, which damages DNA and can lead to cell death or mutations that can increase the risk for later cancers.  . The benefits will almost always outweigh the risks when an imaging procedure is performed for an appropriate reason, Thornton said. . In cancer patients, “even negative or normal results add essential information to clinical care,” he said. . For the study, a trained specialist moderated small 90-minute focus groups in 2012, asking open-ended questions.  . Altogether, 30 patients with varied types and severities of cancer participated. They were a unique group, 80 percent white and 90 percent with a college degree, the authors write in the journal Radiology. . It may be that among the general population of U.S. cancer patients, knowledge and interest in this topic is different, the authors caution.  . Knowledge of which imaging methods involve ionizing radiation and which do not, and how these tests differ from the radiation used for cancer treatment, varied greatly between patients. . The participants were generally grateful for the benefits that the imaging tests provide but were concerned about the cumulative risks of having several scans. They would have liked their doctors to explain in more detail which tests were being ordered when, and their associated risks.  . Patients generally preferred to have these discussions with their personal physician and believed that the time constraints of office visits make that difficult. . “Our findings portray a gap between current practice and what patients say they want,” Thornton said.  . Creating scripts and educational tools for doctors who aren’t radiologists to facilitate discussions is one way to bridge that gap, he said. Written materials, including trusted Internet sources, that address patient concerns is another. . There is no mechanism in schools, government sources, healthcare establishments, or non-government organizations to teach people how to think about health risks or to assess their own risk, said Janet Busey of the radiation department at the University of Washington in Seattle. . “Although the individual radiation risks for diagnostic imaging scans are small, they need to be communicated to patients,” Busey, who wasn’t part of the new study, told Reuters Health by email. . “The ‘benefit vs. radiation-risk’ issues are generally different in terms of CT scans for patients who are (or were) being treated for cancer, as opposed to CT scans on individuals who do not have cancer,” said David J. Brenner of the radiation oncology department at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. . “For example, in many situations for cancer patients, long-term follow-up with CT scans is absolutely essential,” said Brenner, who was not part of the new study. “By contrast there are situations among non-cancer patients where there are options as to whether to do a CT scan or to do another type of exam.” . Doctor-patient communication issues in the study are likely common to both cancer and non-cancer patients, he noted. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Even though nine out of 10 nurses are women, men in the profession earn higher salaries, and the pay gap has remained constant over the past quarter century, a study finds. . The typical salary gap has consistently been about $5,000 even after adjusting for factors such as experience, education, work hours, clinical specialty, and marital and parental status, according to a report in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. . “Nursing is the largest female dominated profession so you would think that if any profession could have women achieve equal pay, it would be nursing,” said lead study author Ulrike Muench from the University of California, San Francisco.  . Muench and colleagues used two large U.S. data sets to examine earnings over time. One, the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, provided responses from nearly 88,000 participants from 1988 to 2008. The other, the American Community Survey, offered responses from nearly 206,000 registered nurses from 2001 to 2013. . Every year, each of the data sets found men earned more than women; the unadjusted pay gap ranged from $10,243 to $11,306 in one survey and from $9,163 to $9,961 in the other. . There was a gap for hospital nurses, $3,783, and an even bigger one, $7,678, for nurses in outpatient settings.  . Men out-earned women in every specialty except orthopedics, with the gap ranging from $3,792 in chronic care to $17,290 for nurse anesthetists.  . While the study didn’t address the reasons for persistent gaps in pay, it’s possible that men are better at negotiating raises and promotions or that they are less likely than women to take extended breaks from the labor force to care for young children or aging parents, said Patricia Davidson, dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland. . Many women are drawn to nursing at least in part by the flexibility, noted Davidson, who wasn’t involved in the study. With shift work and opportunities to advance while working nontraditional hours, nursing should be far better suited to balancing a career and family obligations than many other professions, she told Reuters Health. . “It’s a real indictment that this issue of gender disparity is prevalent in nursing where it’s predominantly female,” said Davidson. “In Wall Street or Silicon Valley people can dismiss it because it’s a culture that’s not known to be accommodating – a male-dominated work environment where it’s stacked against them – but when you see this inequity in nursing it speaks to a larger problem.” . It’s also possible that the study exposed a gender difference in career choices, rather than a genuine lack of equal pay for equal work, said Linda Aiken, a nursing and health policy researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.  . “Men may be more likely to work full time and even to work more hours per week than other full time nurses,” Aiken, who wasn’t involved in the study, said in an email interview. The study findings require “more analysis before we can conclude that there is an actual gender gap in pay for equal work and how a gender gap might best be addressed.” . In nursing, pay equity also involves more than issues of gender, Aiken said. For example, she noted that Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly, pays nurse practitioners working in primary care 85 percent of the rates physicians are paid for the same services. And primary care providers are paid less than clinicians in subspecialties like anesthesia. . “If the observed gender gap in nurses’ incomes is a product of female nurses being more likely to elect specialties that are in great need like primary care, long-term care, home care, and public health, it would not be in the public’s interest to encourage more women to follow in the footsteps of men to elect higher paying specialties or practice settings,” Aiken said. . The study provides enough data over enough time to show that the pay gap isn’t random, Muench said. “My hope is that this raises awareness and can start a discussion about what additional steps could be taken to achieve equal pay.” .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Survey data from 2001 to 2010 show that lack of insurance kept some people with hepatitis C virus from getting treatment. . Recently, more effective and well-tolerated drugs have been developed to treat hepatitis C, removing many of the discouraging side effects of older drugs. The infection is curable and transmission can be prevented, researchers write in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.  . But for the more than three million people in the U.S. who have chronic liver disease from hepatitis C, there are still two important barriers to getting treatment, said lead author Dr. Ivo Ditah from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. . First, many people with the disease do not know they have it, because they feel no symptoms. Once they’ve been screened and tested positive, those without health insurance or with poor health insurance likely cannot afford the $250,000 to $350,000 price tag for medications and facility fees, Ditah said. . For the new study, he and his coauthors used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, which includes blood testing for infections like hep C, from 2001 to 2010. . Of 38,025 people sampled, 502 tested positive for hep C and 205 were available six months later for follow-up testing. The rest, who tended to be less educated, injecting drugs or not have health insurance, could not be reached. . Half of those 205 patients said they were not aware of their infection until the surveys were done, and 166 pursued further testing or evaluation, but only 18 received therapy. Lack of health insurance coverage was the only predicting factor for who would not receive treatment. . “I think the message remains very strong that a lack of health insurance is going to be a major stumbling block,” Ditah told Reuters Health by phone. “We see a lot of denials from insurance companies not to cover these medications. It’s a huge problem.” . Hep C can be spread by sharing needles, being born to a mother who has the infection, and less commonly through sexual contact. Until the early 1990s, it could also be spread by blood transfusions, but now blood banks can test for the virus in stored blood. . Chronic liver infection can result in long-term health problems, including liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer, or even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hepatitis C is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the U.S. . Up to 25 percent of people who get chronic hepatitis C will clear the virus on their own, while the rest require treatment, according to the CDC. . As newer versions of the best treatments are developed, those in use now will gradually become less expensive, and insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act has expanded since 2010, Ditah said. . As more people get health insurance, the proportion of people with the infection who cannot be reached will continue to go down, he said.  . The CDC recommends that all people of the “baby boomer” generation, born between 1945 and 1965, be screened for hepatitis C. . “Those recommendations should be followed. If they are found to have the infection then a good chunk will get treatment,” unless they don’t have good health insurance, Ditah said. . SOURCE: .

Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - An experimental drug that caused appalling side effects in a clinical trial nine years ago is back in tests for rheumatoid arthritis and is showing promise when given at a fraction of the original dose. . The small German-Russian biotech firm which now owns the drug hopes to confirm its benefits in a mid-stage trial, starting in June, and then bring in a major pharmaceutical company as a strategic investor, its chief executive told Reuters. . It is a remarkable turnaround from March 2006, when six healthy volunteers given the drug in London ended up in intensive care. One of them was described as looking like “the elephant man” after his head ballooned. Another lost his fingertips and toes. . The disaster led to the collapse of Germany’s TeGenero, the initial developer of the medicine known as TGN1412. . Since then, however, scientists have developed a way to study the effects of the drug on human cells in a test tube, allowing the rational calculation of a safe starting dose. . That has provided a way back into clinical testing for TheraMAB LLC, a start-up company operating in Germany and Russia, backed by Moscow-based fund Bioprocess Capital Ventures, which bought the rights to TGN1412 and renamed it TAB08. . According to an editorial to be published in the next edition of the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, TAB08’s “potentially triumphant return” shows that high-risk medicines can be tested safely in humans if researchers have detailed insight into how they work. . “In the course of this disaster a couple of people almost died, the company (TeGenero) went under and investors lost their money,” journal editor Adam Cohen of Leiden University told Reuters. “None of that should have happened.” . There is a still a long way to go and the drug may yet fail in later-stage studies or prove uncompetitive against existing treatments.  . But if successful, its comeback could echo the story of thalidomide, which caused birth defects when it was launched half a century ago as a treatment for morning sickness in pregnancy and has now been repurposed as a treatment for blood cancer. . TheraMAB Chief Executive Dmitry Tyrsin said in an interview he had already discussed the project with more than 20 potential “big pharma” partners, though any deal would depend on results from the upcoming mid-stage Phase IIa trial, involving 120 to 150 patients. . That trial has regulatory approval to start in Russia in June and Tyrsin hopes to get approval to extend it to the United States later this year. Further off, he aims to test TAB08 in two more autoimmune diseases, lupus and psoriasis. . TAB08 is a so-called CD28 superagonist which works by activating components of the immune system called regulatory T cells, rather than blocking the system as happens with existing antibody drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. . That brings a risk of over-stimulation, which is what happened in the London trial in 2006 when scientists failed to realize that successful tests on cynomolgus monkeys were not relevant for humans because of subtle immune system differences. . Now, armed with results from the new lab test, TheraMAB is using doses that are 10 to 20 times less than in the London study. It has found early signs of long-lasting benefit in reducing arthritis symptoms in small initial Phase I tests in people, with no serious side effects. . In the high-risk biotech industry, the odds of translating such early success into a commercial product remain low, but Tyrsin believes the resurrection of TAB08 has wider implications. . “This is good news for the whole industry,” he said. “It shows that if you plan pre-clinical development in the right step-wise way, then you can safely develop potentially risky drugs.” . CD28 superagonists are also being investigated by a number of academic groups in Europe and Asia for various inflammatory conditions, as well as stroke and heart disease. None of these programs has yet been tested in humans. |Tue Mar 24 15:17:45 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Drug that caused 'elephant man' side effect makes comeback after 2006 disaster |5.803880342664315e+17|http://reut.rs/1HwM848

|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Humana Inc, one of the largest U.S. providers of Medicare Advantage healthcare plans for older people, said on Tuesday that it believes a previously disclosed government query for information is part of a wider review involving many healthcare companies. . Humana first said the U.S. Department of Justice had asked it to volunteer information about risk adjustment matters on Feb. 18. . “Humana believes that this request for information is in connection with a wider review of Medicare risk adjustment generally that includes a number of Medicare Advantage plans, providers and vendors,” the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. . The disclosure came the morning after DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc said in a regulatory filing that its JSA Medical Group unit had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General. JSA provides medical services through clinics and pharmacies. . DaVita said it had been advised by a Justice Department lawyer that the subpoena related to a civil investigation of Humana and its service providers’ risk adjustment practices and data including patient diagnoses. . DaVita said the time period involved was from 2008 through 2013 and that the subpoena related in particular to two Florida physicians that had previously contracted with it. . The government makes risk adjustment payments to Humana and other companies that provide Medicare Advantage when they have patients who are sicker than average.  . “As matter of policy, the department generally neither confirms nor denies the existence of an investigation,” Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said. . Susquehanna analyst Chris Rigg said in a research note that the Humana disclosure fit with the DaVita request and a notice to insurers from a Health and Human Services division earlier this year about its review of the use of patient in-home risk assessments by insurers. . Humana shares were up 0.4 percent at $182.77 in morning trading. DaVita was down 0.6 percent at $82.32. |Tue Mar 24 14:19:14 +0000 2015||Humana says previously disclosed DOJ query involves other companies |5.80373308908159e+17|http://reut.rs/1HwrNvT
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday that it would stop a large study of its Keytruda melanoma treatment early because an independent monitoring committee determined the drug succeeded in its goal of prolonging survival in previously untreated patients at advanced stage of the disease. . The medicine, a PD-1 inhibitor that works by taking the brakes off the immune system, is already approved to treat patients who have failed to benefit from standard treatments, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Yervoy. . Patients taking Keytruda showed meaningful improvement in overall survival and in delayed progression of disease, compared with those taking Yervoy, Merck said. . The data, if regulators agree, could allow Merck to widen its marketing of Keytruda to people being treated for the first time for the dangerous skin disease. . Shares of Merck were up 1 percent at $59.30 in early trading.         . “Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate a survival advantage compared to the standard of care for the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma,” Merck said in a release. It noted that data from the study will be presented at a medical meeting next month in Philadelphia. . About 76,000 Americans are diagnosed every year with melanoma, which is highly linked to sun exposure, and more than 9,700 die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. . Merck said safety of Keytruda in the halted study was similar to that seen in earlier trials, where the most common side effects were fatigue, coughing, nausea and other mostly mild reactions. . Keytruda in September became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved by U.S. regulators. Three months later, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo, also for patients with advanced melanoma who no longer respond to other drugs. It also works by blocking the PD-1 protein. . AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers are also developing PD-1 inhibitors, or similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors. Wall Street expects the products to generate combined annual sales of more than $30 billion by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative potential use.    . Merck aims by midyear to seek U.S. approval of Keytruda for non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. . Bristol-Myers in January said it was halting a trial of Opdivo for lung cancer, also at the advice of independent monitors, when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy. |Tue Mar 24 13:15:59 +0000 2015||Study of Merck melanoma drug halted after survival prolonged |5.803573908114309e+17|http://reut.rs/1xuDljA

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Britain issued new guidance on Tuesday for doctors treating severely or terminally ill children, strongly advising that children’s own views on whether they want to live or die should be taken into account. . The guidelines, from Britain’s Royal College of Paediatrics and Child health, will be watched carefully around the world, experts said, since Britain is one of the few countries to have a framework to help doctors decide if and when to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a child. . “This is not an easy area of medicine. Sadly we can’t save every child’s life,” said Joe Brierley, a pediatric and neonatal intensive care consultant at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital. “Other countries are listening to what we’re saying and following what we’re doing.” . The guidance, drawn up by doctors, lawyers and medical ethicists, advises for the first time that sick children as young as nine who have little hope of a fulfilling life should be given more say about whether their treatment should stop. . A child who has had many chemotherapy sessions, or a bone marrow or organ transplant that has not gone well “will have more informed views about continuing treatment than an adult facing such treatment for the first time”, the advice says. . Vi Larcher, a former consultant in pediatrics and ethics, and co-author of the guidance, said it sought to address “an underlying concern that we’re doing too much for too many for too long”.     . Advances in medicine mean more and more babies are being born very prematurely — and some born as early as 22 weeks gestation are able to survive. Older children with conditions such as severe head injuries also have better survival chances thanks to medical progress. . Yet the guidelines urge doctors to consider carefully whether continuing treatment is always the right thing for a very sick child. . “For some, continuing life-sustaining treatment is simply prolonging suffering in the face of the inevitable,” said Simon Newell, a neonatal consultant at Britain’s Leeds General Infirmary.  . “For (some) babies, no treatment is going to cure them and their quality of life is non-existent,” he told a briefing. . Previous guidance suggested that doctors should not resuscitate or give intensive care to premature babies born at 22 weeks gestation or less, and should only attempt treatment in babies born at 22 to 23 weeks if parents and other carers agree.   |Tue Mar 24 11:41:21 +0000 2015||Views of terminally-ill children should be heard: new UK guidelines |5.803335751925801e+17|http://reut.rs/1HvH1RC
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - People eager to share personal information beyond what’s on their Facebook profile have another outlet: an online platform launching on Tuesday will let them give scientists information about their genomes, gut bacteria and other biological data. . The “Open Humans Network” aims to make more health-related data available for scientists to mine for discoveries and also help volunteers make that data more accessible to more researchers. Rather than volunteering for only a single study, participants would let any legitimate researcher use their data, even though that poses potential threats to privacy. . “It’s like open-sourcing your body,” said project director Jason Bobe. . Open Humans is launching when scientists are increasingly concerned that valuable genetic and other data are being kept under wraps. Academic researchers do not want to give competitors access for fear they will be scooped on new discoveries, and gene-testing companies keep data private so they can profit from it, said geneticist George Church of Harvard University. . “Data hoarders range from two-person labs to large companies,” he said. . Open Humans seeks to counter that. . At www.openhumans.org, people can sign up for one or more of (so far) three ongoing studies. . American Gut investigates links between gut bacteria and disease. GoViral identifies what viruses are circulating in different areas of the United States during flu season. The Personal Genome Project, led by Harvard’s Church, has collected full genome sequences on about 500 of its 4,100 volunteers in an effort to study associations between DNA variants and health. . By joining a study, people agree that their data can be shared with researchers on other projects, with their names attached so scientists can contact them for follow-up, something not possible with “de-identified” biological data. . “You become a richer resource if your data are shared among as many scientists as possible,” Bobe said. “Maybe someone will find an association between your gut microbiome and your susceptibility to the flu. Any participating researcher will be able to log in and look through the genomic and other data” of Open Humans volunteers. . Participants will have to pass a test demonstrating they understand the potential risks of sharing their genetic profile and health history, including that it might be hacked, something that could expose them to discrimination in life insurance or long-term care coverage. . Open Humans is backed by $500,000 grants from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. |Tue Mar 24 06:23:58 +0000 2015||Online platform 'Open Humans' launches to share DNA, other data |5.802537066392863e+17|http://reut.rs/1HuwztK
Astrid Zweynert|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Over the next 35 years, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis will kill 75 million people and could cost the global economy a cumulative $16.7 trillion - the equivalent of the European Union’s annual output, a UK parliamentary group said on Tuesday. . If left untackled, the spread of drug-resistant TB superbugs threatens to shrink the world economy by 0.63 percent annually, the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Tuberculosis (APPG TB) said, urging governments to do more to improve research and cooperation. . “The rising global burden of multidrug-resistant TB and other drug-resistant infections will come at a human and economic cost which the global community simply cannot afford to ignore”, economist Jim O’Neill said in a statement. . O’Neill, a former chief at investment bank Goldman Sachs, was appointed last year by British Prime Minister David Cameron to head a review into antimicrobial resistance. . The bacteria that cause TB can develop resistance to drugs used to cure the disease. Multidrug-resistant TB fails to respond to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . The UK parliamentary group’s cost projections are based on a scenario in which an additional 40 percent of all TB cases are resistant to first-line drugs, leading to a doubling of the infection rate. . The WHO said last year multidrug-resistant TB was at “crisis levels”, with about 480,000 new cases in 2013. . It is a manmade problem caused by regular TB patients given the wrong medicines or doses, or failing to complete their treatment, which is highly toxic and can take up two years. . The group urged governments to set up a research and development fund, target investments into basic research and increase support for bilateral TB programs. . “We need better tools to deal with this new threat, but since TB primarily affects the poorest and most vulnerable in society, there is little commercial incentive to develop new drugs,” said Nick Herbert, co-chairman of the APPG TB. . The fight against TB, the world’s second deadliest infectious disease after HIV, is also hampered by a lack of an effective vaccine, the APPG TB said. . The only TB vaccine, BCG, protects some children from severe forms of TB - including one that affects the brain - but is unreliable in preventing TB in the lung, which is the most common form of the disease. . TB, which spreads through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person, killed 1.5 million people worldwide in 2013, according to the WHO. |Tue Mar 24 00:14:57 +0000 2015||Drug-resistant TB threatens to kill 75 million people by 2050, cost $16.7 trillion |5.801608396903711e+17|http://reut.rs/1xsMIjK
Astrid Zweynert|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than half a million children who fall ill with tuberculosis each year are at risk of dying because of a lack of child-friendly treatments, experts said.      . Tuberculosis, which kills more than one person every 20 seconds, is much harder to detect in children than in adults because they do not always show the typical symptoms, such as coughing, night sweats and blood in the phlegm or spit. . As a result, health workers tend to focus on treating adults displaying symptoms of the potentially deadly air-borne disease, experts said. But, if left untreated, children with TB become ill and die much faster than adults.      . “A huge number of children are suffering and dying from TB because the majority of efforts to fight the disease have focused on adults, so children with TB have become invisible,” said Mercedes Becerra, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, United States.    . “And even if they get treatment, we lack reliable diagnostic tools and child-friendly medicines, which hinders effective treatment and can even fuel drug resistance,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. . TB, which kills at least 80,000 children each year, is a contagious bacterial lung illness that spreads via the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.     . It is hard to treat, requiring months of antibiotic treatment, and drug resistant strains are rapidly gaining a foothold.     . Five years ago the WHO recommended new and more appropriate doses for childhood TB but pills for children have yet to be manufactured. . Instead, doctors and parents have to crush or split adult pills, which often leads to the wrong doses, potentially fuelling a growing number of drug-resistant cases that no longer respond to the most commonly used treatments for TB, experts said. . As many as 32,000 children become sick with multi-drug resistant strain of TB (MDR-TB) each year, according to a study last year co-authored by Becerra, forcing them to take a daily cocktail of drugs with heavy side effects for up to two years. . “Even if children get ill with MDR-TB, they respond well if they get treatment,” said Becerra. “(Not treating them) is a huge missed opportunity - if you treat them, you can cure them.” . Shelly Malhotra, director of market access at the TB Alliance, said progress in creating child-friendly TB drugs had been slow but that three pharmaceutical companies were currently seeking approval from the WHO to produce such formulations. . The New York-based TB Alliance, which is dedicated to the discovery and development of new, faster-acting and affordable TB medicines, is hoping to make them available through its Global Drug Facility in the second half of this year, she said. . The lack of child-friendly formulations is part of a wider malaise in finding new TB drugs, an issue that has become more pressing due to drug resistance. . Even though TB is the world’s second largest infectious disease, there have been no new drugs for almost 50 years and new ones developed recently are still undergoing trials. . Manufacturers have been slow to respond to the challenge of finding child-friendly TB drugs partly because a lack of accurate data makes it hard for them to gauge the size of their potential market, Malhotra said. . “There is a lack of accurate data in many countries, in particular where there is a large private treatment sector, so we don’t get good data from villages, from the private providers, or even hospitals,” Malhotra told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . Every childhood TB case should be registered with the national TB control program, including crucial data such as age, HIV status and treatment outcome, she said. . Becerra urged governments and donors to provide more funding so that health workers could get better training to make sure they do not miss children with TB.      . Simple steps, such as making sure that children of TB patients are tested for the disease, can go a long way to improve the situation, said Becerra. . “TB is a family disease, a social disease, so that’s where it needs to be tackled - at the household level through contact-tracing,” she said.  . “It’s a fundamental part of what Europe and the U.S. have done for a long time but it’s still not done consistently in the developing world due to lack of resources.”    |Tue Mar 24 00:14:57 +0000 2015||Children with TB at risk of dying amid slow progress on child-friendly treatment |5.801608378281124e+17|http://reut.rs/1Htets1
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – - Taking people off cholesterol-lowering medications near the end of life is safe and may actually be beneficial, according to a new study. . Among people without active heart disease who were expected to live no more than a year, stopping the drugs, known as statins, didn’t increase the number of deaths within 60 days, but did improve quality of life. Stopping the drugs also reduced costs. . “We start a lot of medicines, and many of these medicines come with the tagline that ‘you’ll be taking these medicines for the rest of your life,’” said Dr. Amy Abernethy, the study’s senior author from the Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. . “They start to stack up, but we don’t have a thoughtful way to stop them,” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. . Statins work by blocking a substance the body needs to make cholesterol, which can build up in arteries and ultimately cause heart attacks and strokes. Popular statins include Pfizer’s Lipitor, sold generically as atorvastin, and Merck’s Zocor, sold generically as simvastatin. . The researchers write in JAMA Internal Medicine that drug trials rarely address the issue of when to stop using the treatments. The topic becomes especially important as the body responds differently to drugs later in life. . Statins are considered candidates for so-called deprescribing at the end of life, because their benefit - a lower risk of heart disease - isn’t seen for about two years, they write. . The researchers recruited 381 people who were not expected to live for more than a year. Their average age was 74, and  they’d been taking statins for at least three months. They did not have active heart disease. About a fifth were cognitively impaired and about half had cancer. . About half the participants were randomly assigned to stop taking statins. Overall, about 24 percent died within 60 days, but that was not significantly different from the 20 percent who died in the group that kept taking the drugs. . The group that stopped taking the drugs did have a small improvement in their quality of life scores, compared to those who continued to take the medications, the researchers found. . Abernethy said they can’t say why quality of life scores increased, but it could be because patients interpreted the discussions surrounding deprescribing medications as doctors paying more attention to their healthcare needs. . She said stopping statins was also linked to stopping other medications per doctors’ instructions, which may occur when doctors find that it’s safe to stop certain drugs. It may also be that drugs to control statin side effects were no longer needed. . They also found that stopping statins among people who were close to death saved about $4 per day, or about $716 per patient. . “We hope the way the data will be used is a part of doctors being able to have more confident conversations between patients and families,” Abernethy said. . While it’s typically difficult to draw conclusions when looking for deaths among a group of people, Dr. Andrew E. Moran from Columbia University Medical Center said it’s appropriate for this trial. . “Because the survival is so poor in these very ill people, it’s not unreasonable to recruit a fairly small sample size because the probability of adverse events and death is very high in these patients,” said Moran, who was not involved with the new study.    . He also said that doctors typically consider people’s life expectancy and possible benefits when deciding whether to continue treating them with statins. . For some doctors, pharmacists and even patients and their families, the new evidence may show it’s OK to discontinue some therapies at the end of life. . “I think it’s not just for physicians but patients and family members,” Moran said. . Researchers suggest a five-step plan for evaluating and deprescribing medications in an article also published in JAMA Internal Medicine. . The five-step plan includes finding all the medications a person is taking, considering the risk of taking the drugs, evaluating the possibility of discontinuing each drug, prioritize which drugs to stop and then stopping medications while monitoring the patient. . More research is needed to determine which patients would benefit most from having some of their medications stopped, write the authors, led by Dr. Ian Scott from the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. . In a commentary, Dr. Holly Holmes of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Adam Todd from the Durham University in England say similar research should be done on preventive treatments for diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic conditions. .

Yasmeen Abutaleb|(Reuters) - Government-funded clinical trials are under way of an improved anthrax vaccine requiring fewer doses and that has the potential to boost immunity faster, top health officials said on Monday.  . The Department of Health and Human Services said it signed a 30 month, $31 million agreement with Maryland-based Emergent Biosolutions Inc to develop a vaccine that would require only two doses to confer immunity. Emergent currently has a Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine called BioThrax that requires three doses.  . Emergent’s improved vaccine, called NuThrax, is an updated version of BioThrax, which has been stockpiled by the  government to protect against potential bioterrorism attacks.  . Research and early development of Nuthrax was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, which enabled it to complete early Phase I and II clinical studies. HHS will fund Phase III trials, which means the vaccine will be tested on a larger group of people to determine its efficacy and safety.  . Emergent’s anthrax vaccine has been used for more than a decade, but has stirred controversy. Military members complained about its side effects and Congress questioned its efficacy, noting the dosing schedule would take too long in the event of a biological attack.   . The vaccine’s development comes under the U.S. biodefense program, which aims to develop drugs and vaccines to protect against potential bioterror threats and public health emergencies. . “Anthrax remains a national health security threat, and we’re striving to develop an anthrax vaccine that affords immunity sooner and with fewer doses,” Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), an agency under HHS, said in a statement.  . HHS began seeking improved vaccines after letters laced with anthrax were mailed to media outlets and U.S. senators in 2001,  killing five people and infecting 17.      |Mon Mar 23 23:11:52 +0000 2015||U.S. funding research of better anthrax vaccine: health officials |5.801449620770693e+17|http://reut.rs/1HsZyhB
Susan Cornwell|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Early evidence suggests that the tax credit subsidies at the core of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law likely helped expand U.S. health insurance coverage last year, Congress’s non-partisan research arm said on Monday. . The subsidies - which can be paid by the federal government to insurers in advance to lower monthly insurance premiums - significantly reduced the premium costs, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a report.     . “Surveys GAO identified estimated that the uninsured rate declined significantly among households with incomes eligible for the APTC (Advanced Premium Tax Credit),” the GAO said. . For example, one survey, conducted by Washington, D.C.’s Urban Institute, found the uninsured rate declined 5.2 percent between September 2013 and September 2014 among those eligible for the tax credit subsidies, the report said. . The GAO also said its findings on the first year of the Obamacare insurance exchanges could not be generalized to future years because other factors, including health care costs, could affect the affordability of insurance going forward. . The subsidies - aimed at making insurance more affordable for low-income people under Obama’s Affordable Care Act - are being challenged in a Supreme Court case, King v. Burwell. . In a ruling expected in June, the high court could bar the federally run insurance marketplace from providing the subsidies in at least 34 states. . The plaintiffs contend the Affordable Care Act allows subsidies to be distributed only through state-based exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia set up their own exchanges from October 2013. . The subsidies are available to people making between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. They can reduce insurance premiums dramatically - cutting them by 76 percent on average for people who picked an insurance plan on the federal exchange or on one of two state-based plans, the GAO said. . Nearly 11.7 million people have either signed up or re-enrolled for insurance coverage under the U.S. healthcare reform law. The GAO said about 16 percent of non-elderly adults remain uninsured. |Mon Mar 23 22:38:11 +0000 2015||Obamacare subsidies likely expanded insurance coverage: report |5.80136487976616e+17|http://reut.rs/1HsR2z7
Randi Belisomo|WASHINGTON, D.C. (Reuters Health) - - Physician incentives are needed to improve end of life care in the U.S., health experts said Friday at an Institute of Medicine (IOM) forum. . The forum convened at the National Academy of Sciences to discuss action on the recommendations of the IOM’s seminal fall report, Dying in America. . “Our current system is not equipped to deal with these challenges,” said IOM President Victor Dzau, citing a rising number of elderly with multiple chronic illnesses, too few palliative care services to keep pace with demand, and time pressures that keep providers from having conversations with patients about end of life preferences and values.  . “We need to make sure that healthcare providers do not shy away from these discussions,” said Senate Aging Committee Chairman Susan Collins (R-Maine). “Until we solve the reimbursement issue, I don’t think we are going to make true progress.”  . Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) said he regretted his failure to talk with his mother, an Alzheimer’s patient, about the end of life care she desired. He lost the opportunity to have this conversation when she lost her ability to communicate, nine years before her death.  . “I was an informed citizen at the time, the governor of Virginia, and yet my family and I didn’t have a full understanding of everything that was before us,” said Warner, indicating that he will reintroduce a measure to create a Medicare and Medicaid benefit for end of life planning.  . When people fail to plan for end of life care, they may suffer through ultimately futile, invasive and often unwanted treatments, advocates say. Surgeon and author Atul Gawande detailed the “medicalization of mortality” occurring over the past several decades, noting that the most likely time for Americans to undergo surgery is the last week of life.  . “We fail to recognize that people have goals and priorities in their lives we need to serve besides just living longer,” Gawande said. “The way you learn what people’s priorities are is by asking.” . Last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rejected an American Medical Association request to create a billing code for doctors to use when they spend time helping patients plan for future care. Patrick Conway, chief CMS medical officer, said the coding would be considered this year. . If physicians will be reimbursed, work remains to ensure the quality of care patients receive. “Metrics in this area are not easy to develop, but they’re not impossible,” said Christine Cassel, president of the National Quality Forum. “Payers need to know they are paying for the right kind of care.” . Reform is necessary, said American Nurses Association president Pamela Cipriano, as the health system is “failing” the majority of Americans at the end of life. . “We consider ourselves a very civilized society, but we have so many who die in a very uncivilized manner.” |Mon Mar 23 22:18:07 +0000 2015||Reimburse doctors for helping patients plan end of life care, experts say |5.801314385463173e+17|http://reut.rs/1HsMedc
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - In a Finnish study spanning 26 years, kids exposed to parental smoking were more likely to develop plaque in their carotid arteries as young adults than kids who were not exposed to secondhand smoke. . These findings and others suggest the health effects of passive smoking on children are not limited to respiratory or developmental health, but can have a long-term impact on cardiovascular health, said senior author Costan G. Magnussen of Menzies Research Institute Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. . Researchers used frozen blood samples from more than 1,000 kids ages three to 18 collected in 1980, along with parental reports of smoking status in 1980 and 1983 from a larger group of kids. They also had ultrasounds of the adult children in 2001 and 2007. . They tested the blood samples for levels of cotinine, a byproduct of cigarette smoke exposure, and looked for a buildup of plaque in the carotid arteries, two large blood vessels of the neck, on the adult ultrasounds. Carotid plaque can cause narrowing of the arteries, increasing blood clot and stroke risk, according to the National Institutes of Health. . About two percent of the grown-up kids had a carotid plaque uncovered by ultrasound at an average age of 36. . More than 84 percent of kids of nonsmokers had no cotinine in their blood, compared to 62 percent of those with one smoking parent and 43 percent when both parents smoked. . The authors assumed that kids with a parent who admitted to smoking who did not have cotinine in their blood had been exposed to less secondhand smoke, possibly because parents had been careful to keep their smoking away from the child. . Compared to kids of nonsmokers, these kids were about one and a half times as likely to have carotid artery plaque as adults. But kids of smokers with poorer “smoking hygiene” that exposed them to more smoke (and resulted in cotinine in their blood) were four times as likely to have carotid artery plaque as those with nonsmoking parents. . “What we were able to do that others have not, is show that parents who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking can still limit the impact of their smoking on their child’s future cardiovascular health by changing their smoking behavior to limit the amount of smoke their child is exposed to,” Magnussen told Reuters Health by email.  . Many smoking parents did not smoke inside the home or car, or smoked well away from their children, to the point where there was no evidence for passive smoke exposure in their child’s blood, Magnussen said. . Plaque buildup, or “atherosclerosis,” can begin in childhood so the results are not surprising, according to Karin B. Michels, an epidemiologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston. . But only 64 out of more than 2,000 grown subjects did develop plaque, which is a very small number, Michels told Reuters Health by phone. . “I would be a little cautious but overall I think it’s an important study and lends more support to the risk of passive smoking for children,” she said. “I don’t doubt that there is a risk and it could be affecting other things like blood pressure.” . Atherosclerotic plaque is particularly dangerous when it develops at an early age, she said.  . This group of kids grew up in a time when smoking was much more ubiquitous, and they would have been exposed to more secondhand and thirdhand smoke, said Melbourne Hovell of San Diego State University, who was not part of the new study.  . “Thirdhand smoke” is that which lingers on surfaces or in environments and may combine with other chemicals to create toxic substances over time, Hovell told Reuters Health by phone. . Early smoke exposure may have several deleterious effects other than just plaque buildup in the arteries, including an increased risk of later breast cancer and a predisposition to nicotine addiction, Hovell said. Plus, children of smokers are more likely to become smokers themselves, triggering a cascade of other health risks. . “It’s pretty much a perfect storm,” Hovel said. . “The other message for the lay public is to not allow any smoking in your home or car,” as it will contaminate the environment indefinitely, he said. “Parents with young children probably should avoid buying a used car that has been smoked in.” .

Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government is developing a vaccine to protect poultry from new strains of avian flu that have recently killed birds from Arkansas to Washington state.  . Within two months, scientists at a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) research lab in Georgia will test the vaccine on chickens to see how well it prevents them from getting sick and dying of the virus, which the government says is spread by wild birds. . Progress toward creating a vaccine has not previously been reported. It comes after the H5N8 and H5N2 flu strains have infected commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks in eight states since December.  . In response to the cases, key overseas buyers have limited imports of U.S. poultry, and the world’s biggest poultry producers, including Tyson Foods Inc and Sanderson Farms Inc, have increased biosecurity at farms. . The government has no plans to distribute the vaccine yet, officials said on Monday. Instead, the United States will continue to cull infected flocks and test nearby birds to prevent transmission. . The United States is developing the vaccine in case it needs a countermeasure to the containment strategy, said T.J. Myers, associate deputy director of surveillance, preparedness, and response services for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The agency will ultimately decide whether to release the vaccine. . The new strains have been found in wild birds that can carry the virus so “there’s really no way to predict where the next case might be,” Myers said. Vaccinating all poultry nationwide is not considered practical or necessary, he added. . Use of a vaccine may be considered if avian flu “gets to the point where we cannot contain it,” said Mark Jackwood, head of the University of Georgia’s Department of Population Health.  . Zoetis Inc, the world’s largest animal-health company, said it was in contact with USDA about the flu infections. The company has a vaccine approved for use in countries outside the United States. . The U.S. Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, which is working on the new vaccine, tested the effectiveness of an existing vaccine on the new strains. It did not perform as well as scientists wanted, Director David Swayne said. . Separately, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing to respond if birds transmit the flu to humans, said Michael Jhung, a medical officer for the influenza division. The risk for human infection is considered low. |Mon Mar 23 22:18:06 +0000 2015||U.S. developing bird flu vaccine, no plans to distribute it yet |5.801314306358231e+17|http://reut.rs/1HsMetq
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Abiomed Inc’s miniature blood pump system that maintains heart function and circulation during high-risk procedures. . The company’s shares rose about 2 percent to $62.42 in after-market trading on Monday. . The device, Impella 2.5 System, can be used during angioplasty and stenting, the regulator said.  (. ) . Angioplasty and stenting are procedures used to re-open arteries in the heart that are blocked due to coronary artery disease, a condition that is the leading cause of death in the United States. . The FDA said data showed few later adverse events in patients using the pump during procedures, compared to those using the conventional intra-aortic balloon pump. . The Impella 2.5 System draws blood from the left lower chamber of the heart and pumps it to the main blood vessel to maintain stable heart function. . The device can be used in patients who have severe coronary artery disease but are not candidates for bypass treatment, the regulator said. |Mon Mar 23 22:02:16 +0000 2015||FDA approves Abiomed's blood pump device |5.801274486139372e+17|http://reut.rs/1HsHDHN
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – - There is not enough evidence to recommend for or against testing for thyroid dysfunction in adults without symptoms, according to a U.S. government-backed panel. . “We don’t view this as the final word,” Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, vice chairperson of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). . “We view this as a call to the research community to help us provide this evidence,” she said in a phone interview with Reuters Health. . The thyroid, which is a gland in the neck, produces hormones that affect several bodily processes, including metabolism and growth. If left untreated, thyroid dysfunction may lead to death or a number of conditions, including heart disease and cancer, the USPSTF writes in the Annals of Internal Medicine. . Doctors can check thyroid function with a blood test that looks for thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. The hormone is what prompts the thyroid to produce its own hormones. . Abnormal tests should be confirmed with repeat testing over three to six months. Then testing for specific thyroid hormones can look for possible or overt dysfunction, the USPSTF writes. . They add that up to a quarter of U.S. adults are screened for thyroid dysfunction every year. Depending on whether the thyroid is over reactive or underactive, the treatment can include drugs or oral hormone therapy. . The USPSTF last reviewed the evidence for thyroid dysfunction screening in 2004. . In the new review, the panel said they could not estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in adults without symptoms who are not pregnant. . “I want to be clear that it’s very clear that this does not apply to patients who have symptoms,” said Bibbins-Domingo, who is also a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. . “Our goal is to review and update recommendations every five years,” she said, adding that the panel also updates recommendations should any evidence become available. . “The call is really to the research community to do more studies to give us the evidence,” Bibbins-Domingo said. .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Eleven years later, women who took a stress management course after being diagnosed with breast cancer were still reaping the benefits of the training. . Even after more than a decade, breast cancer patients who completed the 10 week stress management program early after diagnosis had higher mood and quality of life scores than others who hadn’t taken the course. . Depression is common during cancer treatment and afterward, said senior author Michael H. Antoni of the University of Miami, in Coral Gables, Florida. . Cognitive behavioral stress management techniques “such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing techniques along with strategies for changing self-defeating and irrational thoughts about life stressors, a procedure called ‘cognitive restructuring,’ can be learned and applied to daily life and breast cancer specific stressors” Antoni told Reuters Health by email. . These techniques “have been shown to improve regulation of the adrenal stress hormone cortisol in women under treatment for breast cancer,” he added. “Since better regulation of cortisol relates to less depression and inflammation, this suggests the health value of these techniques.” . The researchers recruited women shortly after their breast cancer surgery between 1998 and 2005, randomly assigning them to either a one-day breast cancer education seminar, or a 10-week group-based stress management behavioral therapy program with guided sessions on coping skills, identifying sources of stress and modifying stress response, anger management, muscle relaxation and breathing exercises. . The one-day education group received information on breast cancer care and health. They also received printed handouts of a condensed version of some of the coping techniques the other group learned, but did not have time to practice them. . In earlier follow-up studies of this same set of women, the stress management group had lower depressive symptoms and better quality of life at six months, one year and five years after the original program, compared to the control group. . In 2013, the authors followed up again and were able to reassess 51 women in the stress management group and 49 in the comparison group, eight to 15 years after the original stress management program. Again, those in the stress management reported better quality of life and physical and emotional well-being, according to results in Cancer. . “Since we taught skills women could apply to daily stress it is plausible that they kept practicing them in order to keep depressive symptoms at bay,” Antoni said.  . Women may be able to learn relaxation, deep breathing and cognitive restructuring techniques without a 10-week group program, but they would not get the camaraderie of being in a group of women in the same situation, he said.   . “This is a package intervention and also developed in a group format,” so it’s difficult to determine which individual aspect of the program led to long-term results, said Julia Rowland, director of the Office of Cancer Survivorship at the National Cancer Institute, who was not part of the new study. . “Groups in and of themselves can be enormously helpful,” Rowland told Reuters Health by phone. . Cancer survivors never have a guarantee that the disease will not come back, which is stressful, and treatment itself can lead to other sources of stress, like fatigue or sexual dysfunction, she said. . The behavioral therapy techniques are available for therapists as a participant workbook, Antoni said.  . If women do not have access to a therapist offering the program, they can seek out other sources of stress management techniques. Some people find the meditative aspect of yoga to be helpful, Rowland said. . It’s also important to stay physically active and foster a strong social network of friends and family, which have been linked to better physical and mental health, she said.  . “You shouldn’t suffer in silence, you shouldn’t suffer at all,” she said. Cancer can be stressful, but if you feel depressed, you should tell your doctor.  . SOURCE: .

Martinne Geller|LONDON (Reuters) - The health warning on a MarkTen electronic cigarette package is 116 words long. . That’s much longer than the warnings on traditional cigarette packs in the United States. Nicotine, the e-cigarette warning says, is “addictive and habit-forming, and it is very toxic by inhalation, in contact with the skin, or if swallowed.” It is not intended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or people ... who take medicine for depression or asthma. “Nicotine can increase your heart rate and blood pressure and cause dizziness, nausea and stomach pain,” says MarkTen, a leading brand in the United States. The ingredients can be “poisonous.” . MarkTen’s parent company Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said the language seemed appropriate. There is no required health warning on electronic cigarettes in the United States, so “we had to do what we thought was right,” said a spokesman for Altria Client Services. . The company’s frankness about the perils of nicotine dates back to the late 1990s, when it led a campaign for cigarettes to be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Small tobacco companies at the time said the big guys would use regulation to seal their dominance. Today, small e-cigarette makers are saying the same thing. Many argue that firms like Altria and Reynolds American want hefty rules to help neutralize the threat that e-cigarettes pose to their businesses. By accentuating the risks of ‘vaping,’ they say, big firms may deter smokers from trying the new devices, even though most scientists agree they are safer. . “If you read that (warning) as a smoker, you might think ‘Oh, I’ll just stick with a cigarette,’” said Oliver Kershaw, a former 15-a-day-smoker who quit through e-cigarettes and founded websites that advocate them. . Big tobacco companies have pushed for a range of controls on e-cigarettes. These include lengthy health warnings, reduced product ranges, restricted sales, and scientific testing requirements. Kershaw and others say such efforts risk squeezing small players. Too many rules would stifle innovation and reduce the range of products to “a very simple, utilitarian e-cigarette,” said Fraser Cropper, CEO of Totally Wicked, an independent e-cigarette company based in the UK.  . Big tobacco companies say their goal in pushing for firm control is not to hurt smaller competitors. Regulation will benefit consumers and e-cigarette companies alike by ensuring safety and quality standards and boosting confidence, they say. Small companies should not be exempt from responsible behavior.  . “Our stated goal is to get to e-vapor leadership, to have the strongest brands in the marketplace,” said the Altria spokesman. He could not predict the impact of increased regulation on smaller firms. “I don’t know how they run their businesses and what it would cost them to meet those requirements.” . Most anti-tobacco campaigners agree that e-cigarettes should be regulated. But some believe they deserve a lighter touch than tobacco because they can help smokers quit, and may be less harmful than smoking. . Measures that make e-cigarettes less appealing or hard to come by may keep people smoking, these people say. Clive Bates, a former head of UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), thinks public health officials who advocate tough controls end up helping Big Tobacco’s conventional brands. . “They really are all doing their utmost to protect the cigarette trade,” Bates said. “They just don’t realize it.” He thinks regulations should encourage smokers to quit, or switch. . The image of e-cigarettes is already changing. The proportion of people in Britain who think vaping is just as harmful as smoking doubled last year to 15 percent, according to a survey by ASH. In the United States, a similar picture is emerging. The growth in U.S. sales of e-cigarettes slowed to 5 percent in the fourth quarter last year from 19 percent a year earlier, according to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. She attributes that partly to increased uncertainty about the products. . Derek Yach, a director at Vitality Institute, a health research company, doubts there is any “conspiratorial effort” to crush the new business. But he says that “if the dominant message is one of doubt, then the status quo gets maintained.” Yach once headed tobacco control at the World Health Organization and worked at PepsiCo. . Japan Tobacco International, the world’s third-largest tobacco company, thinks strict regulations could hurt young firms. “If you make it extremely hard (to comply), you would drive small companies out of business,” said Ian Jones, JTI’s head of scientific and regulatory affairs for emerging products. “You would lose the value of the category, you would lose the spark.” . E-cigarettes came onto the market a decade ago promising a safer nicotine fix. The devices heat nicotine-laced liquid to create an inhalable vapor, rather than burn tobacco. That gives smokers the traditional hand-to-mouth ritual without the deadly smoke. . The global vaping market, which could top $7 billion this year, is evenly split between cigarette look-alikes, often sold by tobacco companies, and refillable “vapors, tanks and mods” - devices which users modify to suit their needs. These are often made by smaller firms. Demand for them is growing three times as fast as the overall market, as users say they find them more satisfying than early all-in-one models. . Serious devotees favor such refillable “open systems” that let them mix and match liquids and batteries to vary their nicotine intake. Open systems are often sold in vape shops and lend an edgy, do-it-yourself creativity to the vaping community. According to Wells Fargo, there are now around 8,500 vape shops in the United States and 19,400 globally. Vape shops account for about one-third of all U.S. sales, while the Internet accounts for another third.  . In August, Reynolds – which does not produce mods - urged the FDA to “ban open system e-cigarettes, including all component parts.” Such systems, Reynolds wrote, present a “unique risk for adulteration, tampering and quality control.” . If the FDA does not want a ban, Reynolds suggested, it should regulate vape shops as manufacturers. That would subject them to FDA inspection, registration, manufacturing standards and product clearance requirements. . Vape shops often mix nicotine and flavoring, just as pharmacies compound drugs, said Richard Smith, communications manager at Reynolds. This means “the vape shop seller is a manufacturer under the applicable laws and regulations.” . E-cigarette independents say such a move targets them; analysts note that the business model of big tobacco firms depends on mass production, not mix-and-match. . “I think they (Reynolds) probably want that snuffed out before it gains traction,” said Philip Gorham, an Amsterdam-based tobacco analyst at Morningstar.  . Reynolds says that’s not true. “We fully support innovation in tobacco products, including vapor products,” said Smith. The company wants “a level playing-field where all manufacturers are subject to equal treatment.” . Shane MacGuill, a tobacco analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International, said Reynolds’ move may seem zealous, but companies have a duty to shareholders: “It would be remiss ... of them not to try and push for the competitive environment that is as favorable to them as possible.” . Steven Parrish, a former Altria executive who retired in 2008, said that as long as people are honest, there’s nothing wrong with advocating to protect their interests. And embracing regulation can help the tobacco industry win trust. . “I think one of the things the industry would like to see ... is a world in which the tobacco industry is much more like the pharmaceutical industry in terms of how it operates,” he said: “Very heavily regulated and maybe not loved and admired, but at least acknowledged as a legitimate business.” . That makes young people a particularly sensitive point of tension. . Most e-cigarette companies want tighter controls on who can buy, such as a minimum age. Altria’s NuMark goes further. It says U.S. purchases should also be “clerk-assisted or conducted in an otherwise non-self-service environment.”  . Smaller e-cigarette makers say that would hand a big advantage to tobacco companies. . U.S. convenience stores are the main outlets for tobacco products. Tobacco firms offer the stores rich incentives to promote their brands, and according to Morningstar, tobacco can provide more than a third of stores’ profit. Cigarettes can only be sold behind the counter. They are displayed on heavily branded shelving which the tobacco firms often provide. . Putting e-cigarettes behind the counter would force the products to compete for consumer attention in space that tobacco firms influence, small companies say. . “As long as you say it has to be 12 feet from a child’s hand at the counter, it guarantees (the e-cigarette) gets onto their wall,” said Jan Verleur, CEO and co-founder of VMR, a Miami-based e-cigarette company.  . Altria says retailers choose how and where to display products. . Some small e-cig firms are pushing back. Totally Wicked is challenging Europe’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), which was adopted in 2014 and comes into force in 2016.  . It’s up to member states to apply the EU rules in their own way, but the directive says manufacturers must tell regulators what’s in a new product six months before launch. Producers will have to list ingredients, emissions, toxicological data, nicotine doses and uptake, as well as health effects. A new notification is required for every big change.  . Totally Wicked is fighting the TPD in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Such detailed reporting is more onerous even than for traditional cigarettes, the company argues. It says it is disproportionate, considering that e-cigarettes are probably less harmful. Its CEO says the six-month notification would slow innovation in an industry where manufacturers can move from concept to shelf in 10 weeks. . British American Tobacco’s Nicoventures unit agrees with Totally Wicked that the six-month notice period “runs the risk of stifling innovation,” according to a spokeswoman. . But global tobacco leader Philip Morris International – which used to be part of Altria - said it thinks this kind of advance notification is appropriate to ensure standards. Its own tests already go beyond the TPD rules, a spokeswoman said. Robust scientific research is “something we believe in as the core of our work in this new product category.” . In the United States, the FDA aims to deliver its final ruling on e-cigarettes in June. E-cigarette firms there say anything that requires lengthy and costly trials could be manageable for big business but may hurt smaller companies. “The more science that’s required, the more expensive it becomes,” said Sanjiv Desai, general counsel of U.S. e-cigarette firm VMR. . A spokesman for the FDA said it was weighing the burden on everyone, including small manufacturers. It plans to help small companies by phasing in new rules. The European Union also plans to give firms time to adapt. It has said clear rules will help smaller firms; it plans to assess the costs of notification. . For Yach, the former WHO tobacco official, regulators should remember that e-cigarettes are more than a new business. “A heavy smoker has a 20 times greater risk of lung cancer,” Yach said. “Switch to e-cigarettes and that risk is virtually going to zero.” |Mon Mar 23 20:31:17 +0000 2015||RT @specialreports: When it comes to e-cigarettes, Big Tobacco is concerned for your health  @specialreports #ecigs h…|5.801045510275727e+17|http://reut.rs/1HnTOWd
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) – - When teens take pills for depression and anxiety, doctors need to make sure they understand that sexual side effects are common with the drugs, a new paper advises. . Under the best of circumstances, it can be awkward for doctors to discuss sex with teens. But this particular sex talk is made even harder by the lack of studies exploring how common antidepressants impact libido, orgasm and ejaculation in young patients, the authors say. . With selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, for example, “the sexual side effects are very prevalent . . . and if you don’t ask about it, especially with adolescents, they are not going to tell you,” said Dr. Amir Levine of Columbia University in New York City, a coauthor, with Eleanor McGlinchey, of the paper in the journal Pediatrics. . SSRIs include Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Celexa (citalopram).  . This family of drugs works on serotonin, a naturally occurring chemical messenger in the brain that controls mood. SSRIs block the reabsorption, or reuptake, of serotonin, making more of the chemical available to transmit messages between brain cells, which is thought to ease depression.  . Adults taking SSRIs may experience sexual side effects more than half the time, some studies estimate, and it’s possible that rates of sexual side effects would be similar in teens, Levine said. Other effects can include weight gain, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, agitation or restlessness and headaches. . In addition, SSRIs carry a black box warning – the most stringent from U.S. regulators – of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in children, adolescents and young adults. . Because the risk of suicidal thoughts is greatest in the first three to six weeks on SSRIs, it’s important that it be stressed in conversations with teens being prescribed these drugs, said Dr. Cora Breuner, a professor at the University of Washington and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on adolescence. . “Many people who are depressed or anxious don’t have much of a libido so the concept of having less of one may be moot if they are having a hard time getting out of bed at all or getting to school or going out with their friends to the mall,” said Breuner, who wasn’t involved in the paper. . Some doctors may hesitate to mention sexual side effects for fear teens might refuse to take the drugs, she said. “That’s a mistake, because kids are just going to go on the internet and refuse the drugs or stop taking the drugs without talking to you.” . When teens do experience sexual side effects with SSRIs, it’s possible that a lower dose or a different type of drug might be able to ease their depression without causing a dip in libido, Levine said. . The best thing physicians and parents can do is make it clear that sexual side effects can occur, and that conversation, particularly with younger teens, might start simply by asking them if they have noticed any changes with their body, said Dr. Tierney Lorenz, a researcher at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.  . Adolescents don’t really know yet what normal sexual function is; they’re still “just trying to figure out what healthy sexuality looks like for them,” said Lorenz, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “That makes it so important that we get a sense of their experience at baseline so we can help them understand any changes.” . Because the sexual side effects of SSRIs haven’t been widely studied in teens, “we are essentially conducting an experiment on our kids,” Lorenz added. “If you are coming of age sexually speaking with this medication on board potentially influencing how you interact with partners, you are not going to be sure if the lack of desire you might be feeling is the way you are, the medication, or the way you feel about the person you’re with. That can have lasting effects on your relationships.” . SOURCE: .

|PARIS (Reuters) - French agricultural group InVivo said on Monday it had finalised a capital increase for its animal health and nutrition division that will see investors led by private equity firm Eurazeo inject 215 million euros ($235.3 million). . InVivo said last year that it planned a capital increase to contribute about half of some 500 million euros in new financing as it seeks to double sales at the division over the next 10 years from 1.3 billion euros last year. . Eurazeo said last month it was in negotiations to enter InVivo NSA’s capital and indicated last week it was looking at investing 114 million euros. . In an invitation to a March 30 signing ceremony, InVivo named the other participants in the capital increase as CDC International Capital (FFC), part of state-owned bank CDC, Credit Agricole’s Idia unit and grain sector investment fund Unigrains. . It did not specify the investment of each partner, but an InVivo spokeswoman said the group would retain 67 percent of the capital.  . Credit Agricole and Unigrains were already shareholders of InVivo NSA under a previous agreement that expired in 2014. . InVivo is a grouping of some 200 farming cooperatives and its activities also include grain trading. |Mon Mar 23 19:10:58 +0000 2015||InVivo finalizes capital increase for animal health unit |5.800843384249876e+17|http://reut.rs/1xsiZYe
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would not recommend changes to the prescribing or use of Eli Lilly and Co’s schizophrenia drug after a review of two deaths. . Elevated levels of the drug, Zyprexa Relprevv, were found in the two patients who died in 2013, three to four days after receiving the injection. . The FDA said its investigation into the deaths was inconclusive. (. ) . The study noted that much of the increase in drug levels could have occurred after death, explaining the extremely high blood levels of the drug found in the two patients. . Zyprexa contains the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. It carries a boxed warning, FDA’s most serious type of warning, for post-injection delirium sedation or olanzapine overdose. . Lilly’s earnings have suffered since late 2011, when Zyprexa, its top-selling drug, began facing cheaper generics in the United States. . Zyprexa’s 2014 sales have fallen to $1.04 billion from $4.62 billion in 2011. |Mon Mar 23 18:59:40 +0000 2015||FDA recommends no changes to Lilly's schizophrenia injection use |5.800814962847334e+17|http://reut.rs/1xsi6Pr
|(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc shares slid 2 percent on Monday after the company warned about potentially fatal risks for patients being treated with its top-selling hepatitis c drugs who also take the potent heart drug amiodarone. . Gilead said it sent cautionary emails to healthcare providers on Friday to notify them of nine cases in which patients treated with its Harvoni or Sovaldi, while also taking amiodarone, suffered a slow heart beat condition known as symptomatic bradycardia. One of the patients died. . The condition was seen almost immediately in six of the patients. Three of the nine required the placement of a pacemaker and seven had also been taking a beta blocker, which slows heart rates. . The labels on the hepatitis C drugs already contain a warning against co-administration with amiodarone and particularly in patients also taking beta blockers. AbbVie’s  rival hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak carries a similar warning. . “We believe this disclosure will have little or no effect on demand for Harvoni and Sovaldi,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. . “First, the underlying patient numbers on amiodarone are relatively small. Second, there is no inherent reason that hepatitis C-infected individuals should have much higher rates of treatment with amiodarone, so the exclusion of co-administration is unlikely to materially affect the dynamics of the market,” he said. . Sovaldi had fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, while the newer combination treatment Harvoni, which includes Sovaldi, had sales of $2.1 billion for the period. . Gilead, in a statement, said “it remains confident in the safety profiles of Sovaldi and Harvoni” and will continue to monitor their safety in collaboration with health regulators and the medical community. . Amiodarone is an older drug used to keep the heart beating normally in patients with life threatening rhythm disorders, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. It has a history of potentially dangerous toxicities. . The new hepatitis C drugs represent a major breakthrough as they can cure well over 90 percent of patients who have the liver destroying virus with virtually none of the troubling side effects of older treatments. . Gilead shares were down $2.05, or 2 percent, at $100.24 on Nasdaq.   |Mon Mar 23 18:41:39 +0000 2015||Gilead shares dip after warning about hepatitis C drug interaction |5.800769627372052e+17|http://reut.rs/1HrFr3c
Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The costs of caring for the uninsured at U.S. hospitals fell by an estimated $7.4 billion in 2014 due to the expansion of healthcare to millions of people under Obamacare, according to a government report released on Monday. . In 2014, hospitals’ uncompensated care costs were estimated at $27.3 billion. But that compared favorably to an estimated $34.7 billion if the uninsured rate had remained at its 2013 level, according to the report from a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. . Most of the reduction came from the 28 states and Washington, D.C., which expanded Medicaid health coverage for the poor, with a reduction in uncompensated care of $5 billion and bad debt of $1.1 billion, according to the report. . Even states that did not expand Medicaid, however, reduced these costs. They saw a $2.4 billion reduction in uncompensated care and an $800 million drop in bad debt. . The government has pointed to the expected decrease in costs for uncompensated care in 2014 as an indication that President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, also known as Obamacare, is working. . Under the law, more than 16.4 million Americans have acquired health coverage, the agency said last week. . The U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering whether or not to let tax subsidies stand for individuals who have purchased health insurance on the federal exchange.  . If it decides against the subsidies, consultancy Avalere Health has estimated that at least 7.5 million people could face premium increases they cannot afford, which could leave millions uninsured. . States across the country also reduced their charity care costs. Expansion states accounted for a $3.9 billion drop and states that did not expand Medicaid accounted for $1.6 billion in reduced costs. . The analysis compared 2014 uncompensated care costs to what they would have been if the uninsured rate had remained at 2013 levels.  . Projections used in the report came from the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Cost Report data; 2014 uninsured estimates from Gallup-Healthways, and CMS Medicaid enrollment numbers. It was prepared by ASPE, a division of HHS. . (Story corrects to say projections data came from Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, not Assistant Secretary of Professional Estimators, in last paragraph.) |Mon Mar 23 17:47:42 +0000 2015||U.S. hospitals' uncompensated care fell by $7.4 billion in 2014: government |5.800633828517151e+17|http://reut.rs/1Hrk0zj
|(Reuters) - Health officials in Southern California said on Monday a “low-risk” traveler who was being monitored and assessed for Ebola after developing a fever and showing signs of illness does not have the disease and is being released from hospital. . The person had been taken on Sunday to an undisclosed hospital for observation, close monitoring and testing for what officials described as precautionary measures in a “low-risk situation.” . The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department said the individual had fallen ill while undergoing a 21-day monitoring and screening program it runs for travelers who have recently returned from countries experiencing Ebola.  . Monday is the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed case of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. More than 10,200 people have died from the disease in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since March 2014. |Mon Mar 23 17:47:41 +0000 2015||California officials assess 'low risk' traveler for Ebola |5.800633810859049e+17|http://reut.rs/1xsbkZT
Emma Farge|DAKAR (Reuters) - Lapses that fueled the Ebola outbreak after it was first discovered a year ago are dogging the final stages of the fight against the virus as fatigue and complacency set in, delaying the end of the deadly epidemic. . Three doctors were discovered to be infected with Ebola at a hospital in Guinea’s capital Conakry last week in what health reports and government officials blamed on a failure to implement basic measures for infection control. . Errors such as these were commonplace at the beginning of the outbreak as ill-prepared medical staff, often without protective equipment, failed to detect Ebola symptoms, turning hospitals into incubation chambers for the virus. . Now, after more than $2 billion in aid and the deaths of more than 10,200 people in West Africa, the same mistakes are resurfacing. . “There’s a lack of vigilance,” said Dr. Jean-Pierre Lamarque, regional health advisor for the French foreign ministry. “We are one year into the epidemic and people are letting their guard down.”  . The discovery of the infections led to the identification and monitoring of up to 150 new high-risk contacts in Conakry just as Guinea, where the outbreak was first detected 12 months ago, appeared to be finally turning the corner. . Ebola has smoldered and then flared up anew in Guinea several times. The minutes of a meeting held by former colonial power France’s coordination team last week described the situation in Conakry as “pre-explosive” as they wait to see how many of the contacts will develop the disease. . Similar oversights dogged the effort to eliminate Ebola in Liberia, which now has just one known case left. One of the last Ebola patients visited a public hospital several times in late January without being correctly diagnosed, causing the number of high-risk contacts to briefly spike. . Ebola cases in Sierra Leone have dropped sharply from a peak of more than 500 in December to around 50 cases a week, helped by British military assistance. Still, officials say some people are chafing at Ebola rules and breaking them. . In Freetown’s Kingtom cemetery, mourners complain that Ebola protocols for burials involving plastic bodybags and pallbearers in coveralls, which are applied universally, go against the last wishes of their loved ones. . Hundreds protested outside the main Freetown mortuary this month when a prominent opposition politician was buried the official way, even though he did not die of Ebola. The government plans a three-day lockdown to try to identify sick being kept in their homes and to reinforce anti-Ebola messages. . “People are slacking up. The new cases are all to do with the violation of rules – contacts leaving their homes, unsafe burials,” said an official in Sierra Leone’s Ebola response team, explaining the decision to implement a lockdown. . Before last year, Ebola outbreaks had mostly occurred in isolated rural locations but this epidemic has spread across borders to Nigeria, Mali and Senegal. . The biggest remaining hotspot is a wedge of land immediately behind a 150-km (95-mile) strip of coastline between Conakry and Freetown. In this region, many people who have been in touch with Ebola patients can move relatively freely back and forth across the shared border, officials say. . The WHO says joint surveillance teams will tackle cross-border transmission but some say not enough has been done and this remains a blind spot. . “There are lots of people who talk about it but you have to really look for evidence of this on the ground,” said Jerome Mouton, Guinea country manager for Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  . MSF, a leading medical charity, was the first to raise the alarm over Ebola and on Monday said the slow international response created an avoidable tragedy. . In Guinea, there continues to be a mix of suspicion and outright violence towards healthcare workers, Mouton said. Seven months from a presidential election, some expect it to intensify. . “Certain people don’t seem to want it over and they don’t want the government to take the credit for ending it,” said Philippe Maughan, senior Ebola operations manager at ECHO, the European Commission’s humanitarian aid branch. . President Alpha Conde has already pushed back the deadline to zero cases from early March to mid-April – a target that the WHO regional director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti still calls “very ambitious”.  |Mon Mar 23 16:33:04 +0000 2015||A year after Ebola discovered, relapses seen in fight to end it |5.800446039922033e+17|http://reut.rs/1HqNUne
Martinne Geller|LONDON (Reuters) - The health warning on a MarkTen electronic cigarette package is 116 words long. . That’s much longer than the warnings on traditional cigarette packs in the United States. Nicotine, the e-cigarette warning says, is “addictive and habit-forming, and it is very toxic by inhalation, in contact with the skin, or if swallowed.” It is not intended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or people ... who take medicine for depression or asthma. “Nicotine can increase your heart rate and blood pressure and cause dizziness, nausea and stomach pain,” says MarkTen, a leading brand in the United States. The ingredients can be “poisonous.” . MarkTen’s parent company Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said the language seemed appropriate. There is no required health warning on electronic cigarettes in the United States, so “we had to do what we thought was right,” said a spokesman for Altria Client Services. . The company’s frankness about the perils of nicotine dates back to the late 1990s, when it led a campaign for cigarettes to be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Small tobacco companies at the time said the big guys would use regulation to seal their dominance. Today, small e-cigarette makers are saying the same thing. Many argue that firms like Altria and Reynolds American want hefty rules to help neutralize the threat that e-cigarettes pose to their businesses. By accentuating the risks of ‘vaping,’ they say, big firms may deter smokers from trying the new devices, even though most scientists agree they are safer. . “If you read that (warning) as a smoker, you might think ‘Oh, I’ll just stick with a cigarette,’” said Oliver Kershaw, a former 15-a-day-smoker who quit through e-cigarettes and founded websites that advocate them. . Big tobacco companies have pushed for a range of controls on e-cigarettes. These include lengthy health warnings, reduced product ranges, restricted sales, and scientific testing requirements. Kershaw and others say such efforts risk squeezing small players. Too many rules would stifle innovation and reduce the range of products to “a very simple, utilitarian e-cigarette,” said Fraser Cropper, CEO of Totally Wicked, an independent e-cigarette company based in the UK.  . Big tobacco companies say their goal in pushing for firm control is not to hurt smaller competitors. Regulation will benefit consumers and e-cigarette companies alike by ensuring safety and quality standards and boosting confidence, they say. Small companies should not be exempt from responsible behavior.  . “Our stated goal is to get to e-vapor leadership, to have the strongest brands in the marketplace,” said the Altria spokesman. He could not predict the impact of increased regulation on smaller firms. “I don’t know how they run their businesses and what it would cost them to meet those requirements.” . Most anti-tobacco campaigners agree that e-cigarettes should be regulated. But some believe they deserve a lighter touch than tobacco because they can help smokers quit, and may be less harmful than smoking. . Measures that make e-cigarettes less appealing or hard to come by may keep people smoking, these people say. Clive Bates, a former head of UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), thinks public health officials who advocate tough controls end up helping Big Tobacco’s conventional brands. . “They really are all doing their utmost to protect the cigarette trade,” Bates said. “They just don’t realize it.” He thinks regulations should encourage smokers to quit, or switch. . The image of e-cigarettes is already changing. The proportion of people in Britain who think vaping is just as harmful as smoking doubled last year to 15 percent, according to a survey by ASH. In the United States, a similar picture is emerging. The growth in U.S. sales of e-cigarettes slowed to 5 percent in the fourth quarter last year from 19 percent a year earlier, according to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. She attributes that partly to increased uncertainty about the products. . Derek Yach, a director at Vitality Institute, a health research company, doubts there is any “conspiratorial effort” to crush the new business. But he says that “if the dominant message is one of doubt, then the status quo gets maintained.” Yach once headed tobacco control at the World Health Organization and worked at PepsiCo. . Japan Tobacco International, the world’s third-largest tobacco company, thinks strict regulations could hurt young firms. “If you make it extremely hard (to comply), you would drive small companies out of business,” said Ian Jones, JTI’s head of scientific and regulatory affairs for emerging products. “You would lose the value of the category, you would lose the spark.” . E-cigarettes came onto the market a decade ago promising a safer nicotine fix. The devices heat nicotine-laced liquid to create an inhalable vapor, rather than burn tobacco. That gives smokers the traditional hand-to-mouth ritual without the deadly smoke. . The global vaping market, which could top $7 billion this year, is evenly split between cigarette look-alikes, often sold by tobacco companies, and refillable “vapors, tanks and mods” - devices which users modify to suit their needs. These are often made by smaller firms. Demand for them is growing three times as fast as the overall market, as users say they find them more satisfying than early all-in-one models. . Serious devotees favor such refillable “open systems” that let them mix and match liquids and batteries to vary their nicotine intake. Open systems are often sold in vape shops and lend an edgy, do-it-yourself creativity to the vaping community. According to Wells Fargo, there are now around 8,500 vape shops in the United States and 19,400 globally. Vape shops account for about one-third of all U.S. sales, while the Internet accounts for another third.  . In August, Reynolds – which does not produce mods - urged the FDA to “ban open system e-cigarettes, including all component parts.” Such systems, Reynolds wrote, present a “unique risk for adulteration, tampering and quality control.” . If the FDA does not want a ban, Reynolds suggested, it should regulate vape shops as manufacturers. That would subject them to FDA inspection, registration, manufacturing standards and product clearance requirements. . Vape shops often mix nicotine and flavoring, just as pharmacies compound drugs, said Richard Smith, communications manager at Reynolds. This means “the vape shop seller is a manufacturer under the applicable laws and regulations.” . E-cigarette independents say such a move targets them; analysts note that the business model of big tobacco firms depends on mass production, not mix-and-match. . “I think they (Reynolds) probably want that snuffed out before it gains traction,” said Philip Gorham, an Amsterdam-based tobacco analyst at Morningstar.  . Reynolds says that’s not true. “We fully support innovation in tobacco products, including vapor products,” said Smith. The company wants “a level playing-field where all manufacturers are subject to equal treatment.” . Shane MacGuill, a tobacco analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International, said Reynolds’ move may seem zealous, but companies have a duty to shareholders: “It would be remiss ... of them not to try and push for the competitive environment that is as favorable to them as possible.” . Steven Parrish, a former Altria executive who retired in 2008, said that as long as people are honest, there’s nothing wrong with advocating to protect their interests. And embracing regulation can help the tobacco industry win trust. . “I think one of the things the industry would like to see ... is a world in which the tobacco industry is much more like the pharmaceutical industry in terms of how it operates,” he said: “Very heavily regulated and maybe not loved and admired, but at least acknowledged as a legitimate business.” . That makes young people a particularly sensitive point of tension. . Most e-cigarette companies want tighter controls on who can buy, such as a minimum age. Altria’s NuMark goes further. It says U.S. purchases should also be “clerk-assisted or conducted in an otherwise non-self-service environment.”  . Smaller e-cigarette makers say that would hand a big advantage to tobacco companies. . U.S. convenience stores are the main outlets for tobacco products. Tobacco firms offer the stores rich incentives to promote their brands, and according to Morningstar, tobacco can provide more than a third of stores’ profit. Cigarettes can only be sold behind the counter. They are displayed on heavily branded shelving which the tobacco firms often provide. . Putting e-cigarettes behind the counter would force the products to compete for consumer attention in space that tobacco firms influence, small companies say. . “As long as you say it has to be 12 feet from a child’s hand at the counter, it guarantees (the e-cigarette) gets onto their wall,” said Jan Verleur, CEO and co-founder of VMR, a Miami-based e-cigarette company.  . Altria says retailers choose how and where to display products. . Some small e-cig firms are pushing back. Totally Wicked is challenging Europe’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), which was adopted in 2014 and comes into force in 2016.  . It’s up to member states to apply the EU rules in their own way, but the directive says manufacturers must tell regulators what’s in a new product six months before launch. Producers will have to list ingredients, emissions, toxicological data, nicotine doses and uptake, as well as health effects. A new notification is required for every big change.  . Totally Wicked is fighting the TPD in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Such detailed reporting is more onerous even than for traditional cigarettes, the company argues. It says it is disproportionate, considering that e-cigarettes are probably less harmful. Its CEO says the six-month notification would slow innovation in an industry where manufacturers can move from concept to shelf in 10 weeks. . British American Tobacco’s Nicoventures unit agrees with Totally Wicked that the six-month notice period “runs the risk of stifling innovation,” according to a spokeswoman. . But global tobacco leader Philip Morris International – which used to be part of Altria - said it thinks this kind of advance notification is appropriate to ensure standards. Its own tests already go beyond the TPD rules, a spokeswoman said. Robust scientific research is “something we believe in as the core of our work in this new product category.” . In the United States, the FDA aims to deliver its final ruling on e-cigarettes in June. E-cigarette firms there say anything that requires lengthy and costly trials could be manageable for big business but may hurt smaller companies. “The more science that’s required, the more expensive it becomes,” said Sanjiv Desai, general counsel of U.S. e-cigarette firm VMR. . A spokesman for the FDA said it was weighing the burden on everyone, including small manufacturers. It plans to help small companies by phasing in new rules. The European Union also plans to give firms time to adapt. It has said clear rules will help smaller firms; it plans to assess the costs of notification. . For Yach, the former WHO tobacco official, regulators should remember that e-cigarettes are more than a new business. “A heavy smoker has a 20 times greater risk of lung cancer,” Yach said. “Switch to e-cigarettes and that risk is virtually going to zero.” |Mon Mar 23 16:26:52 +0000 2015||RT @Reuters: Big tobacco companies push for a range of controls on e-cigarettes.  via @specialreports http://t.co/PNH…|5.800430434678907e+17|http://reut.rs/1xrQWYV
Ben Gruber|Experiments conducted at an underground laboratory at Vanderbilt University could prove vital in the fight against cancer. Alex Walsh, a biomedical researcher, is using a laser to make what she calls organoids glow. . “Organoids are small pieces of a patients’ tumor that are about 100 to 300 microns in diameter and they grow as kind of sphere like shapes.” said Walsh, who recently successfully defended her dissertation on the topic of organoids. . A tiny sample is placed in dish filled with a collagen gel which feeds the tiny tumor, allowing the different cell types that comprise it to thrive as they would inside the human body. The organoid is then dosed with a cocktail of cancer drugs and placed under a microscope at which point it is blasted with a laser. The laser is tuned to the frequencies that cause two enzymes in the cells to glow or fluoresce. Measuring the variations in the intensity of the resulting fluorescence provides a readout of cellular metabolism which, Walsh says, is an accurate and speedy biomarker of drug response. . “We’re using these readouts of cellular metabolism to predict the drug response that the sample came from,” added Walsh. . The tumor-on-a-dish method has proven successful in mice and Melissa Skala, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Vanderbilt University, says the team are now trailing it on tumors from breast cancer patients. She says everyone’s cancer is unique, which is why customizing treatment options is essential. . “So the idea here is to eliminate those drugs that don’t work and if needed replace them with drugs that do work so we are hoping to have the smallest common denominator of drugs that achieve the lowest toxicity yet achieve treatment efficacy,” said Skala adding that the method could prove a game changer for cancer patients. . Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in woman in the United States. according to the American Cancer Society. . Skala says that having the ability to customize a drug protocol for patients before they start chemo may significantly improve the odds for a successful treatment. . “Thirty to forty percent of patience that receive those therapies as their first line therapy don’t respond to those drugs ever. And so they suffer toxicity from treatment that ultimately isn’t going to benefit them,” she said. . “I think we can add to what’s already been done and hopefully just improve the experience of the patient so that they recover faster,” she added. . Along with breast cancer, Skala and her team have also started testing the organoids derived from pancreatic cancer patients. If further trials prove successful, Skala estimates it will take 5 to 10 years to move tumor-on-dishes out of the lab and into the clinic.|Mon Mar 23 16:17:13 +0000 2015||Tumors grown in dishes could help customize cancer treatment |5.80040612545749e+17|http://reut.rs/1xs3VJZ
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Although oncologists increasingly distinguish breast, lung, and other cancers by their molecular drivers, cardiologists have lagged behind in efforts to do something similar for heart disease.  . A study published on Monday could help remedy that: Researchers have found evidence of a genetic basis for an enigmatic kind of heart attack that preferentially strikes young women. . The discovery could help cardiology embrace “precision medicine,” in which illnesses that seem alike turn out to differ in their underlying mechanisms. Just as breast cancers driven by one mutation need different chemotherapy than those driven by another, many heart attacks likely have different causes and so need different treatment. . “The key to precision medicine will be splitting instead of lumping diseases together,” said cardiologist Joseph Loscalzo of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “If we subcategorize patients, we should get better responses to therapy” than with one-size-fits-all approaches. . In the new study, in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers at the Mayo Clinic combed a registry of patients who had suffered spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), in which one layer of a coronary artery splits off from another like cheap laminate. Blood seeps out between the arterial layers, starving the heart of oxygen and causing chest pain. . If not treated quickly, it can cause heart attack and sometimes death. . Once considered rare, SCAD in fact causes up to one-third of heart attacks in women under 50. But it frequently goes unrecognized. . That is a problem because treatment for common heart attack - clearing arterial blockages - can worsen SCAD. Some 30 percent to 40 percent of SCADs should be left to heal on their own, said Mayo’s Dr. Sharonne Hayes, who led the study. . She and colleagues identified five pairs of relatives, including first cousins, with SCAD. It is the first evidence that at least some SCAD is genetic, a step toward identifying the relevant DNA. . One of the cousins was about to undergo a procedure to clear what doctors assumed was a blocked artery. A physician suddenly realized that her symptoms and profile resembled another young woman: She died when the blockage-clearing procedure fatally injured her SCAD-damaged artery. The procedure was canceled and the cousin recovered on her own. . Doctors should be aware, Hayes said, that women without standard risk factors for heart attack, such as elevated cholesterol, but with a female relative who had a heart attack before age 50 may be at risk for SCAD. |Mon Mar 23 15:30:16 +0000 2015||Uncommon form of heart attack likely runs in family: study |5.800287985419633e+17|http://reut.rs/1HqnBOd
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis have the three top new drugs set to reach the market in 2015, among 11 products each with $1 billion-plus sales potential, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis. . More potential blockbusters are expected to be launched this year than last, in an encouraging sign for the pharmaceutical industry, which relies on new products to replenish sales as older medicines go off patent. . Regulators have been approving more new drugs in recent years but there remains a debate as to how far this will translate into bigger overall sales and profits, since many modern medicines are for rare diseases. . The three biggest potential blockbusters launching this year, however, offer new ways of fighting cancer, high cholesterol and heart failure — all markets targeting relatively large numbers of patients. . In total, 11 of the many new drugs set for launch in 2015 are expected to generate $1 billion-plus annual sales within five years, up from three in 2014, Thomson Reuters Cortellis said in its latest “Drugs to Watch” report on Monday.  . Bristol-Myers’ cancer medicine Opdivo tops the list, with projected 2019 sales of $5.7 billion, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Cortellis. . Opdivo belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells. . The drug went on sale in Japan in September 2014 but was only approved for melanoma in the United States at the end of December, since when it has also received a green light for lung cancer, underlying the potential that healthcare authorities see in such so-called immunotherapies. . Sanofi’s cholesterol drug Praluent, which is being developed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is expected to generate annual sales in 2019 of $4.4 billion — twice that seen for Amgen’s rival Repatha. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to decide this summer whether to approve the two drugs, which both tackle difficult-to-treat cases of high cholesterol by targeting a protein known as PCSK9. . Novartis’ new first-in-class heart failure drug LCZ-696, meanwhile, is forecast to sell $3.7 billion by 2019, following impressive clinical trial results. The drug could win U.S. approval in August. |Mon Mar 23 14:13:32 +0000 2015||Bristol, Sanofi and Novartis drugs to shine among 2015 launches |5.800094858314424e+17|http://reut.rs/1xrNGNf
Kieran Guilbert|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mosquitoes carrying deadly diseases including dengue fever and West Nile virus could become widespread across Britain within decades due to climate change, health experts said on Monday. . Warmer temperatures and increasing rainfall could provide ideal conditions for the Asian tiger mosquito, which spreads the viruses causing dengue and chikungunya, to breed and expand into Britain, said a study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. . Vector-borne diseases which are transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, are on the rise and have spread across new parts of Europe, including Greece, Italy and France, over the past decade, the study said. . “Lessons from the outbreaks of West Nile virus in North America and chikungunya in the Caribbean emphasize the need to assess future vector-borne disease risks and prepare contingencies for future outbreaks,” said Steve Leach from the emergency response department at Public Health England, a government body responsible for improving health and wellbeing.  . An outbreak of chikungunya in the Caribbean was first identified in December 2013. By January this year the number had soared from two cases to more than 1.13 million in the Caribbean, Latin America and the United States. . Globally, there are an estimated 390 million dengue infections per year.  . As with dengue fever and chikungunya, there is no vaccine for West Nile which infected 9,862 people and caused 264 deaths in the United States in 2003. . The climate in Britain, which is home to 34 different species of mosquito, is already suitable for the transmission of West Nile virus, but there have been no human cases so far, the study said.       . A rise in temperature of just two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) could extend the mosquito season by a month and expand areas of Britain suitable for the insects by almost a third by 2030, experts said. . Climate change models predict suitable temperatures for one month of chikungunya virus transmission in London by 2041, and up to three months in southeast England by 2071.         . Several species of mosquitoes originating from Asia have been imported into Britain through the global trade in used tires, which are often transported large distances along motorways, moving the eggs to new habitats, the study found. . While no non native mosquitoes have been detected in Britain so far, a better system to monitor imported used tires should be considered, said Jolyon Medlock, joint author of the report and head of medical entomology at Public Health England. . The government body has been conducting surveillance at seaports, airports and some motorway service stations, he said. . Climate change is just one of many factors, including urbanization, land-use change, migration and globalization, driving the increase in vector-borne diseases in Britain, according to the study.   |Mon Mar 23 13:23:58 +0000 2015||Deadly mosquito-borne diseases could threaten UK within decades, experts warn |5.799970121852355e+17|http://reut.rs/1HpzFPz
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co will resume  late-stage studies of their drug tanezumab for chronic pain after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted a partial hold on trials of it and similar medicines. . Pfizer expects to receive a $200 million upfront payment from Lilly as a result of the development, the companies said on Monday. . The FDA, in December 2012, restricted clinical studies of tanezumab and other pain drugs that work by blocking a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF), because of nervous-system side effects seen in animal studies conducted by other companies. But the agency allowed trials of the non-narcotic medicine against terminal cancer pain to continue. . Pfizer and Lilly said they will now resume the chronic pain studies because the FDA, after reviewing positive nonclinical data on the nervous system responses to tanezumab, had lifted the partial hold.  . If tanezumab is approved, it could have sales of $100 million in 2020, Cowen and Co has forecast, which could grow further as the drug is approved for new pain conditions. . Still, Tanezumab could face competition from anti-NGF drugs being developed by others, including a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi. . Shares of Pfizer surged 2.9 percent to $35.23 in morning trading Monday. Eli Lilly was up 1.3 percent at $77.10.  . Pfizer and Lilly agreed in 2013 to jointly develop and sell tanezumab for several pain-related conditions, with the companies equally sharing development expenses and future sales. . Tanezumab had shown initial promise in relieving pain in the knee and lower back, but Pfizer in 2010 suspended large late-stage trials of the drug for those conditions due to reports that patients’ osteoarthritis had worsened. . The FDA, however, later recommended that the osteoarthritis trials continue if safeguards were put in place and patients did not simultaneously take other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. . One of Pfizer’s biggest products is Celebrex, another pain and arthritis drug, which had global sales last year of $2.7 billion. But its sales are expected to plunge this year, following the drug’s loss of U.S. marketing exclusivity in December. |Mon Mar 23 12:32:12 +0000 2015||Pfizer, Lilly to resume late-stage study testing pain drug |5.799839851215913e+17|http://reut.rs/1xrH1SZ
Rosmi Shaji|(Reuters) - MEI Pharma lost more than two-thirds of its market value on Monday after the company’s cancer drug failed to meet the main goal in a mid-stage study. . The drug, pracinostat, was being tested in combination with chemotherapy drug azacitidine to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) - a blood cancer where immature blood cells in the bone marrow fail to become healthy cells. . The trial failure raised questions about the future of the drug, which is also being tested for another rare blood cancer. . “The risk profile for pracinostat has significantly increased and one potential scenario is the discontinuation of the drug’s development,” Roth Capital’s Joseph Pantginis said, slashing his price target on the stock to $2.50 from $14 and downgrading it to “neutral” from “buy”. . The company’s shares were down 68 percent at $1.99 in morning trading on Monday. Up to Friday’s closing, the stock had climbed 52 percent in the past three months. . Pantginis said Pracinostat’s failure called into question a late-stage study of the drug in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, scheduled to begin in mid-2015. . The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted an orphan status to the drug for treating patients with AML. The status, granted to drugs being developed to treat rare diseases, gives developers incentives such as marketing exclusivity. . MEI Pharma said the combination of pracinostat and azacitidine showed no difference in complete remission in previously untreated MDS patients when compared with azacitidine alone. . Complete remission implies the disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment. It does not always constitute a cure. . The company said it does not plan to start any further studies on the combination treatment until it gains a “complete understanding” of the clinical data. . “The underlying decision management is assessing is the overall market potential for pracinostat versus the cost of development”, Pantginis wrote in a note. . The San Diego-based drug developer acquired exclusive worldwide rights to the drug from S*BIO Pte Ltd, a privately held biotechnology company, in August 2012. |Mon Mar 23 11:44:54 +0000 2015||MEI Pharma's cancer drug misses main goals in mid-stage study |5.799720807598653e+17|http://reut.rs/1xrEs3j
Susan Kelly|(Reuters) - Tenet Healthcare Corp (. ) on Monday said it would become the largest U.S. provider of outpatient surgery services through a joint venture with United Surgical Partners International and expects to fully own the company within five years. . More medical procedures are being performed on an outpatient basis as technology improves, thus lowering costs by allowing patients to go home sooner.  . Tenet’s shares rose 5.4 percent to $52.32 in midday trading, as investors applauded the move into an area of healthcare that is seeing faster growth and higher margins.  . Tenet, the third-largest U.S. hospital operator, said it will pay $425 million to private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and other USPI shareholders and assume $1.5 billion of USPI’s debt for a 50.1 percent stake in the venture.  . The company will have 244 ambulatory surgery centers, 16 short-stay surgical hospitals and 20 imaging centers in 29 states.     . Tenet’s move comes as more Americans obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act through government-run marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. As healthcare providers gain more insured patients, federal subsidies to hospitals are being scaled back.     . “The purchase of USPI, which is a quality ambulatory surgery center asset, gives them a good growth driver to offset the pressures of backloaded reimbursement cuts with Obamacare,” said Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte. . Ambulatory, or outpatient, surgery allows patients to return home on the same day a procedure is performed. . Other large hospital operators are likely to follow suit and look to expand in the faster-growth outpatient sector, Gupte said.  . Tenet rival HCA Holdings Inc (. ), the country’s largest hospital chain, currently operates 113 freestanding surgery centers. . United Surgical’s competitors include Amsurg Corp AMSG.O and Surgical Care Affiliates Inc SCAI.O. . United Surgical was not initially looking for a buyer, said Tenet Chief Executive Trevor Fetter. . “It wasn’t for sale. This is a way for us to create a structure where ultimately we have the ability to own the whole company but we don’t need to do that from the beginning,” Fetter said in an interview.     . The joint venture with United Surgical also allows Tenet to pay down debt over time.  . “You should expect to see the joint venture structure more often in the healthcare business,” Fetter said. . Tenet also will buy Aspen Healthcare from Welsh Carson for about $215 million in cash to enter the UK short-stay surgery market. . Tenet said it plans to raise $2.2 billion in debt to fund the two transactions, which are expected to close by the third quarter. It expects the deal to be neutral to its earnings this year and add to profit in 2016.    . J.P. Morgan and Lazard are Tenet’s financial advisers and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher is its legal counsel. . USPI and Aspen are being advised by Barclays and Goldman Sachs. USPI’s legal adviser is Ropes & Gray LLP. |Mon Mar 23 10:53:04 +0000 2015||Tenet, United Surgical to form joint venture for $1.9 billion |5.799590362857308e+17|http://reut.rs/1HoO5Q6
Martinne Geller|LONDON (Reuters) - The health warning on a MarkTen electronic cigarette package is 116 words long. . That’s much longer than the warnings on traditional cigarette packs in the United States. Nicotine, the e-cigarette warning says, is “addictive and habit-forming, and it is very toxic by inhalation, in contact with the skin, or if swallowed.” It is not intended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or people ... who take medicine for depression or asthma. “Nicotine can increase your heart rate and blood pressure and cause dizziness, nausea and stomach pain,” says MarkTen, a leading brand in the United States. The ingredients can be “poisonous.” . MarkTen’s parent company Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said the language seemed appropriate. There is no required health warning on electronic cigarettes in the United States, so “we had to do what we thought was right,” said a spokesman for Altria Client Services. . The company’s frankness about the perils of nicotine dates back to the late 1990s, when it led a campaign for cigarettes to be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Small tobacco companies at the time said the big guys would use regulation to seal their dominance. Today, small e-cigarette makers are saying the same thing. Many argue that firms like Altria and Reynolds American want hefty rules to help neutralize the threat that e-cigarettes pose to their businesses. By accentuating the risks of ‘vaping,’ they say, big firms may deter smokers from trying the new devices, even though most scientists agree they are safer. . “If you read that (warning) as a smoker, you might think ‘Oh, I’ll just stick with a cigarette,’” said Oliver Kershaw, a former 15-a-day-smoker who quit through e-cigarettes and founded websites that advocate them. . Big tobacco companies have pushed for a range of controls on e-cigarettes. These include lengthy health warnings, reduced product ranges, restricted sales, and scientific testing requirements. Kershaw and others say such efforts risk squeezing small players. Too many rules would stifle innovation and reduce the range of products to “a very simple, utilitarian e-cigarette,” said Fraser Cropper, CEO of Totally Wicked, an independent e-cigarette company based in the UK.  . Big tobacco companies say their goal in pushing for firm control is not to hurt smaller competitors. Regulation will benefit consumers and e-cigarette companies alike by ensuring safety and quality standards and boosting confidence, they say. Small companies should not be exempt from responsible behavior.  . “Our stated goal is to get to e-vapor leadership, to have the strongest brands in the marketplace,” said the Altria spokesman. He could not predict the impact of increased regulation on smaller firms. “I don’t know how they run their businesses and what it would cost them to meet those requirements.” . Most anti-tobacco campaigners agree that e-cigarettes should be regulated. But some believe they deserve a lighter touch than tobacco because they can help smokers quit, and may be less harmful than smoking. . Measures that make e-cigarettes less appealing or hard to come by may keep people smoking, these people say. Clive Bates, a former head of UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), thinks public health officials who advocate tough controls end up helping Big Tobacco’s conventional brands. . “They really are all doing their utmost to protect the cigarette trade,” Bates said. “They just don’t realize it.” He thinks regulations should encourage smokers to quit, or switch. . The image of e-cigarettes is already changing. The proportion of people in Britain who think vaping is just as harmful as smoking doubled last year to 15 percent, according to a survey by ASH. In the United States, a similar picture is emerging. The growth in U.S. sales of e-cigarettes slowed to 5 percent in the fourth quarter last year from 19 percent a year earlier, according to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. She attributes that partly to increased uncertainty about the products. . Derek Yach, a director at Vitality Institute, a health research company, doubts there is any “conspiratorial effort” to crush the new business. But he says that “if the dominant message is one of doubt, then the status quo gets maintained.” Yach once headed tobacco control at the World Health Organization and worked at PepsiCo. . Japan Tobacco International, the world’s third-largest tobacco company, thinks strict regulations could hurt young firms. “If you make it extremely hard (to comply), you would drive small companies out of business,” said Ian Jones, JTI’s head of scientific and regulatory affairs for emerging products. “You would lose the value of the category, you would lose the spark.” . E-cigarettes came onto the market a decade ago promising a safer nicotine fix. The devices heat nicotine-laced liquid to create an inhalable vapor, rather than burn tobacco. That gives smokers the traditional hand-to-mouth ritual without the deadly smoke. . The global vaping market, which could top $7 billion this year, is evenly split between cigarette look-alikes, often sold by tobacco companies, and refillable “vapors, tanks and mods” - devices which users modify to suit their needs. These are often made by smaller firms. Demand for them is growing three times as fast as the overall market, as users say they find them more satisfying than early all-in-one models. . Serious devotees favor such refillable “open systems” that let them mix and match liquids and batteries to vary their nicotine intake. Open systems are often sold in vape shops and lend an edgy, do-it-yourself creativity to the vaping community. According to Wells Fargo, there are now around 8,500 vape shops in the United States and 19,400 globally. Vape shops account for about one-third of all U.S. sales, while the Internet accounts for another third.  . In August, Reynolds – which does not produce mods - urged the FDA to “ban open system e-cigarettes, including all component parts.” Such systems, Reynolds wrote, present a “unique risk for adulteration, tampering and quality control.” . If the FDA does not want a ban, Reynolds suggested, it should regulate vape shops as manufacturers. That would subject them to FDA inspection, registration, manufacturing standards and product clearance requirements. . Vape shops often mix nicotine and flavoring, just as pharmacies compound drugs, said Richard Smith, communications manager at Reynolds. This means “the vape shop seller is a manufacturer under the applicable laws and regulations.” . E-cigarette independents say such a move targets them; analysts note that the business model of big tobacco firms depends on mass production, not mix-and-match. . “I think they (Reynolds) probably want that snuffed out before it gains traction,” said Philip Gorham, an Amsterdam-based tobacco analyst at Morningstar.  . Reynolds says that’s not true. “We fully support innovation in tobacco products, including vapor products,” said Smith. The company wants “a level playing-field where all manufacturers are subject to equal treatment.” . Shane MacGuill, a tobacco analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International, said Reynolds’ move may seem zealous, but companies have a duty to shareholders: “It would be remiss ... of them not to try and push for the competitive environment that is as favorable to them as possible.” . Steven Parrish, a former Altria executive who retired in 2008, said that as long as people are honest, there’s nothing wrong with advocating to protect their interests. And embracing regulation can help the tobacco industry win trust. . “I think one of the things the industry would like to see ... is a world in which the tobacco industry is much more like the pharmaceutical industry in terms of how it operates,” he said: “Very heavily regulated and maybe not loved and admired, but at least acknowledged as a legitimate business.” . That makes young people a particularly sensitive point of tension. . Most e-cigarette companies want tighter controls on who can buy, such as a minimum age. Altria’s NuMark goes further. It says U.S. purchases should also be “clerk-assisted or conducted in an otherwise non-self-service environment.”  . Smaller e-cigarette makers say that would hand a big advantage to tobacco companies. . U.S. convenience stores are the main outlets for tobacco products. Tobacco firms offer the stores rich incentives to promote their brands, and according to Morningstar, tobacco can provide more than a third of stores’ profit. Cigarettes can only be sold behind the counter. They are displayed on heavily branded shelving which the tobacco firms often provide. . Putting e-cigarettes behind the counter would force the products to compete for consumer attention in space that tobacco firms influence, small companies say. . “As long as you say it has to be 12 feet from a child’s hand at the counter, it guarantees (the e-cigarette) gets onto their wall,” said Jan Verleur, CEO and co-founder of VMR, a Miami-based e-cigarette company.  . Altria says retailers choose how and where to display products. . Some small e-cig firms are pushing back. Totally Wicked is challenging Europe’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), which was adopted in 2014 and comes into force in 2016.  . It’s up to member states to apply the EU rules in their own way, but the directive says manufacturers must tell regulators what’s in a new product six months before launch. Producers will have to list ingredients, emissions, toxicological data, nicotine doses and uptake, as well as health effects. A new notification is required for every big change.  . Totally Wicked is fighting the TPD in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Such detailed reporting is more onerous even than for traditional cigarettes, the company argues. It says it is disproportionate, considering that e-cigarettes are probably less harmful. Its CEO says the six-month notification would slow innovation in an industry where manufacturers can move from concept to shelf in 10 weeks. . British American Tobacco’s Nicoventures unit agrees with Totally Wicked that the six-month notice period “runs the risk of stifling innovation,” according to a spokeswoman. . But global tobacco leader Philip Morris International – which used to be part of Altria - said it thinks this kind of advance notification is appropriate to ensure standards. Its own tests already go beyond the TPD rules, a spokeswoman said. Robust scientific research is “something we believe in as the core of our work in this new product category.” . In the United States, the FDA aims to deliver its final ruling on e-cigarettes in June. E-cigarette firms there say anything that requires lengthy and costly trials could be manageable for big business but may hurt smaller companies. “The more science that’s required, the more expensive it becomes,” said Sanjiv Desai, general counsel of U.S. e-cigarette firm VMR. . A spokesman for the FDA said it was weighing the burden on everyone, including small manufacturers. It plans to help small companies by phasing in new rules. The European Union also plans to give firms time to adapt. It has said clear rules will help smaller firms; it plans to assess the costs of notification. . For Yach, the former WHO tobacco official, regulators should remember that e-cigarettes are more than a new business. “A heavy smoker has a 20 times greater risk of lung cancer,” Yach said. “Switch to e-cigarettes and that risk is virtually going to zero.” |Mon Mar 23 07:39:35 +0000 2015||Special Report: When it comes to e-cigs, Big Tobacco is concerned for your health |5.799103486580941e+17|http://reut.rs/1xrrYc3
Bill Berkrot|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc has seen its market value quadruple in three years to more than $100 billion on the back of its successful multiple sclerosis drugs. Now it has new ambitions in its sights. . The Massachusetts-based company, which made headlines last week when it announced better-than-expected clinical trial results for its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, aducanumab, said that it will drop Idec from its name as of Monday and adopt a new logo. The company merged with Idec Pharmaceuticals more than a decade ago. . Chief Executive George Scangos says that going forward he will keep Biogen focused on developing drugs for some of the hardest-to-treat diseases.                . “Five years down the road, with some luck, we’ll have an Alzheimer’s drug that’s getting approved,” Scangos told Reuters. “I hope we can transform the treatment of MS. By that time, we will have made substantial progress on ALS and other nerve degenerative diseases, spinal muscular atrophy in kids. All that stuff is on our plate,” he said. . “I am sure of two things,” he added. “Not all of it is going to work, and some of it will.” . Investors, excited by the aducanumab news, sent Biogen shares up 9.7 percent on Friday, and the company’s stock touched an all-time high of $480.18 during the session. . The small trial showed the treatment significantly slowed cognitive impairment in patients with mild symptoms, a rare bit of good news in a field littered with high profile failures from the likes of Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co . But some patients, especially those with a gene predisposing them to Alzheimer’s, developed localized brain swelling. The symptom was most common among patients with the gene who were receiving the highest doses of aducanumab, leading about 1/3 of the participants in that category to discontinue the treatment. The company said the swelling was generally “asymptomatic or with mild, transient symptoms.” . Biogen plans to begin a larger trial later this year. “If they can replicate the Alzheimer’s data in Phase III, they could conceivably have the biggest drug on the planet,” JMP Securities analyst Michael King said. As many as 75 million people are expected to develop the disease by 2030. . For Biogen, which is also working on Alzheimer’s drugs that use other mechanisms of action, research on dementia drugs represents an expansion of the company’s potential reach.  . “If the Alzheimer’s thing works, then we’re not just an MS company. We are broadly focused on neuro-degenerative diseases,” Scangos said. . The company is also developing a drug it hopes will address not just symptoms but the cause of MS, potentially changing the way the disease is treated. . “The future looks pretty exciting for us,” said Scangos, who became Biogen CEO in July 2010 following a period of upheaval in which activist investor Carl Icahn pushed for management changes and the sale of the company. Scangos, who previously led the tiny biotech firm Exelixis Inc, was recommended for the CEO post by Icahn lieutenants on the Biogen board. . As it works on new medicines for unmet needs, Biogen is also planning a bigger move into the fledgling field of biosimilars, manufacturing cheaper versions of older biotech drugs as they lose patent protection. Health regulators this month approved the first such drug for the U.S. market, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc’s white blood cell booster Neupogen. . Biogen previously disclosed plans to develop six biosimilar drugs in collaboration with Samsung. “We will expand that to include more,” Scangos said. . It has filed for European approval of biosimilars of two  blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drugs, Amgen’s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade. . Scangos shrugged off the potential impact to Biogen of biosimilars that replicate its own products, even though such competition could result in far cheaper alternatives to its drugs. . “I view biosimilars as a good thing,” he said. “When they come for our drugs, they come.”   . Biogen’s ambitions are not without risk. The company saw a “spectacular failure,” as Scangos put it, with a large trial of an ALS drug a few years ago, highlighting the challenge ahead. . “There was no effect at all,” Scangos said. “We’ve gone back to the drawing board.”  |Mon Mar 23 05:42:34 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Biogen shortens name, expands ambitions in Alzheimer's, ALS |5.798808980253614e+17|http://reut.rs/1xrntOC
Misha Hussain|DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The slow international response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak created an avoidable tragedy that cost thousands of lives, a leading medical charity said on the one year anniversary of the first confirmed case. . The world’s worst Ebola epidemic has killed over 10,200 people in the three most affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since March 2014 when it was first confirmed in the forest region of Guinea. . Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which first raised the alarm over Ebola, said in a report that everyone from national governments to the World Health Organization (WHO) had created bottlenecks that prevented the epidemic being quickly snuffed out. . “The Ebola outbreak has often been described as a perfect storm: a cross-border epidemic in countries with weak public health systems that had never seen Ebola before,” Christopher Stokes, MSF’s general director, said in the report. . “Yet this is too convenient an explanation. For the Ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail. And they did, with tragic and avoidable consequences.” . In a scathing report titled “Pushed to the limit and beyond”, MSF said its warnings in June that the epidemic was out of control and that it could not respond on its own were dismissed as alarmist. . Guinea and Sierra Leone downplayed the epidemic and accused MSF of spreading fear and panic. In June, the Sierra Leone government told the WHO to report only lab-confirmed deaths - falsely reducing the death toll, the report said. . Kenema hospital in the southeast, where some of the first cases were reported in Sierra Leone, also withheld crucial epidemiological data preventing MSF from identifying affected villages and responding, the report said. . “The Ministry of Health and the partners of Kenema hospital refused to share data or lists of contacts with us, so we were working in the dark while cases kept coming in,” MSF’s emergency coordinator in Sierra Leone, Anja Wolz, said in the report. . The governments of Guinea and Sierra Leone were contacted about the report by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, but did not comment.     . Liberia was transparent and asked for help almost on a daily basis. MSF, which reported this to the WHO in June, said the outbreak could have been halted if immediate action was taken, but these warnings were again ignored. . Isabelle Nuttall, director of the WHO’s Global Alert and Responses Network told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the height of the outbreak in September the WHO had been accused of crying wolf in the past. . In 2009, the WHO declared swine flu (H1N1) as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), prompting governments to stock up on swine flu vaccines. The pandemic was not as severe as predicted and cost governments hundreds of millions of dollars in unused medicine.     . Margaret Harris, WHO’s Ebola spokesperson in Geneva said that only after infected Liberian Patrick Sawyer traveled by air to Nigeria in late July could the WHO consider Ebola as a PHEIC. The announcement came on Aug. 8, prompting a global response.  . However, by then the pandemic had spiraled out of control, MSF said. The agency branded the response a “global coalition for inaction” and said by the end of August, it had to turn away patients in Liberia leaving many to die in their homes or on the streets. . “We had to make horrendous decisions about who we could let into the center,” said MSF coordinator Rosa Crestani, who worked at the organization’s Ebola center in Monrovia, which could only be opened for 30 minutes a day because of the demand for beds. . “We could only offer very basic palliative care and there were so many patients and so few staff that the staff had on average only one minute per patient. It was an indescribable horror.” . Internal differences also prevented MSF from working together and deploying faster, resulting in just one of MSF’s five operation units taking on the bulk of the response, Brice de la Vigne, head of operations for MSF Belgium, said in a telephone interview. . The number of Ebola cases dropped dramatically between November and January in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The presidents of all three countries announced a target to reach zero Ebola by mid-April. . However, Guinea recently reported a doubling of cases in a month, Sierra Leone has a whole neighborhood under quarantine and Liberia announced on Friday its first new case 16 days after its last Ebola patient was released. . The Ebola outbreak is not over until there are zero cases in the region for 42 days, said MSF.    |Mon Mar 23 00:31:57 +0000 2015||Slow Ebola response cost thousands of lives: MSF |5.798027310089257e+17|http://reut.rs/1xqYoDE
Chris Arsenault|ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Developing countries are pumping livestock full of antibiotics at such a startling rate that they are dramatically increasing the risk of creating drug-resistant “super bugs”, scientists warned on Monday.  . Antibiotic use in animals is expected to surge by two thirds globally between 2010 and 2030, while doubling in emerging giants like China, Brazil, India and Russia, according to a Princeton University study. . It warned that the practice is pushing us closer to a time when common infections could become a death sentence because they will no longer respond to drugs. . Consumption of meat, milk and eggs is growing fast in many developing and middle-income countries. . Urbanization, increased wealth and changing diets mean industrial livestock producers are expanding rapidly.  . They are relying on antibiotics to keep disease at bay in the short-term, said co-author Tim Robinson, a scientist with the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). . But the systematic use of low doses on livestock is creating “perfect conditions to grow resistant bacteria”, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . Bacteria like E. coli and salmonella are already becoming resistant to antibiotics, Robinson said, increasing fears that these diseases will endanger humans.  . Passed from animals to people through food contamination, direct contact or the broader environment, antibiotic resistant bacteria will make it harder for doctors to treat basic infections or other ailments, he said. . The study by experts from Princeton, ILRI and the National Institutes of Health is the first to measure global antibiotic consumption by livestock.      . Asia is the main region of concern as this is where demand for livestock products is growing dramatically while regulations governing antibiotic use in animals are either non-existent or not publicly available, scientists say.  . China’s livestock industry alone could soon be consuming nearly one third of the world’s antibiotics.  . The five countries with the largest projected increases in antibiotics consumption are Myanmar (205 percent), Nigeria (163 percent), Peru (160 percent) and Vietnam (157 percent).      . Increasing food production for the estimated 805 million people who go to bed hungry every night will require a new approach that is less reliant on intensive, antiobiotic-fueled breeding, Robinson said.      . “Poor livestock producers aren’t responsible for this problem, it’s the big firms rushing to meet demand in the growing cities,” he added.  . But the poor will be worst affected if resistant bacteria transfer to humans more often, he said, because they will be the least able to afford the bigger and more frequent doses of drugs required to fight infections.  |Mon Mar 23 00:31:57 +0000 2015||Soaring antibiotic use in animals fuels 'super bug' fears |5.798027288236892e+17|http://reut.rs/1xqYlYn
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The world’s most widely-used weed killer can “probably” cause cancer, the World Health Organization said on Friday. . The WHO’s cancer arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said glyphosate, the active ingredient in the Monsanto Co herbicide Roundup, was “classified as probably carcinogenic to humans”. . It also said there was “limited evidence” that glyphosate was carcinogenic in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  . Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, said scientific data do not support the conclusions and called on the WHO to hold an urgent meeting to explain the findings. . “We don’t know how IARC could reach a conclusion that is such a dramatic departure from the conclusion reached by all regulatory agencies around the globe,” Philip Miller, Monsanto’s vice-president of global regulatory affairs, said in a statement. . Concerns about glyphosate on food have been a hot topic of debate in the United States recently, and contributed to the passage in Vermont last year of the country’s first mandatory labeling law for foods that are genetically modified.    . The U.S. government says the herbicide is considered safe. In 2013, Monsanto requested and received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for increased tolerance levels for glyphosate. . Glyphosate is mainly used on crops such as corn and soybeans that are genetically modified to survive it.  . The weed killer has been detected in food, water and in the air after it has been sprayed, according to the report from the WHO agency. However, glyphosate use is generally low in and near homes where the general public would face the greatest risk of exposure, the report said. . The evidence for the WHO’s conclusion was from studies of exposure, mostly agricultural, in the United States, Canada, and Sweden that were published since 2001. . Carcinogens are substances that can lead to cancer under certain levels of exposure. . Monsanto’s stock price rose 0.3 percent on Friday to $115.75 after setting a four-month low on Thursday. |Fri Mar 20 23:49:54 +0000 2015||Monsanto weed killer can 'probably' cause cancer: World Health Organization |5.790673705613844e+17|http://reut.rs/1HbJCQM
Jessica Dye|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Philadelphia jury on Friday found that Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals failed to warn that antipsychotic drug Risperdal could cause male breast growth, in a case filed by a young man who had taken the drug, but it awarded no damages after finding no direct link to the man’s condition. . The verdict came after a month-long trial in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, according to Tom Kline of law firm Kline & Specter, who represented the plaintiff, William Cirba, 19, of Pennsylvania.  . It is the second verdict in litigation over Risperdal, which is the subject of nearly 1,300 lawsuits consolidated in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Last month, jurors hit Janssen with a $2.5 million verdict in a similar case.  . Risperdal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 to treat schizophrenia, but was not cleared for use in children until 2006. . Plaintiffs’ lawyers say that New Jersey-headquartered Janssen routinely promoted the drug for off-label use, particularly in the elderly and in children, for a range of conditions including oppositional defiance disorder, with which Cirba had been diagnosed.  . Cirba took Risperdal intermittently until 2007, according to Kline. His 2013 lawsuit said that taking the drug caused him to develop gynecomastia, a hormonal imbalance that leads to breast growth in men and boys. The lawsuit said Janssen knew about the risk but failed to warn doctors.  . A spokeswoman for Janssen, Michele Baer, said the company was pleased that jurors had found Risperdal did not cause Cirba’s injuries and that it stood behind the drug and would continue to defend it at trial.  . Kline said that while no damages had been awarded, the verdict was a “significant setback” for the company.  . “Within a month, Janssen has twice been found to have failed to warn physicians treating mentally disabled and adolescents of the risks of this powerful anti-psychotic drug,” he said. . Additional Risperdal trials are scheduled to take place in the coming months, Kline said.  . In 2013, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and several other drugs.  |Fri Mar 20 22:28:56 +0000 2015||J&amp;J's Janssen scores partial victory in second Risperdal trial |5.790469972163871e+17|http://reut.rs/1xn1Xus
Susan Cornwell|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Abortion politics in the U.S. Congress, already holding up a human trafficking bill and a key Obama administration nomination, are now also complicating bipartisan talks on a deal that would spare physicians from Medicare pay cuts. . Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and another senior Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden, say they’re worried that an emerging House of Representatives deal to rewrite Medicare’s flawed doctor-pay formula will include anti-abortion language. . One of the country’s most divisive issues, abortion has been a flashpoint in Congress for decades. Democrats on Friday expressed concern that Republicans may be mounting a renewed anti-abortion push. . Referring to an anti-abortion measure known as the “Hyde amendment,” Reid is concerned that “Republicans are trying to slowly but systematically expand the scope of Hyde,” Reid’s spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said on Friday. . The Hyde amendment bans federal funds from being used for abortions except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is in danger. . The amendment has been routinely attached to annual U.S. appropriations legislation since the 1970s. But some Democrats say they worry that Republicans are now trying to add it to unrelated bills in an effort to extend its impact. . Concern about the Medicare doctor-pay issue comes after a separate bill to increase penalties for human trafficking got mired down in the Senate this week because Democrats objected to anti-abortion language in it. The dispute over the  bill has blocked progress on Democratic President Barack Obama’s nomination of Loretta Lynch to be U.S. attorney general. . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he won’t call a vote to confirm Lynch until the human trafficking bill is done.  . The “doc fix” plan under discussion in the House would establish a new formula for paying Medicare doctors that would cost $200 billion over 10 years. The talks involve House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat. . The emerging House agreement would also include $7.2 billion for community health centers, which provide medical care for low-income Americans. This two-year extension of their funding  also would extend abortion restrictions currently in place at the centers, congressional aides said. . This concerned Reid as well as Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Wyden called the provision “a complete non-starter that has no place in a bill about access to care for America’s seniors and children.” . A “working framework” of the tentative Medicare pay deal, released on Friday, did not include the anti-abortion language, leaving the details unclear. . House leaders hope for a vote on the “doc fix” package next week, so they can send it to the Senate for action by April 1, when the current Medicare payment formula expires. . If Congress has not acted by then, hundreds of thousands of doctors who treat Medicare patients face a 21 percent cut in their reimbursements. |Fri Mar 20 21:48:18 +0000 2015||U.S. abortion politics snag effort to fix doctors' Medicare pay |5.79036768563028e+17|http://reut.rs/1HbfpRO
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Breast cancer patients of different races and ethnicities may not pick surgeons and hospitals in the same way, a new study suggests. . For example, black and Hispanic women with breast cancer were less likely than white women to select surgeons and hospitals based on reputation, researchers found.  . The differences in how people select healthcare providers may help explain racial differences in use, delivery and quality of medical care, the researchers write in JAMA Oncology. . “Disparities in breast cancer and cancer care are very complex,” said Dr. Rachel Freedman, the study’s lead author from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. . She and her colleagues asked 222 non-Hispanic white women, 142 non-Hispanic black women and 136 Hispanic women from Northern California to identify the reasons they chose their surgeons and hospitals. The women were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2010 and 2011. . Overall, most women said they chose their surgeon based on their doctors’ recommendations, and they picked their hospital because of their health plan. . On closer analysis, the researchers found 19 percent of black women and 87 percent of Spanish-speaking Hispanic women listed their doctors’ recommendations as a reason for selecting their surgeons, compared to 76 percent of white women. . Overall, they found that black and Hispanic women were less likely than white women to factor in the reputation of their surgeons and hospitals when making their choices. Minority women, however, more often said they factored in their doctors’ recommendations. . “We also noted that white women were more likely to select multiple reasons than one or two reasons for hospital or provider selections,” Freedman said. “We don’t know the reasons for that, but what that may suggest is that white women may be more active in selecting providers when determining their cancer care.” . While they can’t say how these differences factor into later care, Freedman said the recommendations from doctors may become very important and determine women’s remaining care. . “It possible that initial point of referral is very important for treatment and trajectory,” she said. . The next step would be to look at what kinds of care the women are getting to get a better understanding of how this all matters, Freedman said, adding that doctors may need to tailor their approaches for different women. . She said there may not be anything wrong with a more passive style of doctor and hospital selection they found among black and Hispanic women, she said. . “We just don’t know,” she said, adding that existing literature suggests people who are more active in healthcare are also more engaged. . “Not all patients operate that way and can still get good care,” Freedman said. .

Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - - Preemies often have lasting health issues and their parents often feel stressed, but a new study suggests parents might stay calmer if they had support in figuring out ways to deal with the behavioral challenges of these youngsters. . Parents of seven-year-olds who were born very preterm – seven or more weeks early - felt much more stressed than those with full-term children when the kids were acting out. But parents who used more constructive problem-solving for outbursts stayed calmer than their counterparts who used avoidance to cope. . “The full-term parents were better at using this form of coping than preterm parents,” said Mark Linden, the study’s first author and a lecturer in Health Sciences at the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Queen’s University, Belfast, UK. “This may have been one of the things which lead to parents of full-term children experiencing less stress.”	 . Mothers of children who act out already have higher stress levels and may play and interact with their children less than mothers whose kids behave, the researchers write in Archives of Disease in Childhood. Having a preemie with medical complications may just make those interactions worse.  . Linden noted that while survival rates for preemies have increased in recent years, preterm youngsters can have more disabilities. . “For parents of children who are born premature or with other medical complications, the joy of a new baby is tempered with worry,” Linden told Reuters Health in an email. “The medicalized environment in which the baby is placed in the days and weeks following delivery is unfamiliar and at times frightening for parents.” . To see what factors might predict whether parents of preterm babies would feel overly stressed even years later, the researchers looked at data from a larger long-term study of children in Vancouver, Canada. . They studied two groups, one with 50 boys and 50 girls born very preterm between 2001 and 2004, and the other with 20 boys and 30 girls born full-term during the same period.  . Researchers used various questionnaires to gauge parental stress and coping levels, as well as tools to measure children’s behavior and IQ, when the children were seven years old. . The full-term children had higher IQs at age seven than the preterm children, but patterns of misbehavior in both groups were similar. . After accounting for child behavioral problems, IQ, gender and the parents’ coping styles, the study found that parents were more likely to be stressed if their child acted out, if they avoided dealing with their child’s behavioral problems and if the youngster was a girl.  . Though parents reported more acting out by boys, mothers tended to avoid behavioral problems in their daughters more than in their sons.  . The authors say they can’t know whether the parents’ stress is a result of the children’s behavior problems, or a cause.  . “Their finding that there is a little bit more stress in the group of parents who had preterm infants was not such a surprise,” said Marsha Gerdes, a psychologist at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, “but I thought their addition of looking at coping strategies was a helpful thing.” . “The findings of this article really did ring true with me,” said Gerdes, who also co-directs her hospital’s Neonatal Follow-up Program and was not involved in the study. . Dr. Martha G. Welch, a psychiatrist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said her own research had also shown that preemies’ problems can “weigh heavily on families.” . “This is an important observational study by an excellent research group demonstrating for the first time the long-term risks for parents of preterm infants,” Welch told Reuters Health by email. “These children are themselves at great risk for problems in emotion regulation, attention, impulse control, school performance, as well as (autism spectrum disorder).” . Gerdes said parenting classes through pediatrians’ offices could help. “Oftentimes (parents are) more likely to participate in a parenting group if you say, ‘Right here in this location, Thursday night, we are have a parenting group,’ than if you gave them an agency miles away that does the same thing,” she said. “Because people tend to trust their pediatricians.” .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – - People can be so turned off by obese individuals that they actually imagine a bad smell, according to a new study.  . Study participants who were shown images of heavy and thin individuals while sniffing odorless substances rated the “scent samples” as smelling worse when they were paired with images of heavy people. . “Our findings suggest that people may hold negative views of heavy individuals that are sufficiently entrenched that they can cross over into olfactory (that is, smell) perceptions though people may not be aware that they hold such views,” senior author Andrew Ward told Reuters Health in an email. . “This is the first study to show that negative bias toward heavy individuals is sufficient to affect smell perception,” said Ward, a psychology researcher at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. . As reported in the International Journal of Obesity, Ward and his colleagues enrolled college students in two separate studies. In the first, 67 participants were shown twelve separate images – four heavy people, four thin people and four pictures of inanimate objects (the “distractor images”).  . While the participants viewed each image, a researcher placed the odorless sample under their noses. . Participants rated the “scents” paired with pictures of heavy people as lower than samples paired with thin pictures. But the findings weren’t completely clear due to the arrangement of the images, so the researchers repeated the study with additional distractor images. A total of 175 college students participated.  . Once again, the odorless samples paired with images of heavy individuals were rated as smelling worse than those paired with images of thin people. And that effect was most pronounced among study participants who were themselves heavy. . The extent of negative bias toward overweight individuals may be greater than previously assumed, the authors say.  . “Given how pervasive the bias might be, I think it’s important to make people aware of it, especially to the extent that individuals might not otherwise be able to explicitly recognize the bias in themselves,” Ward said. . Angela Meadows, a psychology researcher at the University of Birmingham in the UK who was not involved in the study, said the extent of negative bias toward heavier individuals is pretty well established.  . “They experience stigma and discrimination in just about every aspect of daily life - including healthcare, education, legal proceedings, personal relationships - even going shopping is fraught with potential and actual negative experiences,” Meadows told Reuters Health in an email. . “The world is not a friendly place for fat individuals,” said Meadows. . Meadows said most scientific attempts at improving the situation haven’t been very successful. . “Public health messages and the ‘War on Obesity’ aren’t helping because they frame the fat individual as the villain, and media representations of fat people are almost entirely negative,” she said.  . When this stigma is pointed out, Meadows added, people often respond by saying that if fat people don’t like being treated badly, they should lose weight.  . “Fat is one of the few stigmatized groups who are expected to change themselves in response to being bullied and harassed,” she pointed out. . Meadows said the current study adds to previous evidence showing how much heavier people dislike their bodies.  . “Common wisdom suggests that this could motivate them to change, but almost all the evidence points the other way,” she said. “Self-stigma is associated with more binge eating, less frequent exercise, and so on.” . Meadows said that more and more, research is showing that a positive body image is associated with more healthy behaviors, and better health and well being, even at larger body sizes. . SOURCE: .

|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia reported its first Ebola case in weeks on Friday, a woman whom authorities suspect may have contracted the virus through sexual intercourse with a survivor, in a setback to efforts to halt the outbreak in West Africa. . Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown said that a 44-year-old woman had been transferred to the ELWA Ebola treatment unit in the capital Monrovia after testing positive for the virus. . “Initial suspicion is that she may have contacted the virus through sexual intercourse with a survivor,” the minister said. . Liberia had not reported any new cases for a few weeks. However, health officials have warned that even after areas are declared free of the disease new cases are possible due to sexual transmission.  . A spokesman for Medecins Sans Frontieres, which runs the unit, confirmed that a patient had tested positive at a transit center in the government-run Redemption Hospital in Monrovia. . The Ebola outbreak, which began in eastern Guinea over a year ago, is the worst on record and has killed more than 10,200 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Guinea has recently reported a rash of new cases of the disease, which had appeared to be on the wane.       . In Liberia, the government had hoped to declare the country Ebola-free next month, 42 days after the last patient tested negative for a second time, which would mark double the length of the virus’s incubation period. . However, while the disease typically takes 15 to 21 days to run its course, traces of Ebola can remain in semen for around two months after recovery, so transmission by sexual intercourse would still pose a risk, health officials say. . Brown said that once the new case was detected on Friday, surveillance teams had been deployed to the woman’s neighborhood of Caldwell in Monrovia — not far from the last recorded cluster of cases in the St Paul’s Bridge suburb — to track down people who had come into contact with her. . Liberia had previously gone for 16 days without any new infections, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The government put the figure at 27 days without cases.  . It released its last known patient on March 5. . Monrovia became the epicenter of the outbreak in the middle of last year but since then hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and the deployment of U.S. troops have helped officials control the spread of the virus. |Fri Mar 20 18:28:15 +0000 2015||Liberia reports first Ebola case in weeks |5.789864254561608e+17|http://reut.rs/1xmCiSE
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Herds of African cattle may hold the secret to new ways of fighting parasitic diseases like malaria, which kills some 600,000 people a year, scientists said on Friday. . The researchers from the University of Edinburgh found that cows are protected from a parasite that causes a deadly disease called East Coast Fever if they have previously been infected with a closely-related but milder species of the parasite. . This discovery, they said, suggests that “fighting fire with fire” is a strategy that might work against a range of parasitic diseases, including severe malarial infection in people.  . “Our results suggest seeking a simple vaccine that could protect cows from East Coast fever by inoculating them with a related but far less harmful parasite,” said Mark Woolhouse, who led the study with a team from several other universities and the International Livestock Research Institute. . “A similar process might be at work in malaria, where infection with the less harmful Plasmodium vivax parasite may protect people from the Plasmodium falciparum parasite.” . Like the cattle disease East Coast fever, malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite, Plasmodium, although more than one species of Plasmodium can cause the disease.  . The deadliest species is Plasmodium falciparum, the most common in Africa and the cause of the vast majority of the world’s 600,000 malaria deaths a year. Plasmodium vivax is more common in Asia and more widespread but causes a less serious illness. . For their study, Woolhouse’s team tracked the health of 500 Kenyan calves from birth to one year old, building up data on the cattle’s survival, growth, health and infections with viruses, bacteria, worms and tick-borne parasites. . They found that deaths caused by East Coast Fever, the biggest killer of East African cattle, dropped 89 per cent among calves which were also infected with other species of parasite that do not cause disease. . Something similar may occur when people are infected with the more deadly parasite P. falciparum at the same time as the less aggressive P. vivax, making them more likely to survive the disease.  . “A better understanding of how this milder parasite may protect against the more lethal form of the disease could generate new approaches to reducing severe illness and deaths from malaria,” Woolhouse said. |Fri Mar 20 18:28:14 +0000 2015||Cattle parasite study points to possible way to fight malaria |5.789864227005235e+17|http://reut.rs/1Hair8Z
Emma Batha|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Ebola epidemic that has ravaged West Africa appears to have brought the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) to a near halt in Sierra Leone, a British minister said on Friday. . International development minister Lindsay Northover urged donors, aid agencies, campaigners and others to capitalize on the opportunity to make the break permanent. . “We are aware that at the moment with the Ebola crisis ... cutting has temporarily stopped,” Northover said. . “We have to seize this opportunity and see if we can move forward and end FGM,” she told a conference on FGM in London. . “I’ve talked to the head of DFID (Department for International Development) in Sierra Leone to see what she can do to build partnerships very, very rapidly to see if we can change attitudes.” . She said her counterparts at the U.S. development agency USAID were making a similar push in Liberia where the ancient and deeply entrenched practice also appears to have stopped. . Ebola, which is spread through infected bodily fluids, has killed more than 10,200 people — mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. . FGM involves the partial or total removal of the external genitalia and is often carried out in mass initiation ceremonies with many girls cut using the same blade. . The practice is legal in Sierra Leone but the government has introduced fines for FGM as part of its efforts to stamp out Ebola. . It has also imposed restrictions on travel and gatherings which would prevent people congregating for the festivals that accompany cutting ceremonies.   . FGM affects an estimated 140 million girls and women across a swathe of Africa and parts of the Middle East and Asia. In Sierra Leone some 88 percent of girls and women have been cut. . Communities which practise FGM see the ritual as a way of keeping girls pure and a gateway to marriage. . But Northover called FGM “one of the most extreme manifestations of gender inequality”. . “It’s a human rights violation that can result in a lifetime of physical, psychological and emotional suffering,” she added. . Britain has pledged to help eradicate FGM globally within a generation.  . However campaigners say it is difficult to tackle FGM in Sierra Leone and Liberia because the ritual is overseen by powerful secret societies which wield strong social clout. Girls are told they will die if they talk about being cut. . Helen Seeger, an aid worker with Plan UK who returned from Sierra Leone last month, said there was concern that girls who had not been cut this year would be cut next year. . But “the fact we have started to engage and have more access to secret societies means we have perhaps got a window of opportunity,” she said by phone. |Fri Mar 20 18:28:14 +0000 2015||Sierra Leoneans halt genital mutilation amid Ebola fears: UK minister |5.789864207291556e+17|http://reut.rs/1xmCiSG
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Most patients are willing to remind health care workers to wash their hands while in the hospital, suggests a new study from South Korea. . But many doctors and nurses don’t like the idea of patients telling them to clean up, the authors say. . “Hand hygiene is regarded as the most effective measure for preventing the spread of infection in health-care settings,” the authors write in the American Journal of Infection Control. “It is of primary importance to build a better understanding and to promote a facilitating environment for patient participation among patients and health care workers.” . Healthcare authorities already recommend patient participation to improve hand hygiene, but the authors said it’s unclear whether the idea is acceptable to either patients or health workers. . Dr. Min-Kyung Kim of the Seoul National University College of Medicine and colleagues surveyed 334 patients or family members, as well as 152 doctors and 387 nurses at one hospital in Seoul.  . They asked patients and families if they were aware of the importance of hand washing, if they wanted to or planned on asking health care workers about hand hygiene and why they wouldn’t want to ask about it.  . The researchers also asked doctors and nurses for their perceptions of the importance of hand hygiene, how often they washed their hands and reasons they didn’t, and how they felt about patient participation.  . Seventy-five percent of patients and 84 percent of their families wished to ask health care workers to wash their hands if they had not already washed them.   . But only 26 percent of doctors and 31 percent of nurses supported the idea that patients should ask them to wash their hands. The most common reason they disagreed with patient participation was concern about negative effects on relationships with patients.  . Other reasons included an increase in workload, patients’ lack of knowledge, concerns about legal problems and concern that their authority would be undermined.  . If patients were going to participate, then doctors and nurses would prefer to be asked directly to wash their hands. But patients and their families preferred to assess healthcare workers’ hand washing when they were discharged or periodically during their hospital stay, rather than asking health workers directly. . Dr. Nasia Safdar, who was not involved in the study, said that patients and providers agree hand hygiene is important, but they disagree on the best way to promote it.  . “Patient involvement and perceptions, as well as those of providers, are very culturally specific, so findings in one setting are not necessarily generalizable,” Safdar told Reuters Health in an email.  . Safdar, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin Department of Medicine, said she believes both doctors and patients would feel comfortable if the patients had the option of reminding staff to wash their hands. . Hand washing is “critical for the prevention of infection,” she added. . SOURCE: .

|BEIRUT (Reuters) - More than 550 kilograms of sanitary towels containing a radioactive substance were confiscated at Beirut international airport, officials said on Friday. . The Ministry of Finance said in statement that 30 cartons of confiscated pads will be sent to the Lebanese Atomic Energy Agency for checks before being returned to the exporter. . It declined to name the company that made the pads or the name of the substance, which was discovered by customs officers during regular checks on freight arriving at the airport. Officials did not say what level of radioactivity had been detected. . Customs officials, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to talk to the media, said that the sanitary towels were Chinese-made and delivered to Lebanon through Dubai. . There has been a public outcry in recent months over contaminated goods in Lebanon. A Ministry of Health inspection last year into food hygiene found that hundreds of restaurants, supermarkets and slaughterhouses had unsatisfactory hygiene conditions. . The uproar led to several restaurant closures and calls for stricter standards on imports and business practices. |Fri Mar 20 15:28:24 +0000 2015||Lebanon seizes half a ton of radioactive sanitary towels |5.789411651411231e+17|http://reut.rs/1H9nW7O
Misha Hussain|DAKAR, Mar 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The latest spike in Guinea’s Ebola cases could be a sign that aid teams are at last gaining access to hidden patients, rather than a surge of new cases, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said. . The number of suspected cases in the West African country has more than doubled from last month, according to the health ministry, prompting fears the epidemic could mushroom as it did in Liberia and Sierra Leone in September.   . However, Jean-Marie Dangou, the WHO’s Guinea country representative, said the uptick in cases was explained by previously hostile communities opening up to Ebola teams, mainly lead by the Red Cross. . “Unfortunately this has led to the discovery, not unexpected, of a large number of hidden cases and community deaths,” Dangou told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email. . “It also explains why most new cases are not linked to contacts under follow-up.”  . The worst Ebola outbreak in history, which has killed more than 10,000 people in West Africa, appears to be on the wane, especially in Liberia where there are no current cases. . But there is still resistance to the anti-Ebola effort in Guinea, which is struggling to control the outbreak and has overtaken Sierra Leone as the main hub for transmission. . The Red Cross intensified its campaign to win over suspicious locals in Guinea last month after the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported their Ebola teams were coming under increasingly violent attacks on a regular basis.  . Hostility toward Ebola aid workers has declined from 30 known areas of resistance in January to a handful of areas in the capital Conakry and the surrounding districts in March, according to incident mapping by the health ministry.  . However, some health workers involved in the Ebola response pin the rise in cases to a lack of resources and poor training. . Earlier this year, labs in Guinea botched more than 20 Ebola blood tests which led to the release of at least four positive patients, two of whom later died, health officials told Reuters.  . Stemming the spread of the virus in and around the crowded city of Conakry presents the biggest challenge, especially in the districts of Coyah and Forecariah that are the source of most chains of transmission, said Dangou.  . David Heymann, of Public Health England, who dealt with the Ebola outbreak in what was then Zaire in 1976 as well as subsequent epidemics in Africa, said the proven way to stop Ebola transmission is through isolation and knowledge. . “It doesn’t surprise me that in Liberia where there has been a much more intense Ebola information campaign, quarantine and a military intervention that the disease has been brought under control faster than in Guinea,” Heymann said by phone from London. . In an election year, Guinea President Alpha Conde has pledged to reach zero Ebola cases by mid-April, but has so far avoided quarantine measures or the foreign-backed military interventions used in Liberia and Sierra Leone. |Fri Mar 20 14:30:02 +0000 2015||Spike in Ebola in Guinea could reflect access to hidden patients |5.78926475002409e+17|http://reut.rs/1xmgpmm
Zeba Siddiqui|MUMBAI (Reuters) - The case of a Mumbai tailor cured of an extremely resistant form of tuberculosis this week has revived debate over a new drug to which the Indian government has limited access, prompting calls for change. . Dr Zarir Udwadia, the chest physician who treated the tailor, said the government needed to do a “a lot more” to control tuberculosis in India, home to the world’s largest number of TB patients.     . The government approved the drug bedaquiline in January for about 500 patients under a national TB control program. It is intended for patients with an extremely resistant form of the infection and are immune to existing drugs.  . But it has no plans yet to make the drug available to the private sector, which is where more than half of the 3 million afflicted with the deadly infection go for treatment.  . “They are starting with the pilot study (on bedaquiline), but you know what? Our plans can take forever. And till then, people are dying,” Udwadia said. . Experts say the government is hesitant to allow the drug’s wider use as a lack of supervision, incorrect diagnostics and mismanagement of drugs are commonplace in the private sector. . Such mismanagement can result in patients developing resistance, which Soumya Swaminathan, Director of India’s National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, said was a major risk. “The idea is to control the use of these new TB drugs, because there are very few of them,” she said. . Swaminathan said that was why the government would introduce the drug to only about four to five public sector hospitals across the country and decide on expanding access after reviewing data from initial patients.  . That would, however, delay the drug’s access for many. . India has about 100,000 drug-resistant TB patients. Udwadia procured bedaquiline, made by U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson Inc, for his patient on “compassionate grounds,” before the Indian government approved its use.  . Bedaquiline, the first new TB treatment in more than 40 years, got U.S. approval in 2012 for use on drug-resistant TB. . In 2013, the European Medicines Agency recommended  conditional marketing approval for delamanid, another new treatment for multi drug-resistant TB by Japan’s Otsuka. Otsuka has not yet applied to the Indian regulator for approval.  . Activists and NGOs, including the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, have been campaigning for expanding access to these new TB drugs. . Critics say India’s national tuberculosis control program has failed to adequately address the country’s disease burden. Fewer than half of the TB patients in India are treated successfully every year, according to the World Health Organization.  |Fri Mar 20 14:30:01 +0000 2015||New drugs still out of reach for most in India, world TB hotspot |5.789264729807503e+17|http://reut.rs/1H961hr
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - An experimental drug from Biogen Idec Inc became the  first Alzheimer’s treatment to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce what is believed to be brain-destroying plaque in patients with early and mild forms of the disease, according to a small study likely to reignite hopes of a treatment. . Alzheimer’s affects 15 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to grow to 75 million by 2030 without effective treatments, likely costing billions of dollars year. . Any effective treatment is likely to become one of the world’s most lucrative drugs, but the Biogen drug faces years of testing and would not reach the market much before 2020, even if all goes well, analysts said. . Biogen shares were up 6.5 percent, or $27.97, at $461.92 in morning trading, after rising as high as $480.18. . Biogen is entering a field littered with expensive failures from such drug makers as Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co. Lilly and Roche Holding AG are both conducting trials on drugs that work the same way as Biogen’s, by blocking beta amyloid, a protein that forms toxic brain plaques that are theoretically an underlying cause of the degenerative brain disease.   . It marks the first time an experimental drug demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in amyloid plaque as well as  a slowing of clinical impairment in patients with mild disease, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer. . “It’s a bigger treatment effect than we had hoped for,” Sandrock said. . The trial of the Biogen drug, aducanumab, tested 166 people divided into five groups, four of which each received a different dose, and a fifth that received a placebo.  . The Biogen treatment led to reductions in brain amyloid, according to interim data presented at a medical meeting in Nice, France, on Friday. The plaque reduction was more pronounced as the dose of the drug increased and over time. . Biogen will begin enrolling patients later this year for a large Phase III trial, whose results could be used to seek approval of its drug.  . Lilly’s solanezumab, a drug for patients with mild Alzheimer’s, has been in late-stage trials since 2013, with results expected late in 2016, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. He said the Biogen late-stage trial would not wrap up until 2019.  . Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said by email, “The magnitude of the efficacy improvements is really striking.” The trial had safety issues and drop outs, particularly by those on high doses, he said, and he wondered if some comparative success to Lilly may be related to trial design. . Biogen said it increased its chances of success by carefully screening patients to exclude those with other forms of dementia misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s, and by testing only those early in the disease.  . “We imaged every patient coming into study, so we knew that every patient had Alzheimer’s disease and plaque,” Biogen Chief Executive George Scangos said in an interview. “It’s hard to think of a reason why these data are not representative of the actual activity of the drug.” . Safety and tolerability were considered acceptable, the company said. There was a big jump in the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E), or water surrounding brain tissue, at the two higher doses among patients with a gene associated with the highest risk for developing Alzheimer’s. These highest-risk patients also dropped out of the trial at a higher rate. Most of the ARIA-E was asymptomatic or mild and resolved over time, Sandrock said.   . Using imaging to measure amyloid in six regions of the brain, researchers found plaque levels were virtually unchanged at 26 and 54 weeks into the study for the placebo group.  . Patients who received either 3 milligrams per kilogram of weight, 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of aducanumab showed a significant and dose-dependent increase in plaque reduction at 26 weeks. There was an even greater reduction in plaque for patients at the 3 mg and 10 mg doses when they were tested at 54 weeks.  . Data for those in the 6 mg arm was not available at 54 weeks because that group started later. A fourth group of patients who received a 1 mg dose were not helped by the drug.     . The trial also used two measures to test cognition: a questionnaire with a 30-point scale to test mental acuity and an 18-point Clinical Dementia Rating scale that also tests for loss of ability to function. . On the first test, placebo patients worsened by 3.14 points after one year versus significantly smaller declines for patients receiving aducanumab 3 mg and 10 mg, of 0.75 and 0.58 points, respectively.  . On the second scale, the placebo group worsened by 2.04 points at one year. While the scores were better for all the drug groups, only the 10 mg dose reached statistical significance, with a decline of 0.59 points. The 6 mg dose could still show a significant slowing on both scales when more data becomes available. |Fri Mar 20 14:30:01 +0000 2015||Biogen's Alzheimer's drug slows mental decline in early study |5.789264706026045e+17|http://reut.rs/1xmgqqs

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Professional baseball players may not be fully recovered when they return to play after a concussion, a new study suggests.  . Researchers found that in the first weeks of play after time off for a concussion, major league players performed worse than players coming back from non-medical leaves of absence. . “One of the things we’re always trying to understand is what is the impact of concussion on anything someone does,” said Dr. Jeffrey Bazarian, the study’s senior author and a concussion expert at the University of Rochester in New York. . Unlike other sports and activities where concussions are common, Bazarian told Reuters Health in a phone interview that baseball provides researchers with a unique opportunity. . “The thing that’s nice about baseball is that there are so many statistics kept on each player,” he said, adding that they can see how a player performs before and after a leave of absence. . For the study, published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, the researchers used information on Major League Baseball (MLB) players from a performance database and disabled list records. They found 66 concussions from 2007 through 2013 after eliminating players with missing data, repeat injuries or leaves longer than 35 days. There were 68 times players took bereavement or paternity leave. . Players with concussions were off the field for an average of about 11 days, compared to an average of about five days for those out on bereavement or paternity leave. . After accounting for the players’ performance before their leaves, their playing positions and the time they spent off the field, the researchers found that players with concussions performed worse in the two weeks following their return, compared to those out on leave. . For example, the batting average, which is the number of hits a player has divided by their number of times at bat, was 0.235 for players returning from concussion, compared to 0.266 for players returning from bereavement or paternity leave. . “We would speculate that the concussion affects a few brain pathways involved with the skill of hitting a ball coming at you at 90 miles per hour,” Bazarian said, adding that it may affect tracking the ball and upper body and head coordination. . MLB’s current concussion protocol includes neurological testing for athletes before the season to compare with test results after concussions. It also includes a seven-day disabled list for concussions and protocols for allowing players to return to play. . “We feel that the fact that the rate of concussion is very low in Major League Baseball and most people don’t return to the disabled list after they’ve been clear is pretty good,” said Dr. Gary Green, MLB’s medical director. “We also track these people when they return to play to make sure they’re not experiencing any symptoms.” . Green, who was not involved in the new study, also pointed out several issues that may affect the study’s results, including vast differences between the two groups in the number of days missed and the positions played. Also, he said, the databases used for the study may not accurately capture what is and is not a concussion. . “The problem with the paper is it has major methodological flaws that prevent it from having a whole lot of value,” said Green, who is also a sports medicine expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. . He also said that it’s in the teams’ best interest to make sure their players are delivering their best performances. . “Why would a team put a guy out there if they’re not going to be performing at their highest level,” he noted. . Bazarian and his colleagues suggest in their paper that current tests may not be sensitive enough to pick up lingering issues that affect accuracy on the field. . “This is a great example where we think people are recovered and they may not be,” Bazarian said. . The researchers can’t say whether the players, if they are not fully recovered, are harmed by returning to the field with some lingering problems stemming from the concussion. . “That’s really the implication for not just Major League Baseball, but college baseball and high school baseball,” Bazarian said. “We need to do more research to figure that out.” .

|STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish authorities said on Friday they had discovered H5N8 bird flu in two dead swans, the same strain of the virus that has been found in several countries across Europe in recent months. . The Swedish Board of Agriculture said it would not raise the bird flu alert level because of the discovery, saying the swans had probably died from other causes even though they carried the virus. The alert level is currently at its lowest in Sweden. . “This is not really unexpected since we have had several cases in Europe during the autumn and the winter,” a board spokesman told Reuters. . Since November, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain and Italy have all been hit by the H5N8 bird flu strain. The strain has devastated poultry flocks in Asia but has never been detected in humans. |Fri Mar 20 12:41:55 +0000 2015||Sweden investigating possible bird flu case: agriculture board |5.78899268615934e+17|http://reut.rs/1H8zqZ9
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization warned on Friday of a risk of outbreaks of measles, whooping cough and other diseases in West African countries hit by Ebola and urged a rapid intensification of routine immunizations. . The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 10,200 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and has reduced vaccination coverage as health clinics and healthcare workers focused on fighting the unprecedented outbreak. . In recent months, Ebola has started to wane with the number of cases falling significantly, though a spike in Guinea this week has also highlighted the risk of complacency. . The epidemic has disrupted delivery of routine childhood vaccines against measles, polio and tuberculosis, and of a combined shot against meningitis, pneumonia, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B and diphtheria. . Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, the WHO’s vaccines director, told a briefing in Geneva that the health agency wanted an intensification of immunization services, and mass measles vaccination campaigns in all areas where feasible. . “Campaigns will only be conducted in areas that are free of Ebola virus transmission,” he said, stressing that clinics and health workers administering vaccines would be required to adhere to very strict infection control measures.     . The WHO sent a warning note to affected countries this week saying: “Any disruption of immunization services, even for short periods ... will increase the likelihood of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.” . A study published last week by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States warned that measles cases could almost double in countries hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak.  . The researchers calculated that for every extra month that healthcare systems were disrupted, up to 20,000 children aged between nine months and five years were put at risk. . Measles is a viral disease which killed around 146,000 people globally in 2013, mostly children under five, according to latest data. That equated to almost 17 deaths every hour. . One of the most transmissible diseases, outbreaks of measles often follow humanitarian crises as vaccination campaigns falter and populations are displaced and impoverished. . Okwo-Bele said the WHO had received reports of around 500 measles cases so far this year in the three countries, with at least three deaths. . Edward Kelley, the WHO’s director of service delivery and safety, said the focus on boosting vaccination coverage rates was “part of the early recovery work (as the Ebola outbreak wanes) and one of the very pressing recovery pieces that needs to get done.” |Fri Mar 20 12:41:55 +0000 2015||WHO urges mass vaccination against measles, other diseases in Ebola areas |5.7889926683759e+17|http://reut.rs/1xm6WM6
|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Merck KGaA will promote its deputy chief executive, Stefan Oschmann, to the top job next year to replace Karl-Ludwig Kley, Manager Magazin reported on Friday, citing company sources. . The publication said Oschmann, 57, would take on the new role after the group’s annual shareholder meeting in April 2016 or in September next year at the latest, when Kley’s current contract expires. . The German drugs and chemicals maker last September appointed Oschmann, the head of its pharma business at the time, as deputy chief executive from January, sharing strategic management functions and representation of the company with Kley, who is 63. . A Merck spokeswoman said a decision on Kley’s succession has not yet been made and that this would be a matter for the family-controlled group’s board of partners. She declined to comment further. . Merck, which is also the world’s largest maker of liquid crystals for flat-panel displays, is buying Sigma-Aldrich, putting it on track to become the world’s second-largest lab supplies maker after Thermo Fisher. . Before joining Merck KGaA in 2011, German-born Oschmann was in charge of Merck & Co Inc’s emerging markets operations. The two companies share historic roots but are under separate ownership since World War One. |Fri Mar 20 12:10:11 +0000 2015||Merck KGaA's deputy chief Oschmann set to become CEO: Manager Magazin |5.788912822795018e+17|http://reut.rs/1xm3bX0

Shelby Sebens|PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - A sixth University of Oregon student has contracted the potentially deadly meningococcal disease amid an outbreak that erupted in January, and more cases could emerge, public health officials said on Thursday. . Health officials said a 20-year-old college sophomore who lives off campus has been confirmed as having contracted meningococcemia, a bacterial precursor to meningitis that can also lead to damaging blood infections. . The student, who has not been named, was in stable condition and was expected to recover, according to Lane County Public Health officer Patrick Luedtke. . Five other students have contracted meningococcal disease since January, including an 18-year-old freshman, Lauren Jones, who died. Three of the stricken students recovered and are back on campus while a fourth suffered severe complications but is planning to return to school, health officials said.  . Health officials are asking parents to urge students at the school in Eugene to get vaccinated over spring break. About 9,000 out of the university’s 22,000 students have been vaccinated, officials said.  . “That leaves quite a few students still at risk. It wouldn’t surprise me at all to see more cases of meningococcal disease,” said Paul Cieslak, medical director of infectious disease and immunization programs at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division. . The university quickly notified classmates and roommates of the latest student who contracted the disease, university spokeswoman Julie Brown said. The university health center and local pharmacies are providing vaccinations. . “No one should be complacent about this disease. University of Oregon undergraduates who have not been vaccinated are at risk of infection, serious illness and death,” Cieslak said in a statement.  . But health officials said they are not suggesting all Lane County residents get vaccinated, and that the risk to the broader public was low, because the disease requires hours of close personal contact to spread. . Reactions to the disease vary, with some people recovering quickly while others experience more severe complications that could include deafness, loss of digits because of blood clots, and even death, officials said.   |Thu Mar 19 21:25:09 +0000 2015||Sixth Oregon college student stricken by meningococcal disease |5.786685540080271e+17|http://reut.rs/1xkiUWp
Toni Clarke|(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s drug to treat chronic breathing problems is safe and effective enough for adults with asthma to use but not adolescents, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Thursday. . The panel voted 16-4 that Breo Ellipta should be approved for once daily treatment of asthma in adults 18 years and older. It voted 19-1 that the data did not support approval for use in children aged 12 to 17. . The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Glaxo licensed the product from Theravance Inc in 2002. . The drug consists of a corticosteroid, which reduces inflammation, and a long-acting beta-agonist, or LABA, called vilanterol, which is designed to open the airways. . The LABA class of drugs has been linked in the past with asthma-related deaths, though there were no asthma-related deaths in studies of Breo Ellipta reviewed by the FDA. . Timothy Anderson, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research report that children represent about 10 percent of the eligible population for the drug. Even so, the company’s inability to market it for children “will have certain commercial implications,” he added. . Anderson said insurance companies will need to include more than one LABA/corticosteorid on their formulary to meet the needs of the total asthma population, when most would prefer just one agent. . In addition, he said, competitors will be quick to rally behind a “one drug meets all” approach. He predicts $750 million in Breo sales in 2020. . The panel vote came after the U.S. market closed. Anderson said he expects Theravance stock to fall Friday morning to between $13-$15 a share from $17.97 on Thursday. . The panel recommended that a large safety trial be conducted similar to others being conducted for drugs in the same class, including Glaxo’s Advair, AstraZeneca’s Symbicort and Merck & Co’s Dulera and Foradil, in both adolescents and adults. . Breo Ellipta is an inhaled treatment that has already been approved to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, a condition that includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both. . Darrell Baker, head of Glaxo’s global respiratory franchise, said the company’s aim is to work with the FDA and “answer any outstanding questions to enable them to make a fully informed decision.” . The FDA is expected to rule on whether to approve the drug by April 30, 2015. |Thu Mar 19 21:07:16 +0000 2015||FDA panel backs Glaxo asthma drug for adults, not adolescents |5.786640560783606e+17|http://reut.rs/1xkgw1T
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - - Installing devices in new cars to prevent drunk drivers from starting the engine could prevent 85 percent of alcohol-related deaths on U.S. roads, saving tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars from injury-related costs, according to a new analysis. . Over 15 years, as older cars without a so-called alcohol ignition interlock come off the roads, sobriety-screening systems in new vehicles could avert more than 59,000 crash fatalities, more than 1.25 million non-fatal injuries and over $340 billion in injury-related costs, the study in the American Journal of Public Health concludes.  . “Alcohol interlocks are used very effectively in all 50 states as a component of sentencing or as a condition for having a license reinstated after DUIs, but this only works for the drunk drivers caught by police and it doesn’t catch the people who choose to drive without a license to avoid having the interlock installed,” said lead author Dr. Patrick Carter, an emergency physician with the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor.  . Most drunk drivers make about 80 trips under the influence before they are stopped for a DUI, Carter said. “If we decided that every new car should have an alcohol ignition interlock that’s seamless to use for the driver and doesn’t take any time or effort, we suddenly have a way to significantly reduce fatalities and injuries that doesn’t rely solely on police.”  . Carter and colleagues used U.S. records of traffic accidents and fatalities to determine how many involved drunk driving and then estimated how many of these incidents could be avoided in the future by fitting new cars with alcohol-interlock devices, which detect blood-alcohol levels and prevent drivers above a certain threshold from starting the car. . Then, they estimated the numbers of deaths and injuries that could be prevented in the first year that all new cars sold had screening systems, and assumed it would take 15 years for older models to be replaced with new vehicles.  . Over the 15-year implementation period, interlocks may eliminate about $343 billion in costs from fatalities and injuries related to drunk driving, the researchers estimate. Assuming the device costs $400 per vehicle and is 100 percent accurate, the interlock would pay for itself after three years by way of avoided injury costs.  . “The technology is at this point pretty strong, and when implemented at a population level will be negligible in terms of the sticker price of a car,” said Jacob Nelson, director of traffic safety advocacy and research for AAA. To be widely adopted, it will need to be a rapid test that’s reliable and doesn’t inconvenience drivers, added Nelson, who wasn’t involved in the study. . The screening tool to do this is still in development, and may not be road-ready for another five to eight years, said Dr. Bud Zaouk, who is working to develop the technology, known as the driver alcohol detection system for safety, or DADSS. It would prevent a car from moving if the driver has a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or greater - the legal limit in all 50 states - and could be set to zero for drivers under the legal drinking age. . “Unlike the alcohol ignition interlocks which require you to blow into a devise and are used for convicted drunk drivers, DADSS is a driver assist system that would be seamless, take less than half a second, and use infrared light to measure a driver’s blood alcohol content in the breath or through the fingertips, which is far more reliable,” said Zaouk, DADSS Program Manager and Group Director for QinetiQ North America, who wasn’t involved in the study. . Getting DADSS into all vehicles can eliminate the element of chance involved in catching drunk drivers under our current system that relies on police, said Adrian Lund, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  . “It’s so hard to catch everybody,” said Lund, who wasn’t involved in the study. “With this, we can stop them from driving in the first place, and we can catch a broader group of people who are getting behind the wheel because they think they’re not impaired.” .

|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Residents in Sierra Leone’s remaining Ebola hotspots will be confined to their houses for three days next week, officials said, as the government tries to snuff out an outbreak that has killed over 10,200 people across West Africa. . The number of Ebola cases in the region has fallen in recent months, though a spike in Guinea highlights the risk of complacency, over a year into the worst outbreak on record. . Sidi Yaya Tunis, an official at Sierra Leone’s National Ebola Response Centre, said health officials would carry out house-to-house searches from March 27-29 to identify the sick in the north and west, where the virus is spreading fastest.  . Elsewhere, where transmission is lower, officials will focus on education and prevention, he said. . Health officials said a previous lockdown in Sierra Leone in September was a success and helped identify more than 100 cases. . “If we don’t get on top of this before the rains come, it will be a horror show,” said a Sierra Leone health official who asked not to be named because the details of the lockdown have not been made public. “Many people are still not following the basic rules.” . The rains are due to begin in May. The World Health Organization has said they could greatly complicate the fight against Ebola by washing away roads and making it harder for aid and healthcare workers to get to affected areas.     . The official said that residents would be allowed out to attend church on Palm Sunday for a few hours. . The latest figures issued by the WHO showed that there had been 10,216 confirmed, probable and suspected deaths from Ebola in West Africa. . Regional leaders have set themselves a target to completely stamp out the disease by mid-April. Ebola outbreaks in Nigeria, Mali and Senegal have been contained. . Liberia has recorded the most deaths with 4,283 since the crisis began, according to the WHO. However, there are currently no confirmed cases in the country.  . Sierra Leone has been the next worst affected country with 3,702 dead.  . Guinea, where the outbreak was first identified, has recorded 2,231 confirmed and probable deaths from Ebola but has seen a recent spike, with the number of patients more than doubling since last month. |Thu Mar 19 20:28:53 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone to lock down Ebola hotspots next week: officials |5.786543964326584e+17|http://reut.rs/1xk7X7m
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – - Professional baseball players may not be fully recovered when they return to play after a concussion, a new study suggests.  . Researchers found that in the first weeks of play after time off for a concussion, major league players performed worse than players coming back from non-medical leaves of absence. . “One of the things we’re always trying to understand is what is the impact of concussion on anything someone does,” said Dr. Jeffrey Bazarian, the study’s senior author and a concussion expert at the University of Rochester in New York. . Unlike other sports and activities where concussions are common, Bazarian told Reuters Health in a phone interview that baseball provides researchers with a unique opportunity. . “The thing that’s nice about baseball is that there are so many statistics kept on each player,” he said, adding that they can see how a player performs before and after a leave of absence. . For the study, published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, the researchers used information on Major League Baseball (MLB) players from a performance database and disabled list records. They found 66 concussions from 2007 through 2013 after eliminating players with missing data, repeat injuries or leaves longer than 35 days. There were 68 times players took bereavement or paternity leave. . Players with concussions were off the field for an average of about 11 days, compared to an average of about five days for those out on bereavement or paternity leave. . After accounting for the players’ performance before their leaves, their playing positions and the time they spent off the field, the researchers found that players with concussions performed worse in the two weeks following their return, compared to those out on leave. . For example, the batting average, which is the number of hits a player has divided by their number of times at bat, was 0.235 for players returning from concussion, compared to 0.266 for players returning from bereavement or paternity leave. . “We would speculate that the concussion affects a few brain pathways involved with the skill of hitting a ball coming at you at 90 miles per hour,” Bazarian said, adding that it may affect tracking the ball and upper body and head coordination. . MLB’s current concussion protocol includes neurological testing for athletes before the season to compare with test results after concussions. It also includes a seven-day disabled list for concussions and protocols for allowing players to return to play. . “We feel that the fact that the rate of concussion is very low in Major League Baseball and most people don’t return to the disabled list after they’ve been clear is pretty good,” said Dr. Gary Green, MLB’s medical director. “We also track these people when they return to play to make sure they’re not experiencing any symptoms.” .

Ransdell Pierson|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday denied Amgen Inc’s bid to block the sale of Novartis AG’s recently approved “biosimilar” form of Neupogen, Amgen’s blockbuster drug used to prevent infections in cancer patients.  . The drug, Zarxio, contains the same active ingredient as Amgen’s $1.2 billion-a-year Neupogen, and once launched, would become the first biosimilar in the United States. . Kristen Davis, a spokeswoman for Amgen, said in an emailed statement that the company plans to appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg of San Francisco federal court. . The judge denied Amgen’s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Novartis’ Sandoz unit from launching its copycat drug. Swiss drugmaker Novartis previously agreed to delay its U.S. launch until the court’s decision on the preliminary injunction, or until April 10, whichever came first. . It was not immediately clear how long Amgen’s appeal would take, or whether Novartis might launch its biosimilar before an appeals court decision is rendered. If Novartis were to initiate such an “at-risk” launch, it might later have to pay costly damages in the event that Amgen’s patent is declared valid and enforceable by the appeals court. . “Given the importance of this case for future biosimilars, we agreed with Amgen before this hearing to jointly request expedited review of any appeal to the Federal Circuit,” Novartis said in an emailed statement on Thursday.  . Because biosimilars are made in living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates of original brands. Insurers are hoping that biosimilars will be sold for discounts of 40 to 50 percent from the cost of original brands in the United States, but Novartis has not yet disclosed the intended U.S. price for Zarxio. Biosimilars have been on the market since 2006 in Europe. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March approved Zarxio for the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used - among cancer patients undergoing various treatments. |Thu Mar 19 20:13:20 +0000 2015||U.S. judge rejects Amgen bid to block biosimilar Neupogen |5.78650480496214e+17|http://reut.rs/1BD1n6L
|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. healthcare worker who was admitted to the biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medicine on Sunday has been released after testing negative for Ebola, the hospital said on Thursday. . The worker is one of 17 individuals brought back to the United States from Sierra Leone after being monitored for possible exposure to the virus. All had contact with an infected co-worker in Sierra Leone who is being treated for Ebola at the National Institutes of Health biocontainment facility in Maryland. . The person in Nebraska is one of five who are being housed near the facility in case they develop symptoms. On Sunday, one individual became ill and was transferred to the biocontainment unit, but those symptoms resolved on Monday. . The individual has returned to a housing facility near the medical center where the four other individuals are being monitored for the remainder of the 21-day Ebola incubation period. . Officials did not release any details on the healthcare worker. |Thu Mar 19 19:10:08 +0000 2015||Healthcare worker in Nebraska tests negative for Ebola |5.786345762323866e+17|http://reut.rs/1BCNUfa
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - People with ears that stick out may feel self-conscious about how others perceive them. According to a new study, though, strangers do notice the ears but don’t make negative personality judgments based on them. . It was very surprising to find no such bias, according to senior author Dr. Abel-Jan Tasman of the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen, Switzerland. . “Looking closer, though, we realized that the ‘bad cases’ with the obviously most protruding ears, the longest visual dwell time on the ears and the largest difference in dwell times between uncorrected and corrected auricles all looked cute and smart in their own way,” he told Reuters Health by email. . Children develop a sharpened awareness of small differences between themselves and others, and bullying for different looks begins after the age of five or six, Tasman said. . Parents’ fear that protruding ears lead others to make conscious or unconscious assumptions about personality is often behind decisions to alter a child’s ears surgically, Tasman and colleagues write in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery. . To see how much people really notice protruding ears and if seeing them triggers any biased assumptions about personality, the surgeons had 20 adult volunteers look at pictures of 20 children aged five to 19. All the children’s parents had requested corrective plastic surgery for protruding ears. . The researchers also digitally altered the same pictures to make the ears sit closer to the head, and showed the images to the volunteers.  . The observers rated the kids in all the images on 10 personality traits by scoring them on a scale of one to 10 representing pairs of opposite extremes, such as friendly-unfriendly, creative-uninspired and honest-dishonest. . People did spend more time looking at ears that stick out compared to digitally altered ears. But they rated the kids equally assiduous, intelligent and likeable regardless of ear type. . In fact, when people spent the most time focusing on protruding ears in the unaltered photographs, and those images scored higher on assiduousness, likeability and intelligence than the doctored images. . Four of the five kids with the most protruding ears actually scored lower on the personality scale with corrected images. . “In these, the protruding ears may have added to their cuteness,” Tasman said. . Deviation from socially accepted “norms” in appearance leads to penalties in perceived attractiveness, according to Dr. Lisa E. Ishii of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study. . In her own research, Ishii told Reuters Health by email, “we showed that a crooked nose, independent of other facial changes, caused an attractiveness penalty that was restored with straightening the nose.” . She was surprised that there seemed to be no such bias for kids with protruding ears, at least for personality traits, although the authors did not strictly assess attractiveness. . “However, we have not performed experiments with photos of children, and the way adults perceive children with ‘abnormalities’ is probably different than how they perceive other adults with the same abnormalities,” she said. “It is also probably different than how children view other children with same.” . Looking at pictures of faces on a monitor may not be the same as looking at a person in real life, the study authors note. . This was a small pilot study, not large enough to draw general conclusions, said Ishii, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. . Cultural context is important as well, Tasman said. In western cultures ‘dumbo ears’ may look funny to some, but in some eastern cultures large ears are considered a sign of vitality and longevity, he said. . In Switzerland, cosmetic surgery to correct protruding ears is one of the most common facial plastic surgeries for children, he said. . “The procedure has a very high social acceptance in western Europe, to the point of most health insurances in Switzerland (and probably elsewhere) covering part of the costs, when they should not, strictly speaking, cover costs of purely esthetic procedures,” Tasman said. . “It helps to know that lop ears catch the eye, but not necessarily the imagination in a negative way,” he said. “We counsel parents that way now.” .

Roxanne Nelson|(Reuters Health) – - Girls whose mothers smoked while pregnant entered puberty at a younger age in a new Australian study. . Since early menstruation is linked to higher risk of uterine, endometrial and breast cancers later in life, the researchers say that maternal smoking could set up daughters for health problems even before they’re born. . “The real take home message of this study is that we have probably just hit the tip of the iceberg in terms of understanding just how harmful smoking during pregnancy can be on the child,” said lead author Alison Behie, a biological anthropologist at Australian National University in Canberra. . Behie notes that the potential effects of smoking during pregnancy have been known for a long time, and can show up at birth or later on in childhood and adolescence. Health risks children may face when mothers smoke during pregnancy include low birth weight, asthma, type 2 diabetes and obesity, according to Behie.   . But recent research is beginning to reveal how some effects may evolve over the very long term and have an impact well into adulthood. . “This study not only highlights the risk of reproductive cancers for daughters of women who smoke in pregnancy but suggests why this might occur at a biological level,” she told Reuters Health in an email. “The behaviors and condition of mothers during pregnancy are extremely important for the health of their children long into the future.” . For the new study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, the researchers evaluated data on almost 1,500 girls that included information about their mothers’ smoking history and followed the girls from birth until they were 12 to 13 years old. At the time of the last interviews included in the analysis, 845 girls had started menstruating. . Behie’s team found several factors that influenced the age at which the girls would experience their first period: The mother’s age at her first period, the body weight of the girl when she was eight or nine years old, the girl’s birth weight and the mother’s cigarette smoking during pregnancy. . Smoking during pregnancy was a significant factor, the researchers report, only if the mother smoked on “most days,” and not just occasionally. The daughters exposed to regular smoking in utero were about 40 percent more likely than girls of non-smoking mothers to have an early age of first menstruation. . Girls who were heavy at age eight or nine were about 12 percent more likely than normal-weight girls to have early menstruation.  . In addition, girls whose weight at birth was low – something also associated with smoking during pregnancy – were about 14 percent more likely than normal-birthweight girls to have early menstruation. . The researchers accounted for each of these factors when calculating the influence of the others. Still, the associations do not prove cause and effect and the study team acknowledges that more research is needed to understand how the effects of maternal smoking might unfold. . Other studies have shown that a variety of mental and physical stresses a mother experiences while pregnant can affect her developing fetus, leading to permanent changes in the activity of genes, for example, Behie and her coauthor point out.  . Behie said she and her colleague are continuing their work, because one of this study’s limitations is that not all of the girls had reached menarche. The next study will look at the same girls at ages 14 to 15.  . The additional data should allow the researchers to determine how much earlier the daughters of smokers are expected to reach menarche. It will also allow them to link up with existing studies of how much more likely a girl is to develop a reproductive cancer for every year earlier she reaches menarche.  . “Being able to potentially quantify the increased risk for the daughters of smokers would give more weight to the argument made here,” Behie said. .

Jonathan Stempel|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday approved settlements for 78 cleanup workers who claimed to have suffered respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses while working in buildings near the World Trade Center site after the Sept. 11, 2011 attacks. . The workers, whose settlement terms were not made public, are among roughly 1,000 to pursue damages claims in Manhattan federal court for having cleaned more than 100 privately-owned buildings in downtown Manhattan. . These 1,000 workers brought claims against approximately 345 building owners, managing agents, tenants, environmental consultants and contractors. . About one-third of the workers have settled, and another 400 to 500 could follow within a month, according to Paul Napoli, a lawyer for the 78 settling workers. . U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan, who oversees much of the Sept. 11 litigation, approved the latest settlements. . He said they compared “favorably,” both individually and as a whole, with a $716 million accord he approved in 2010, which covered more than 10,000 people who worked at the World Trade Center site and brought claims against the city and contractors. . In a phone interview, Napoli said the 78 workers claimed to have developed symptoms such as asthma, breathing difficulty, excessive coughing, dizziness and fatigue. . The 78 workers settled claims against 134 defendants. Twenty-six workers resolved all claims, and 52 resolved many claims. . “These settlements with these defendants have been hard fought, and it is finally bringing closure in one of the last vestiges of this litigation,” Napoli said. .

|CONAKRY (Reuters) - The number of suspected Ebola patients in Guinea has more than doubled from last month, the health ministry said on Thursday, highlighting a “fourth phase” of the epidemic after a dip in cases in early 2015. . The worst outbreak in history, which has killed more than 10,000 people in West Africa, appears to be on the wane, especially in Liberia where there are no current cases. . But there is still resistance to the anti-Ebola effort in Guinea, which is struggling to control the outbreak and has overtaken Sierra Leone as the main hub for transmission. . Dr Rafiou Diallo, a spokesman for Guinea’s health ministry, said there were 91 suspected and confirmed Ebola patients in treatment centers compared with just 39 in February.  . “There is without doubt a spike in the number of cases, especially in Forecariah and Coyah (western Guinea). The explanation is there is still resistance that has not been overcome,” he said. . The number of Ebola cases in Guinea peaked in late December when there were nearly double current number of patients at 171, according to the World Health Organisation. . The current Ebola outbreak was first confirmed in Guinea’s remote southeastern forest region last March. . From there, it spread across the country and into neighboring states. Liberia and Sierra Leone were worst hit but Mali and Senegal also recorded cases. . Guinea’s President Alpha Conde has set mid-April as the target for completely ending the epidemic. Officials in Guinea have previously said Ebola was under control, only to see the virus later spread further. . “Officials are calling this the fourth phase of the epidemic characterized by an increase in cases following the dip in January,” Dr. Jean-Pierre Lamarque, regional health adviser for the French foreign ministry, said by telephone from Guinea. . The first phase was characterized by scattered cases in early 2014, followed by a spike in transmission in the forest region last summer and finally an ebbing in cases in early 2015. . Unlike Liberia and Sierra Leone, the other two worst hit nations where U.S. and British military forces deployed to support the fight against Ebola, Guinea has not seen a large scale foreign military intervention. |Thu Mar 19 15:54:09 +0000 2015||Guinea says number of Ebola patients more than doubles since Feb |5.785852565606973e+17|http://reut.rs/1BC3S9u
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The tobacco industry makes $7,000 for each of the more than 6 million people who die each year from smoking-related illness, the health campaign group World Lung Foundation (WLF) said on Thursday. . Last year, more than 5.8 trillion cigarettes were smoked, similar to 2013, as rising tobacco use in China counters declines in other countries, according to a report on Thursday led by WLF. . In their global Tobacco Atlas, the WLF and the American Cancer Society said that in 2013, the last year for which detailed figures were available, tobacco industry profits were more than $44 billion. Meanwhile, 6.3 million people died from smoking-related illness, equivalent to a profit of $7,000 for each death caused by tobacco.  . The report said that, if current trends continue, a billion people will die from smoking and exposure to tobacco this century. . Besides causing lung cancer, which is often fatal, tobacco use is also a major risk factor for a range of other illnesses. It is the world’s leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure. . In China, the world’s most populous country, almost 2,250 cigarettes were smoked per person over age 15 last year, making it one of only around a dozen countries topping 2,000. . The average Chinese smoker consumes 50 percent more than in 1980, a symptom of a broader phenomenon, as tobacco use declines or is stable in many wealthy, developed nations but growing in poorer regions such as Africa and parts of Asia. . “The significant reductions in smoking rates in the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implement increasingly tight tobacco control laws have been offset by the growing consumption in a single nation: China,” the report said. . Many countries around the world have introduced some anti-tobacco laws, including curbing advertising and banning smoking in enclosed spaces such as bars, restaurants and offices.  . But the Tobacco Atlas found that only 10 percent of the world’s population are covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and only 16 percent by comprehensive smoke-free legislation. . Low- and middle-income countries now account for more than  80 percent of tobacco users and tobacco-related deaths.  . The Tobacco Atlas also found that smoking among women is also on the rise, driving up rates of female lung cancer. . In an indication of future trends, there are 24 countries where girls smoke more than boys, compared to just two countries where more women smoke than men, it said. . “Whether it’s the link between tobacco and increasing rates of lung cancer among women or the ever-increasing number of health conditions and deaths related to tobacco use, the health and economic case for reducing tobacco use has never been clearer,” said John Seffrin, chief executive of the ACS. |Thu Mar 19 15:06:56 +0000 2015||Industry makes $7,000 for each tobacco death: health campaigners |5.785733748106445e+17|http://reut.rs/1xj14Di
|PARIS (Reuters) - Vietnam reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu virus in a village in the northern province of Thanh Hoa, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Thursday. . Over 350 birds were found infected by the virus in a village in Tinh Gia district last week, the Vietnamese agriculture ministry said in a report posted on the OIE website. This lead to the culling of a total of 670 birds, it said. . The outbreak follows a series of cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus found in birds in the southern part of the country earlier this year. |Thu Mar 19 12:09:20 +0000 2015||Vietnam reports outbreak of H5N6 bird flu virus: OIE |5.785286801016873e+17|http://reut.rs/1xik2cY

|SYDNEY (Reuters) - The icebreaker ‘Aurora Australis’ was forced to return to Antarctica on Thursday, to evacuate a seriously ill Australian expedition member, just two days after leaving him on Davis Station to spend the winter in Antarctica. . The Australian icebreaker will take almost two days to cover the 400 nautical miles back to Davis Station, because of sea ice conditions. When it is close enough, a helicopter will ferry the ill man to the ship. . “The current weather forecast for the next 40 hours is poor, so the ship will attempt to get as close to the station as possible,” the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) said in a statement. . The AAD said the man was in a serious but stable condition, without giving details of his illness. He was part of a team preparing to spend the winter on the frozen continent. . Once he is aboard the ‘Aurora Australis’, the ship will take 12 to 14 days to cover the 4,800 nautical miles to the city of Hobart on Australia’s southern island state of Tasmania. . The Davis Station crew were not expecting to see another ship for about seven months, as thick ice and extreme weather conditions seal it off from the rest of the world from March, until around November. . Candidates face rigorous medical examinations before being accepted on an Australian Antarctic expedition.  |Thu Mar 19 06:49:26 +0000 2015||Australian ship makes emergency return to Antarctic station |5.784481758135624e+17|http://reut.rs/1xhiBf4
|(Reuters) - The last two members of a group of U.S. healthcare workers whose colleague is being treated for the Ebola virus returned on Wednesday from Sierra Leone to the United States, where they are being monitored for possible exposure to the deadly virus. . Their repatriation brought the total number of Americans brought back from the West African nation to 18 since last Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday night. . “They were part of the same group that have been coming back slowly, said CDC spokeswoman Jennifer McQuiston. . Neither of the two healthcare workers brought back Wednesday has tested positive for Ebola, but they are being monitored because they might have been exposed to a colleague who has contracted it. . The infected healthworker is being treated at a biocontainment unit run by the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, McQuiston said. The CDC has not yet said how the initial patient was exposed to the disease. . The others are being observed at several different locations in the United States, including Atlanta, Maryland and Nebraska. . Most of the healthworkers were employed by the aid group Partners in Health, though CDC has not divulged their names. . McQuiston did not say where the two who arrived on Wednesday entered the country, or where they were being sent for monitoring. |Thu Mar 19 04:39:06 +0000 2015||Two more U.S. healthcare workers repatriated for Ebola monitoring |5.784153746156052e+17|http://reut.rs/1BAip5y
Victoria Cavaliere|SEATTLE (Reuters) - Washington state lawmakers are considering imposing a steep tax and other restrictions on the sale of e-cigarettes, legislation the bill’s sponsor said on Wednesday would be the toughest in the nation. . The bill is the latest effort by lawmakers across the country to address concerns over the health impacts of e-cigarettes, also known as vapor cigarettes or vapes, which are not lit like regular cigarettes, but do generally release nicotine in a heated liquid. . “Many people, particularly teenagers, are being misled into believing these items are safe,” said state Representative Gerry Pollet, sponsor of the Washington bill. “You deserve to know what toxic and carcinogenic chemicals are in e-cigarettes,” the Democrat said. . The legislation is part of a nationwide push by health advocates to tighten controls and labeling on e-cigarettes and cut down on an increasing number of young people using the products, which are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. . At least 41 states have passed laws prohibiting sales of electronic cigarettes to minors, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . Other states and the federal government are considering bans on the sale of vape flavorings, like bubble gum and chocolate, that could be attractive to minors.  . California and Delaware are looking to add the items to its list of tobacco products, which would bar their use in public spaces. . The Washington proposal goes a step further by subjecting e-cigarettes to the same 95 percent sales tax in place for regular tobacco products. . Currently only North Carolina and Minnesota have laws taxing e-cigarette products, and in both states the rates are lower than taxes on tobacco items. . Ohio Governor John Kasich has proposed adding a $33.75 tax to 30-milliliter bottles of liquid nicotine, nearly tripling its price.  . The Washington bill would ban flavorings and Internet sales, and require ingredients to be listed on labels. . “It’s an all-in-one piece of legislation,” said Karmen Hanson, NCSL’s program manager. . The American Vaping Association said taxes like those proposed in Ohio and Washington would make it more difficult for traditional cigarette smokers to switch to e-cigarettes, which supporters say are a safer alternative. . “It’s irresponsible,” said association president Gregory Conley. “You’re literally doubling, tripling the price,” he said. . The bill is expected to come to a vote in Washington’s assembly in coming weeks. If it passes, it might face stiffer resistance in the Republican-led Senate. |Wed Mar 18 22:14:08 +0000 2015||Washington state mulls steep tax, other restrictions on e-cigarettes |5.783184960078889e+17|http://reut.rs/1xfLWX8
Jonathan Stempel|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leaders of a Bronx nonprofit that provides drug and alcohol treatment to tens of thousands of New Yorkers have been indicted over an alleged scheme to plunder the charity and defraud Medicaid of more than $27 million, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. . The indictment announced Wednesday expands Schneiderman’s criminal case announced last October against Narco Freedom Inc, its founder Alan Brand and his son Jason Brand. . It also adds new criminal charges against the nonprofit’s chief executive, Gerald Bethea, Controller Richard Gross, Alan Brand’s son Jonathan Brand and employee John Cornachio. . Schneiderman said Narco Freedom cheated Medicaid by submitting claims for excessive services, operating unregulated treatment programs and coercing patients who live in its Freedom Houses to remain in treatment. . The Brands and Cornachio have also been accused of misusing funds to support lavish spending habits, including vehicles such as a Tesla, a Porsche 911 Carrera, a Range Rover and a vintage Corvette. . “Criminal enterprises that use non-profits to steal millions in public funds poison New York’s charitable sector,” Schneiderman said in a statement. . The defendants face from one to 25 criminal counts each, including enterprise corruption, grand larceny and insurance fraud, Schneiderman said. Narco Freedom faces 18 counts. . Michael Bachner, a lawyer for Alan Brand, said his client “continues to vigorously deny any wrongdoing in connection with these charges, and will be vindicated after trial.” . Narco Freedom and a lawyer for the nonprofit did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Bethea could not immediately be identified. Lawyers for the remaining defendants were not immediately available for comment. . Founded in 1971, Narco Freedom provides substance abuse, medical, mental health and social services to more than 36,500 people, including patients and family members, according to its website. . Schneiderman said the charity receives nearly $40 million annually in Medicaid reimbursements. . In October, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan filed civil charges accusing Narco Freedom of cheating Medicaid through kickbacks.   |Wed Mar 18 21:58:25 +0000 2015||New York charges Narco Freedom executives in alleged Medicaid fraud scheme |5.783145390092247e+17|http://reut.rs/1BznOdd
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – - More than one and a half million Americans have a severe immune reaction to the gluten protein in breads and other foods, and they are most often of European descent, according to a new study.  . Blood testing in a large sample of people representing the whole U.S. population showed that one percent of non-Hispanic whites had celiac disease – making them about four times more likely than people of either Hispanic or African American descent to have the disorder.  . Another 1.5 million people without celiac disease nevertheless follow a gluten-free diet, the researchers found, including a larger proportion of blacks than in any other group. . Celiac disease has been thought to be more common in whites all along, but the study is the first to examine the prevalence of celiac disease and patterns of eating gluten-free diets by race, according to the authors. . “We were able to go back and study trends over time suggesting that celiac disease is increasing in frequency,” Dr. Joseph Murray, the study’s senior author, told Reuters Health. . “That’s something we’ve shown before but (were) never able to show it in more detail with regard to the timing - the change seems to have happened around 2000,” said Murray, a gastroenterologist with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. . Murray said another expected finding was that celiac disease is really much more common in Caucasians and probably very rare in other groups. . He noted the recent interest in the gluten free diet, and said a lot of people are embracing it, but not necessarily because they have celiac disease or even a medical problem with gluten. . “What was curious is the fact that it just seems to be a practice more common in African Americans, for example, who are extremely unlikely to have celiac disease, so it probably reflects a lifestyle choice as opposed to a medical reason,” Murray said. . For their study, published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, Murray and his colleagues used data from the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years from 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2004 and 2009 to 2012.  . More than 15,000 participants aged six years and older were blood-tested for evidence of celiac disease. The tests were positive in about one percent of the white participants, compared to 0.2 percent of blacks and 0.3 percent of Hispanics.  . Overall, 0.44 percent of study participants had confirmed celiac disease in the most recent testing period from 2009 to 2012. That’s more than double the rate seen in 1988 to 1994, when 0.17 percent of people tested positive for disorder, the study team points out. . Among people who were on gluten-free diets without a celiac diagnosis, about 0.7 percent of whites and 0.5 percent of Hispanics fell into this category compared to 1.2 percent of blacks. . Murray said it’s not clear why blacks are more likely to be on a gluten-free diet, but it’s certainly not explained by celiac disease, and more research is needed to understand this trend. . “In my clinical experience I see some people go on a gluten-free diet because they genuinely feel better when they’re gluten free. Sometimes it may be because they’re eating less, they’re eating healthier - more fresh real foods as opposed to fast food,” Murray said. . Some people go gluten-free because they think it might help them lose weight, he added, although he doesn’t know of any current data that actually supports that idea. . “But I certainly tell patients that if they go to the trouble of learning what gluten-free is and they embrace that whole lifestyle they’re probably likely to eat healthier anyway,” he said. . Dr. Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Mass General Hospital for Children in Boston, noted that the study was done at a time when there was not much awareness about gluten, so the diet was not that fashionable. . “So I think it’s an intriguing fact that there are African American people that choose to go gluten-free because the fact that they embrace the diet along with the fact that the diet is more expensive and nevertheless they do follow it, that it’s clearly not because of fashionable reasons, but because they feel that was the best way to control their symptoms,” he said. . “You can’t necessarily say that (gluten) sensitivity is more frequent among African-Americans because of this – that would be a stretch,” Fasano said. .

Sharon Begley|(Reuters) - The U.S. government is preparing to roll back a widely criticized approach to public health, in which the “lost pleasure” people might suffer if they quit smoking or chose to eat healthier foods was used to reduce the projected benefits of new regulations, government officials told Reuters. . Economists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration incorporated lost-pleasure calculations last year in analyzing proposed rules for e-cigarettes and the posting of calorie counts on restaurant menus. The agency said the analysis provided a more accurate picture of the estimated benefits of a regulation.  .     A broad array of public health advocates, lawmakers, and economists criticized the agency’s use of the analysis, saying it was applied incorrectly and sharply undercut the projected benefits of regulations meant to improve public health. Some feared it would weaken the government’s ability to defend such rules in court. .     Officials at the FDA and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have now intervened to curtail such analysis, according to officials involved.  . HHS Assistant Secretary Richard Frank, a healthcare economist on leave from Harvard Medical School, asked leading researchers to offer “ideas for new ways of analyzing lost consumer surplus in these cases,” according to a letter last month to members of Congress, which was reviewed by Reuters.  . “Lost consumer surplus” is the technical term used by economists for pleasure lost by someone who curtails an enjoyable behavior. . Next, Frank convened a working group that included HHS officials, Harvard economist David Cutler and other academics. They held a day-long meeting last summer with outside experts, and have conducted further discussions by phone and email. . The group is poised to issue a white paper in which it will conclude that the FDA’s lost-enjoyment calculations went too far, according to two people familiar with the report.  . FDA economists will not be barred from considering lost pleasure altogether, but will not be permitted to use the concept to slash the projected benefits of public health regulations, these people said. .      There were “legitimate criticisms” of the FDA’s lost-pleasure calculations, Frank said in an interview. . “We’re not saying that lost consumer surplus is in no way useful, but it’s a matter of degree and how you apply it,” he said. There were concerns “that too much weight was put on it,”  he added. For example, the approach reduced the projected benefits of tobacco and e-cigarette regulation by 70 percent. .     Frank said all relevant agencies, including the FDA, participated in discussions leading to the white paper and are expected to accept its conclusions. “Realistically, we don’t want to have spent a year working on something no one will listen to,” he said. He would not say precisely when the report will be released. . Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, urged HHS to “reject the ludicrous premise” of the original lost-pleasure analysis. Durbin warned that “the potential implications of applying (FDA’s) flawed methodology to a wide range of public health issues are disturbing, and threaten historic advancements in reining in childhood obesity and heart disease.”  .     The FDA aims to finalize by June the proposed tobacco products rule that included the controversial lost-pleasure analysis. The rule will give it authority to regulate all nicotine products, including e-cigarettes. It is not clear how the HHS group’s conclusions will affect the tobacco rule, and the FDA declined to address that. . But one source familiar with the process said that if FDA economists improperly incorporate lost enjoyment into future cost-benefit analyses, especially when regulating addictive and other habitually used products, their reports would likely not be approved by HHS, which has authority over the FDA. .     Lost consumer surplus is a well-established idea in economic theory. It reflects the fact that when people are deprived of something they enjoy, they experience a sense of loss, which can be assigned a dollar value. .     In the case of e-cigarettes and other non-traditional tobacco, the FDA asserted that if the regulations succeeded in reducing tobacco use, smokers would suffer lost enjoyment amounting to tens of billions of dollars, Reuters first reported.  . The agency’s economists, led by Clark Nardinelli, estimated that lost enjoyment would offset by 70 percent the societal benefits of reduced smoking brought about by government regulations, including lower rates of heart attacks and cancer. Nardinelli has not responded to requests for comment.  .     The FDA economists performed a similar analysis for calorie counts on fast-food menus and vending machines, Reuters found. They estimated that consumers would make healthier choices, reducing obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, amounting to benefits of $5.3 billion to $15.8 billion.    . But the lost enjoyment people would feel by not eating their favorite cupcakes or fried chicken would reduce that benefit by $2.2 billion to $5.27 billion.  .     By making the societal benefits of tobacco regulation and menu labeling appear much lower, the lost-enjoyment factor left industry an opening to argue in court that the rules would not bring net benefits, as required by law, critics said. Many outside economists argued that the analysis was incorrectly applied. .      Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan economist who participated in the HHS working group, said it was incorrect to apply lost consumer surplus to an addictive behavior such as smoking. The vast majority of smokers say they regret having started and wish they could quit, he noted, so they would experience more satisfaction, not less, if they did so. . “The traditional understanding of consumer surplus assumes a rational consumer, and that becomes strange for a behavior that you start in adolescence or that’s addictive,” said Harvard economist Joseph Newhouse, also a working-group participant. .     In the case of calorie counts, the lost-enjoyment analysis doesn’t account for the pleasure consumers may get from making healthier choices, such as enjoying a sense of virtue, or shedding enough pounds to wear a favorite pair of jeans again. . “That’s just not in the (FDA) analysis, and it should be,” said Warner.   .     Public health advocates praised HHS for taking a fresh look at the lost-enjoyment analysis and working to “get it right,” said Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.|Wed Mar 18 20:48:45 +0000 2015||"RT @ReutersUS: EXCLUSIVE: U.S. to roll back ""lost pleasure"" approach on health rules.  http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CAaF8y4WsAAKf_f.jpg"|5.78297007833555e+17|http://reut.rs/1xfwlqD
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – - Doctors may have biases for or against people of different races and social statuses, but those unconscious views don’t overtly affect the care they deliver to their patients, a new study finds. . When tested with sample scenarios, most doctors showed some unconscious racial or social bias, but those biases largely did not influence their decisions about what care they would give the fictitious patients. . The study’s lead author told Reuters Health by email that past research has suggested a connection between unconscious biases and how patients are treated, so the new results are not definitive. . “We need to do formal observational trials to see what’s happening in real life and also look at other provider associated mechanisms such as empathy and mindfulness,” said Dr. Adil Haider of the Center for Surgery and Public Health at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. . He and his colleagues write in JAMA Surgery that gaps do exist between races in healthcare. For example, black patients are more likely to die after a traumatic injury than white patients. . For the new study, the researchers had 215 doctors - all normally involved in trauma care at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore - take tests to measure their level of unconscious bias for or against people of different races and social and economic statuses. . Most participants had measurable amounts of unconscious bias. On average, they had a moderate amount of racial bias and a strong preference for higher social class. Scores did not differ among doctors of different races, ages, medical specialties or training. Women, however, generally had lower levels of race and class bias relative to men. . The participating doctors were then asked what their treatment decisions would be in scenarios about people of different races and social statuses seeking care for various health problems. . Of 27 possible medical decisions the participants could make about the scenarios, the researchers initially found three that may have been affected by unconscious bias. . For example, doctors were less likely to order an imaging test for patients with sore necks after a motor vehicle accident if the patient was low in socioeconomic status, compared to a higher-status patient in similar condition. . Those links disappeared, though, when the researchers accounted for other factors that could influence decisions like the doctor’s own age and sex. . The study authors caution that they don’t know if their results reflect what happens in real life. . A previous study led by Dr. Lisa Cooper of Johns Hopkins Medical School, one of the new study’s authors, linked unconscious biases among primary care doctors to their communications with patients. If true, poor communication may ultimately lead to worse care for patients, the researchers point out. . Haider said trauma and acute care tends to be formulaic, and that may limit the impact of bias on medical decisions. Those biases may play a larger role, he added, in situations that require understanding and partnership between doctors and patients, such as managing a chronic condition like diabetes. . In addition to observing real-life interactions, “we need to figure out how to better communicate with all patients, who now are more and more diverse,” Haider said. . “We need to develop skills so that we can provide the best possible care to all patients no matter what their (socioeconomic) status is or where they come from,” he said. .

|(Reuters) - Charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has accused U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O of restricting access to its breakthrough hepatitis C drug Sovaldi in developing countries as it tries to protect profit margin in wealthier nations. . MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said Gilead’s restrictions aimed to stop discounted supplies of Sovaldi being diverted to patients from rich countries, but that the effort had resulted in “multiple restrictions and demands” on people receiving treatment in poor countries. . It said Gilead was excluding people without national identity documents, a move that hurts migrants, refugees and marginalized patients. . “We’re seeing Gilead trying everything it can to squeeze every last drop of profit out of some middle-income and (high-income) countries, and millions of people with hepatitis C will have to pay the price,” said Rohit Malpani, Director of Policy and Analysis at MSF’s Access Campaign. . Gilead said in developing countries it operates a system of tiered pricing and voluntary generic licensing to help enable access to its hepatitis C medicines. . “As part of these efforts, the company works to ensure that the medicines reach their intended recipients with patient access our primary goal,” a Gilead spokesman said. . Sovaldi, which is far more effective and better-tolerated than older treatments, has come under fire for its $1,000-a-pill price tag in the United States. It racked up $10.3 billion in sales for Gilead in its first year on the market. . Gilead said it is in discussions with 11 generic drugmakers to identify strategies for supplying 91 developing nations. But activists have said such deals would not ensure access to several middle-income countries where health authorities will struggle to provide treatment to patients. . “We will continue to seek input on all areas of our access program as it evolves, and make any improvements as needed,” Gilead said. . In a statement on Wednesday ahead of a meeting between Gilead and the generics producers, MSF urged the companies to reject a program under which it says the U.S. drugmaker keeps people in developed and some middle-income countries, where Sovaldi’s cost is “exorbitant,” from accessing cheaper copies. . “MSF is greatly concerned that this program will establish an ugly precedent and will be introduced in all countries where the company and its generic licensees sell the drug,” the charity said. . About 150 million people in the world live with chronic hepatitis C, most of them in low- and middle-income countries. |Wed Mar 18 20:46:20 +0000 2015||Charity attacks Gilead over hepatitis C drug restrictions |5.782963991183974e+17|http://reut.rs/1xfw4UC
|(Reuters) - Twenty-seven people have tested positive for tuberculosis at a suburban Kansas City high school where a student was recently found to have an active case, Kansas state and county health officials said on Wednesday. . Health officials have tested more than 300 students and staff at Olathe Northwest High School after possible exposure to tuberculosis since the active case was reported two weeks ago, officials said. .  Lougene Marsh, the director of the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment, said the number of people with TB infection does not exceed expectations. . “Early identification and treatment of TB infection is the key to preventing progression to TB disease,” Marsh said in a statement. . Those who tested positive will receive chest X-rays and antibiotics paid for by the state and county to kill the bacteria and stop the disease from developing, officials said. They were notified starting on Monday. . People whose tests were negative for tuberculosis will be notified by letter, they said. They will be retested on May 5 because it can take up to eight weeks for the bacteria to show up in a test after exposure. . People with latent tuberculosis infection are not contagious, do not feel sick, and do not have symptoms, health officials said. Without treatment, 5 percent to 10 percent develop TB disease, which is infectious, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Symptoms of the disease include fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss. |Wed Mar 18 20:28:34 +0000 2015||Kansas high school finds 27 positive tuberculosis cases |5.782919276547973e+17|http://reut.rs/1xftu0N
Susan Cornwell|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi are pursuing a bipartisan deal to spare physicians from recurring Medicare pay cuts, but the two leaders face a familiar conundrum: how to pay for it. . Hundreds of thousands of doctors who participate in traditional Medicare face a 21 percent cut in their reimbursements on April 1. The cut is part of a 1990s cost-saving initiative for the government healthcare program, which today serves 54 million elderly and disabled people. . The initiative has posed a long-standing problem, known as “doc fix,” for Congress. Over 14 years, lawmakers have temporarily patched Medicare’s “Sustainable Growth Rate” (SGR) payment formula 17 times to prevent sharp doctor pay cuts.  . Boehner and Pelosi, along with several committee chairmen from both parties, are in talks to permanently replace the SGR, which linked doctors’ pay increases to economic growth, with a more stable pay formula. . “We are proceeding in a positive way. It is an engine that is going to leave the station,” Pelosi said on Wednesday at a press conference. . Boehner told fellow Republicans in a Tuesday caucus that the leaders sought “a bipartisan framework that solves this problem for good while putting in place several structural reforms that would strengthen the Medicare program for seniors and taxpayers,” according to one source in the room. . Boehner said he hoped to reach agreement by week’s end, the source said. . The plan under discussion would cost some $200 billion over a decade, lawmakers and aides say. . The doctors’ caucus in the House is “delighted” with the emerging plan, said Representative John Fleming, a conservative Republican. He said the old repayment formula’s uncertainty has “destroyed a number of practices.” . But lawmakers have only worked out how to pay for $70 billion of the plan’s 10-year cost, in part by means testing Medicare beneficiaries so people with higher incomes pay more. . Some fiscal conservatives in Boehner’s caucus are wary.    Republican Representative Raul Labrador said this week that it is “incongruous” for Republicans to be talking about balancing the budget in a decade, while the lasting “doc fix” being studied could add up to $130 billion to the federal deficit.  . But a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, argued in a blog this week that the proposed structural reforms to Medicare should more than pay for the fix over 20 years. |Wed Mar 18 20:03:24 +0000 2015||U.S. House leaders pursue lasting fix for doctors' Medicare pay |5.782855958076293e+17|http://reut.rs/1xfqbqm
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - People over age 65 who drink diet soda daily tend to expand their waistlines by much more than peers who prefer other beverages, possibly contributing to chronic illnesses that go along with excess belly fat, according to a new study. . Research in other age groups has directly associated drinking sodas that replace sugar with artificial sweeteners and increased risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome and preterm birth, said lead author Dr. Sharon P.G. Fowler of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. . The new study only observed people over time, and did not test whether drinking diet soda actually caused gains in abdominal fat, she cautioned. “We can’t prove causality but there is quite a consistency in observational studies,” Fowler told Reuters Health . For older people, who are already at increased risk for heart and metabolic diseases, increasing belly fat with age just adds to health risk, Fowler and her colleagues write.  . To see what role diet soda might play, the study team followed people over age 65 for an average of nine years. The study started with physical examinations and questions about daily soda intake among 749 people who were over age 65 when first examined between 1992 and 1996. By 2003-2004, 375 participants were still living and had returned for three more examinations. . People who reported not drinking diet soda gained an average of 0.8 inches in waist circumference over the nine-year period compared to 1.83 inches for occasional diet soda drinkers and more than three inches for people who drank diet soda every day, according to the results in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.  . The authors had taken other factors like physical activity, diabetes and smoking into account. . “It cannot be explained by the calories,” said Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the study. . People who drink diet soda may be more likely to overeat in other areas, he told Reuters Health. . “The main point is for those who drink a lot of soda, diet or not, there may be a relationship with obesity,” Lopez-Jimenez said. . “I think it probably is true that for some people, if they are not being really hardcore about losing weight and getting a healthier lifestyle, if they switch over to diet soda that allows them to have an extra slice of pizza or a candy bar,” which translates to actually consuming more calories than would have been in a can of regular soda, Fowler said. . But another possibility is that there is a real causal relationship at the molecular level, which she believes is the case. . Diet sodas are very acidic, more so even than acid rain, and the acidity or the artificial sweeteners may have a direct impact on things like gut microbes, which influence how we absorb nutrients, Fowler noted. . “Calorie free does not equal consequence free,” she said. . Although it’s still unclear if diet soda actually causes dangerous changes to health, Fowler hopes that frequent users will try to wean themselves onto other beverages, like fresh brewed coffee, tea or mineral water with natural juices added. . “It’s possible to find things without sweeteners or dose the sweetener themselves,” she said. . The study doesn’t justify a recommendation to avoid soda, but it does very clearly show that drinking diet soda does not lead to weight loss, Lopez-Jimenez said. . SOURCE: .

|(Reuters) - Federal drug enforcement officials on Wednesday issued a nationwide alert about the dangers of fentanyl, a powerful opioid often used to increase the potency of heroin and blamed for an “alarming” spike in deadly overdoses. . Fentanyl, a prescription drug used as an anesthetic and pain reliever for terminally ill patients, is being illegally produced in underground drug labs for street narcotics, said Barbara Carreno, spokeswoman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  . “It gives dealers a more potent product, since fentanyl is so strong,” Carreno said. “Just like any other business, they are competitive and they want people to want to buy and distribute their product. The flip side is that this more potent drug is killing people.”  . Even a tiny amount of fentanyl can be lethal, since it is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine and as much as 50 times more powerful than heroin, the DEA said.  . “Drug incidents and overdoses related to fentanyl are occurring at an alarming rate throughout the United States and represent a significant threat to public health and safety,” DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement.  . Because fentanyl is easily absorbed through the skin and can be accidentally inhaled as an airborne powder, it is particularly dangerous to law enforcement officers involved in buy and bust operations, the DEA said. . “It takes very little for someone to overdose on it, to cause the level of respiratory depression that would cause you to die,” Carreno said. . In the last two years, there have been an increasing number of drug busts for fentanyl, with 3,344 instances reported in 2014, compared to 942 instances in 2013. . Fentanyl from Mexican drug trafficking organizations was seized in busts took place in the U.S. Northeast and in California, the DEA said. . Recently, fentanyl overdoses have accounted for four deaths in New Hampshire over two months, 80 deaths in six months in New Jersey, and 200 deaths in 15 months in Pennsylvania. . It’s a scourge last seen in the United States between 2005 and 2007, when more than 1,000 deaths in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and other cities were attributed to fentanyl. . “The source of that fentanyl was traced to a single lab in Mexico. When that lab was identified and dismantled, the surge ended,” the DEA said.  . It said the current outbreak affects a wider geographic area and an array of new and experienced drug abusers. |Wed Mar 18 18:40:13 +0000 2015||Powerful opioid fentanyl blamed for spike in U.S. drug overdoses |5.782646623215329e+17|http://reut.rs/1ByPij2
Megan Rowling|SENDAI, Japan (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Governments set targets to substantially reduce deaths and economic losses from disasters at a U.N. conference in Japan on Wednesday, but critics were disappointed by the lack of a firm goal to ramp up financial support for poor countries. . The non-binding agreement adopted after a marathon negotiating session, includes seven targets to measure progress on protecting people and assets that experts described as a leap forward. . The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, a 15-year plan, replaces the current 10-year blueprint. . In the decade covered by the expiring Hyogo Framework for Action, more than 700,000 people lost their lives, and over 1.5 billion people were affected by disasters. Total economic losses topped $1.3 trillion. . “This new framework... opens a major new chapter in sustainable development as it outlines clear targets and priorities for action which will lead to a substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health,” said Margareta Wahlström, head of the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). . Implementing the plan “will be vital to the achievement of future agreements on sustainable development goals and climate later this year”, she added. . Some were disappointed that earlier proposals for percentage goals were rejected. . Instead the draft text includes aims to lower the global mortality rate from disasters between 2020 and 2030, compared to 2005 to 2015, and reduce the proportion of people affected. . Another target is to reduce economic losses in relation to global GDP by 2030. . The new agreement also includes targets to reduce damage to infrastructure and disruption to basic services, including health and education facilities, and to widen access to early warning systems and disaster risk information for the public. . But some disaster experts said a lack of a clear goal in the agreement to increase international aid for risk reduction would undermine developing countries’ efforts to make progress on the goals. . Only Japan put money on the table in Sendai, promising to provide $4 billion in support over the next four years. . “Rich nations have pushed making financial commitments to reduce disaster risk to a separate round of financing negotiations later in the year,” said Farah Kabir, country director of ActionAid Bangladesh, referring to a conference in Ethiopia in July. . Without larger pledges, “the results for vulnerable communities in poor countries will be catastrophic,” he added. . Wahlström told reporters disaster risk reduction had received very little international funding so far, but she was convinced donors would make it a policy priority in coming decades for their development assistance. . Japan’s Minister of State for Disaster Management Eriko Yamatani said that for her government, it was “not really a cost but an investment for the future”. . The devastation caused by Cyclone Pam in the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu at the start of the conference last week highlighted the need for greater efforts to protect those most at risk from extreme weather and other hazards. . “Disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change and (are) increasing in frequency and intensity, significantly impede progress toward sustainable development,” the Sendai framework said. . “It is urgent and critical to anticipate, plan for and reduce disaster risk in order to more effectively protect persons, communities and countries... and thus strengthen their resilience,” it added. . Maggie Ibrahim of World Vision UK said the Sendai conference had put issues affecting the disabled, women and children in disasters under the spotlight. . But the agreement would not equip them and other vulnerable people with the resources and tools to build skills so they can better prepare for disasters and avert crises, she said. |Wed Mar 18 17:57:20 +0000 2015||New global disaster plan sets targets to curb risk, losses |5.782538690100388e+17|http://reut.rs/1xf9Kui
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - The gap between regulatory decisions on new medicines made in different parts of the world is increasing, imposing a high cost on industry and deterring investment, the head of research at France’s Sanofi said on Wednesday. . Elias Zerhouni, speaking at a conference in London to mark the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said there was an “urgent” need to harmonize regulations, potentially through discussions at the G8 or G20 groups of nations. . Previously an academic researcher and director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health before moving across to industry, Zerhouni said the divergent regulatory systems were at odds with the global nature of research and the drug supply chain. . “In my short experience of five years, I have not seen a single regulatory decision that was fully consistent across regulatory agencies,” he said. . While the EMA has harmonized the approval of new drugs in Europe since its formation in 1995, there is very often a gulf in opinions about the risks and benefits of a particular medicine between regulators in Europe, North America and Asia. . “There are increasing regulatory differences across the regions,” Zerhouni said. “It imposes an enormous cost on the innovator. I spend 20 percent of our R&D budget trying to mix and match in order to do the convergence between different systems.” . An analysis of drug approvals in recent years showed views diverged between the EMA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on whether to allow or deny approval of new drugs in 22 percent of cases, he said. . There were also significant differences on drug labels — the official descriptions accompanying a drug that spell out the claims that can be made about it — in 50 percent of cases. . Zerhouni cited as an example the EMA allowing Sanofi to make more claims about the benefits of its new insulin drug Toujeo than the FDA. . He said there are also big variations in the timing of decisions about the steps along the way in assessing new drugs, leading to frequent delays in conducting clinical trials.   |Wed Mar 18 17:14:40 +0000 2015||Sanofi R&amp;D head bemoans divergence in global drug regulation |5.782431324893471e+17|http://reut.rs/1xf1WbZ
Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) - A significant proportion of women aged 60 to 65 were still having menopausal hot flashes and night sweats in a new Australian study, suggesting that bothersome symptoms last longer than is usually assumed and are mostly going untreated .   . The use of hormone replacement therapy to relieve menopause symptoms has dropped dramatically in all age groups, the study authors note, but current guidelines advise against it for any women over 60, leaving this group with few options. . “Most of the recommendations regarding management of postmenopausal women apply to women less than 60 years old,” said Susan Davis, the study’s senior author. “So we specifically wanted to determine the prevalence of symptoms in women aged 60 to 65 years.” . Davis is a professor of women’s health and director of the Women’s Health Research Program at Monash University in Melbourne. . Hot flashes and night sweats, also known as vasomotor symptoms, occur when the ovaries reduce their production of estrogen at menopause. While not all women experience these symptoms, for those who do, it can significantly affect quality of life.  . “Some women simply cannot complete a day’s activities without considerable stress,” said Wulf Utian, an emeritus professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, who was not involved in the study. . Although women typically go through menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, and vasomotor symptoms can start at any point during that transition, conventional wisdom holds that they only last a few years.  . But one recent study found that for half of all women with bothersome hot flashes or night sweats, these symptoms typically last seven full years.  . Davis and her colleagues analyzed data from a questionnaire-based study of women across Australia and focused on 2,020 participants between the ages of 40 and 65.  . The researchers found that 42 percent of women 60 to 65 years old reported having hot flashes and night sweats, while 74 percent of women under 55 reported experiencing these symptoms. . For 6.5 percent of women between 60 and 65, the vasomotor symptoms were moderate to severe. The same was true for 28.5 percent of postmenopausal women under 55 and 15 percent of all women 55 to 60 years old. . Smoking and being overweight increased the likelihood of symptoms, while having an education beyond high school was linked to a lowered risk, Davis and her colleagues report in the journal Menopause. . Less than 12 percent of the postmenopausal women in any age group used hormonal therapy of any kind. Women aged 60 to 65 years were the greatest users of vaginal estrogen, a topical version of the treatment, with nearly 8 percent using this therapy. . Davis said in an email that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. She added that low dose antidepressant therapy can also give some relief. . Symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may also be caused by other conditions, Utian noted. “Especially in older women other causes include hypertension (most frequent), diabetes, anxiety,” he told Reuters Health in an email. . The researchers write that current clinical guidelines recommend that hormone therapy should be limited to three to five years of use and should not be used by women over 60. They note that their results show there is some discrepancy between the recommendations and what doctors are prescribing. But they point out that overall hormone use was “strikingly low.” . Such low rates of medication may show that postmenopausal symptoms are not receiving sufficient attention, the study team writes. Utian agreed that the symptoms of this age group are undertreated. . Davis recommended that anyone who experiences severe symptoms “should seek out treatment from a reliable source.” . “This is a real symptom, not to be ignored, for which numerous options are available that will provide significant relief,” Utian said. “Don’t try and just live with it, see your health provider.” .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Developing countries facing potentially pricey legal challenges from big tobacco firms are to get help from a new $4 million fund created by the philanthropists Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg. . Announcing the creation of the anti-tobacco trade litigation fund on Wednesday, Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said countries with limited resources should not be bullied into making bad health policy choices. . “This new fund is going to help countries who are sued by the tobacco industry fight back in court and win,” Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and one of the world’s richest people, told reporters in a telebriefing.  . Bloomberg and Gates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, cited examples such as Uruguay, which since 2010 has been fighting a legal challenge by the cigarette maker Philip Morris International against the use of graphic health warnings on tobacco products. . Australia has also been fending off a World Trade Organization challenge and a legal challenge by Philip Morris against its anti-tobacco laws.  . The tobacco industry’s use of international trade agreements to threaten and prevent countries from passing tobacco control laws was unacceptable, Bloomberg said. . “This is not about trade,” he said. “No one is a stronger supporter of capitalism and trade than I am. This is about sovereignty and whether a country has the right to set its own public health policies.” . Philip Morris International said in a statement that it respected “a government’s authority to regulate in the public interest” and believes “sound tobacco control policy and compliance with international law can easily coexist”. . “Governments can and should honor their international obligations when enacting tobacco control measures, and this fund can provide them with resources to do so,” it said. . According to the American Cancer Society and the World Lung Foundation’s 2012 Tobacco Atlas, the combined profit of the world’s six leading tobacco companies was $35.1 billion in 2010. . Britain voted last week to introduce a ban on branding on cigarette packs, following Australia in introducing so-called “plain packaging” to try to protect public health . British American Tobacco, the world’s second-largest cigarette maker, has said it will take action against Britain, which has a $29 billion tobacco industry, but the Department of Health said it would “defend this policy robustly against any legal challenge”. . Gates noted in a statement that smaller countries did not have the same resources as Australia and Britain. . “Country leaders who are trying to protect their citizens from the harms of tobacco should not be deterred by threats of costly legal challenges from huge tobacco companies,” he said. . The U.S.-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids will administer the fund, starting with $4 million. The initial investment is expected to grow as more donors come on board. |Wed Mar 18 16:40:43 +0000 2015||Gates and Bloomberg create fourth quarter million fund to fight Big Tobacco |5.78234587840684e+17|http://reut.rs/1ByrM5A
|PARIS (Reuters) - India reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus in a village in the northern province of Uttar Pradesh, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday. . Nearly 190 birds died of the virus in a village in Amethi district, the Indian agriculture ministry said in a report posted on the OIE website.  . An epidemiological investigation was ongoing and an intensive surveillance campaign has been launched in a 10 km radius zone, it said. . Highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths. |Wed Mar 18 16:02:34 +0000 2015||India reports outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Uttar Pradesh: OIE |5.782249852501279e+17|http://reut.rs/1xeOuVo
|PARIS (Reuters) - The United States has reported a mild form of bird flu on a turkey farm in California, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday, the latest in a series of outbreaks to hit the U.S. poultry industry in recent months. . The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report posted on the OIE website that a commercial turkey flock in Merced County, near San Francisco, had been coughing with a slight increase in mortality last week. . Samples were submitted for laboratory testing and were confirmed positive for low pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza, it said. . The infected premises was placed under quarantine following preliminary findings and an epidemiological investigation was initiated, it said. Follow-up surveillance and testing on 10 associated farms showed negative results for bird flu. . The strain discovered differed from the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu which has been found recently in other states, notably Arkansas, the heart of America’s poultry producing region.  . It was also different from the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu found on a Californian turkey farm in January which prompted five export markets to bar imports of poultry from the state. . Bird flu viruses are divided into two groups based on their ability to cause disease, or pathogenicity. Highly pathogenic bird flu spreads rapidly, may cause serious disease and has high death rates in birds. The H5N1 and H7N9 types have also been found in humans, causing several hundred deaths. . Low pathogenic bird flu causes milder disease that may be undetected.  . However, the H7 variant can mutate into a highly pathogenic type, prompting extreme precaution even in cases of low pathogenic outbreaks.  |Wed Mar 18 14:57:20 +0000 2015||U.S. reports outbreak of low-pathogenic bird flu in California: OIE |5.782085697047142e+17|http://reut.rs/1xeAA5G

Sharon Begley|(Reuters) - The U.S. government is preparing to roll back a widely criticized approach to public health, in which the “lost pleasure” people might suffer if they quit smoking or chose to eat healthier foods was used to reduce the projected benefits of new regulations, government officials told Reuters. . Economists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration incorporated lost-pleasure calculations last year in analyzing proposed rules for e-cigarettes and the posting of calorie counts on restaurant menus. The agency said the analysis provided a more accurate picture of the estimated benefits of a regulation.  .     A broad array of public health advocates, lawmakers, and economists criticized the agency’s use of the analysis, saying it was applied incorrectly and sharply undercut the projected benefits of regulations meant to improve public health. Some feared it would weaken the government’s ability to defend such rules in court. .     Officials at the FDA and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have now intervened to curtail such analysis, according to officials involved.  . HHS Assistant Secretary Richard Frank, a healthcare economist on leave from Harvard Medical School, asked leading researchers to offer “ideas for new ways of analyzing lost consumer surplus in these cases,” according to a letter last month to members of Congress, which was reviewed by Reuters.  . “Lost consumer surplus” is the technical term used by economists for pleasure lost by someone who curtails an enjoyable behavior. . Next, Frank convened a working group that included HHS officials, Harvard economist David Cutler and other academics. They held a day-long meeting last summer with outside experts, and have conducted further discussions by phone and email. . The group is poised to issue a white paper in which it will conclude that the FDA’s lost-enjoyment calculations went too far, according to two people familiar with the report.  . FDA economists will not be barred from considering lost pleasure altogether, but will not be permitted to use the concept to slash the projected benefits of public health regulations, these people said. .      There were “legitimate criticisms” of the FDA’s lost-pleasure calculations, Frank said in an interview. . “We’re not saying that lost consumer surplus is in no way useful, but it’s a matter of degree and how you apply it,” he said. There were concerns “that too much weight was put on it,”  he added. For example, the approach reduced the projected benefits of tobacco and e-cigarette regulation by 70 percent. .     Frank said all relevant agencies, including the FDA, participated in discussions leading to the white paper and are expected to accept its conclusions. “Realistically, we don’t want to have spent a year working on something no one will listen to,” he said. He would not say precisely when the report will be released. . Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, urged HHS to “reject the ludicrous premise” of the original lost-pleasure analysis. Durbin warned that “the potential implications of applying (FDA’s) flawed methodology to a wide range of public health issues are disturbing, and threaten historic advancements in reining in childhood obesity and heart disease.”  .     The FDA aims to finalize by June the proposed tobacco products rule that included the controversial lost-pleasure analysis. The rule will give it authority to regulate all nicotine products, including e-cigarettes. It is not clear how the HHS group’s conclusions will affect the tobacco rule, and the FDA declined to address that. . But one source familiar with the process said that if FDA economists improperly incorporate lost enjoyment into future cost-benefit analyses, especially when regulating addictive and other habitually used products, their reports would likely not be approved by HHS, which has authority over the FDA. .     Lost consumer surplus is a well-established idea in economic theory. It reflects the fact that when people are deprived of something they enjoy, they experience a sense of loss, which can be assigned a dollar value. .     In the case of e-cigarettes and other non-traditional tobacco, the FDA asserted that if the regulations succeeded in reducing tobacco use, smokers would suffer lost enjoyment amounting to tens of billions of dollars, Reuters first reported.  . The agency’s economists, led by Clark Nardinelli, estimated that lost enjoyment would offset by 70 percent the societal benefits of reduced smoking brought about by government regulations, including lower rates of heart attacks and cancer. Nardinelli has not responded to requests for comment.  .     The FDA economists performed a similar analysis for calorie counts on fast-food menus and vending machines, Reuters found. They estimated that consumers would make healthier choices, reducing obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, amounting to benefits of $5.3 billion to $15.8 billion.    . But the lost enjoyment people would feel by not eating their favorite cupcakes or fried chicken would reduce that benefit by $2.2 billion to $5.27 billion.  .     By making the societal benefits of tobacco regulation and menu labeling appear much lower, the lost-enjoyment factor left industry an opening to argue in court that the rules would not bring net benefits, as required by law, critics said.

|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said an advisory panel will discuss the development of Ebola vaccines, days after an American health worker was flown back after being tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone. . The federal health regulator would discuss the development of vaccines on May 12, it announced on its website on Wednesday.  . Ebola has so far claimed about 10,000 lives in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Only a handful of cases have been reported in the United States, Spain and Britain. . The resurgence of the virus last year prompted drugmakers from across the world to develop new treatments that are in different stages of studies. . Mapp Biopharmaceutical’s ZMapp and a compound from Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp have so far shown they could cure non-human primates given injections of Ebola virus. . Other companies that are testing potential treatments for the deadly infection are GlaxoSmithKline, Sarepta Pharmaceuticals Inc, Novavax Inc, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson. . The World Health Organization said it will decide on mass vaccination against the virus in August. |Wed Mar 18 12:33:29 +0000 2015||FDA panel to discuss Ebola vaccine development in May |5.781723690444022e+17|http://reut.rs/1BxyCsd
|(Reuters) - Palestinian students from the Polytechnic University in Hebron have created a vest that uses vibration and voice commands to allow the blind and seriously visually impaired to walk unaided. Their Smart Assist System for Blind People (SASB) is designed to be used in place of the traditional white cane used by the sightless. . Graduate student of engineering, Abdel Rahman al-Barmeel, who helped design SASB, said the system is simple and convenient to use. . “The project offered many solutions that differed to other previous projects, for example the idea of the ground sensor is very effective and new in this field. The system works on directing the people by voice commands and vibration commands,” said al-Barmeel. . The system also provides the user with a sound alert signaling its battery capacity, before switching immediately to energy saving mode before it runs out. . The project was developed under the supervision of the Dean of Engineering Department and Project Supervisor, Dr. Ramzi al-Qawasmi. . Al-Qawasmi expressed the importance of improving the lives of the visually impaired. . “The project constitutes of a vest worn by the visually impaired to help them to integrate into society and communicate with people through directing and coaching them through a path which is free of obstacles,” he said. . The vest wearer can also follow voice commands through headphones connected to the system. . “The students were able with their limited resources to design and execute this project. The project still needs more development with financial and moral support and needs to be embraced by institutions and potential youth sponsors,” Al Qawasmi added. . Blind volunteer Ayoub al-Sarsour, tested the vest on camera for Reuters, calling it “really great”. . Students worked with the Red Crescent Society to hire specialists to design the jacket. They are now seeking sponsors to help transform the vest into a marketable product. . It’s not the first such vest on the market. American device Eyeronman was released last year, a hands-free wearable device with sensors and emitters mounted directly onto a vest to detect obstacles. It contains LiDar laser, ultrasound, and infrared technology.|Wed Mar 18 10:54:01 +0000 2015||Palestinian students design vest to help the blind navigate |5.781473376771891e+17|http://reut.rs/1Bxg778
|LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Wednesday its experimental lung drug PT003 for chronic lung disease had proved successful in two final-stage Phase III trials, boosting hopes for the company’s respiratory pipeline. . The drug, which AstraZeneca acquired after buying Pearl Therapeutics two years ago, combines a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarine antagonist (LAMA). AstraZeneca plans to file PT003 for approval commencing in 2015. . Rival firms also have LAMA/LABA drugs that are more advanced than PT003, but AstraZeneca’s drug is administered with a pressurized meter-dose inhaler instead of a dry-powder inhaler, which may suit elderly patients in particular. |Wed Mar 18 07:44:52 +0000 2015||AstraZeneca two-in-one drug succeeds in lung disease test |5.78099737376641e+17|http://reut.rs/1BwKieB
Sharon Begley|(Reuters) - The U.S. government is preparing to roll back a widely criticized approach to public health, in which the “lost pleasure” people might suffer if they quit smoking or chose to eat healthier foods was used to reduce the projected benefits of new regulations, government officials told Reuters. . Economists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration incorporated lost-pleasure calculations last year in analyzing proposed rules for e-cigarettes and the posting of calorie counts on restaurant menus. The agency said the analysis provided a more accurate picture of the estimated benefits of a regulation.  .     A broad array of public health advocates, lawmakers, and economists criticized the agency’s use of the analysis, saying it was applied incorrectly and sharply undercut the projected benefits of regulations meant to improve public health. Some feared it would weaken the government’s ability to defend such rules in court. .     Officials at the FDA and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have now intervened to curtail such analysis, according to officials involved.  . HHS Assistant Secretary Richard Frank, a healthcare economist on leave from Harvard Medical School, asked leading researchers to offer “ideas for new ways of analyzing lost consumer surplus in these cases,” according to a letter last month to members of Congress, which was reviewed by Reuters.  . “Lost consumer surplus” is the technical term used by economists for pleasure lost by someone who curtails an enjoyable behavior. . Next, Frank convened a working group that included HHS officials, Harvard economist David Cutler and other academics. They held a day-long meeting last summer with outside experts, and have conducted further discussions by phone and email. . The group is poised to issue a white paper in which it will conclude that the FDA’s lost-enjoyment calculations went too far, according to two people familiar with the report.  . FDA economists will not be barred from considering lost pleasure altogether, but will not be permitted to use the concept to slash the projected benefits of public health regulations, these people said. .      There were “legitimate criticisms” of the FDA’s lost-pleasure calculations, Frank said in an interview. . “We’re not saying that lost consumer surplus is in no way useful, but it’s a matter of degree and how you apply it,” he said. There were concerns “that too much weight was put on it,”  he added. For example, the approach reduced the projected benefits of tobacco and e-cigarette regulation by 70 percent. .     Frank said all relevant agencies, including the FDA, participated in discussions leading to the white paper and are expected to accept its conclusions. “Realistically, we don’t want to have spent a year working on something no one will listen to,” he said. He would not say precisely when the report will be released. . Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, urged HHS to “reject the ludicrous premise” of the original lost-pleasure analysis. Durbin warned that “the potential implications of applying (FDA’s) flawed methodology to a wide range of public health issues are disturbing, and threaten historic advancements in reining in childhood obesity and heart disease.”  .     The FDA aims to finalize by June the proposed tobacco products rule that included the controversial lost-pleasure analysis. The rule will give it authority to regulate all nicotine products, including e-cigarettes. It is not clear how the HHS group’s conclusions will affect the tobacco rule, and the FDA declined to address that. . But one source familiar with the process said that if FDA economists improperly incorporate lost enjoyment into future cost-benefit analyses, especially when regulating addictive and other habitually used products, their reports would likely not be approved by HHS, which has authority over the FDA. .     Lost consumer surplus is a well-established idea in economic theory. It reflects the fact that when people are deprived of something they enjoy, they experience a sense of loss, which can be assigned a dollar value. .     In the case of e-cigarettes and other non-traditional tobacco, the FDA asserted that if the regulations succeeded in reducing tobacco use, smokers would suffer lost enjoyment amounting to tens of billions of dollars, Reuters first reported.  . The agency’s economists, led by Clark Nardinelli, estimated that lost enjoyment would offset by 70 percent the societal benefits of reduced smoking brought about by government regulations, including lower rates of heart attacks and cancer. Nardinelli has not responded to requests for comment.  .     The FDA economists performed a similar analysis for calorie counts on fast-food menus and vending machines, Reuters found. They estimated that consumers would make healthier choices, reducing obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, amounting to benefits of $5.3 billion to $15.8 billion.    . But the lost enjoyment people would feel by not eating their favorite cupcakes or fried chicken would reduce that benefit by $2.2 billion to $5.27 billion.  .     By making the societal benefits of tobacco regulation and menu labeling appear much lower, the lost-enjoyment factor left industry an opening to argue in court that the rules would not bring net benefits, as required by law, critics said. Many outside economists argued that the analysis was incorrectly applied. .      Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan economist who participated in the HHS working group, said it was incorrect to apply lost consumer surplus to an addictive behavior such as smoking.

|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A 76-year-old man infected with a drug-resistant “superbug” at a Los Angeles hospital has sued the manufacturer of a medical device that caused the illness in the fifth lawsuit related to the bacterial outbreak at the facility, his attorney said on Tuesday. . Plaintiff Domingo Gomez, who was infected by a contaminated device during an endoscopy at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, suffered significant harm from the infection, according to his lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. . Gomez’ attorney, Peter Kaufman, declined in a phone interview to release more information about the man’s condition or say why he initially went to the large teaching hospital. . UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center officials have acknowledged that seven people were infected with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria, or CRE, during endoscopies at the hospital between Oct. 3 and Jan. 28 and that two of them later died. . Kaufman said his firm has filed lawsuits against Olympus Medical Systems Corp, the manufacturer of the endoscope device, in five of those cases, including on behalf of Gomez. He said he was unaware of any other suits tied to the outbreak at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. . The complex design of the endoscopes, which are used to examine a patient’s digestive tract, linked to the California outbreak may hinder proper cleaning, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned.  . Hospital officials have said that, aside from the seven cases of confirmed infections, 172 former patients were informed they may have been exposed to the superbug and they were offered home test kits. . No new infections have been discovered among that group but four former patients were determined to be carriers of the disease, which does not put them at immediate risk, said Dale Tate, a spokeswoman for UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center.  . A spokesman for Olympus declined to comment on the lawsuit. |Wed Mar 18 00:01:12 +0000 2015||Device manufacturer sued again in 'superbug' outbreak at L.A. hospital |5.779830493187318e+17|http://reut.rs/1DzdkkN
Ben Gruber|Nashville, Tennessee - At 55-years-old, Terry Jo Bichell is a couple of months away from earning a PHD in neuroscience. She says it puts her one step closer to achieving a goal she set out for herself 16 years ago - to cure her son Louis from a debilitating genetic disorder. . A mother of five, Terry Jo had spent her life dedicated to helping woman and children, first as a documentary film maker in Africa and then as a nurse and midwife. . “When I had my fifth kid and he turned out to be diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome I stopped caring about other woman children and other woman’s problems and that is really true. . Terry Jo shifted her entire focus to Louis. . Angelman Syndrome, or AS, is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by intellectual and developmental disabilities. It occurs when the maternal gene, UBE3A, is either missing or damaged. That gene regulates the concentration of a protein important to development in the brain. . For more than a decade, Terry Jo sought out researchers and helped fund experiments and clinical trials in the hopes of finding treatments for AS. Over time, she came to the realization that in order to really make a difference in the world of doctors and scientists, she needed to become one herself. . During that time, research toward experimental treatments for AS progressed, revolving around ways to activate the paternal copy of UBE3A in the brain. The experiments proved promising in mouse models. The problem is that even if a drug is successful in activating the paternal gene, the researchers had no viable way to gauge if it is actually working as changes could take months or years to manifest. They needed a litmus test of sorts. . Terry Jo found one. . As part of her studies, she started working with Carl Johnson, a professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University. They discovered a link between AS and circadian rhythms with mice models showing that the disorder effects the biological clock. . “Our piece of the puzzle could be to use this biological clock phenomenon to see if the therapeutic treatment changes the biological clock which would suggest that, yes, that treatment is really working.” . Terry Jo feels her life has gone full circle, back to the days of helping others. . “So all of this has been a push to cure my kid and then in the end, I am going to cure other woman’s kids and you know what? And that is so great. I met this baby just a couple of months ago. I was looking at that baby and I was thinking, we are going to cure that baby, we are going to cure that baby.” . Terry Jo says she will not rest until that day comes.|Tue Mar 17 22:13:02 +0000 2015||A mother’s quest to cure her son |5.779558292629791e+17|http://reut.rs/1Bvm9Fw
Shereen Lehman|Reuters Health - Eating a lot of salty snacks is tied to higher blood pressure in Italian middle school students, according to a new study. . Eating lots of salt or sodium is a risk factor for high blood pressure, and the salt in the diets of children is increasing worldwide thanks to processed foods, researchers report. . “In our study, sodium intake from snacks represented almost half of the average daily consumption of sodium,” said senior author Simona Bo from the University of Torino in Italy. . The U.S. recommends children eat less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, but U.S. children ages six to 18 average about 3,300 mg per day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. African American children and those with some chronic conditions should limit sodium to 1,500 mg per day. . “Some of the major sources of sodium in worldwide children’s diets are pizza, chips, sandwiches and other salty foods that are often eaten as snacks between meals,” Bo told Reuters Health in an email. . “In our study, the sodium intake has been estimated to be about 3.1 grams per day, much higher than recommended,” she said. . As reported in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the researchers gave questionnaires to 1,200 kids aged 11 to 13 years in Torino middle schools, asking about their sodium and salty snack intake. . Salty snacks were defined as having more than 0.3 grams of sodium per portion and included items such as pizzas, crackers, potato chips, cheese and deli meats. . The average sodium intake from snacks for all kids was 1.4 grams per day. And the average blood pressure readings in the new study would be considered around the average range for 12-year-old children, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. . However, blood pressure increased as the intake of sodium from snacks increased, the researchers found.  . Eating two or more salty snacks per day was tied to an increased risk of having one of the highest blood pressure readings in the study, compared to eating no more than one salty snack per day. . The link remained after researchers accounted for the youths’ heights and weights. . “Snacking itself is not harmful,” she said. “If fruits and fresh vegetables are consumed as daily snacks, it would be easier to increase the daily fiber intake and decrease fat, sugar and sodium consumption, in order to reach the recommended nutritional goals.” . Meghan Garrity, a registered dietitian with Montefiore Medical Center in New York, cautioned that the new study’s design can’t prove salty snacks caused higher blood pressure readings. . Additionally, simply asking children what they eat is challenging because they may overestimate or underestimate the amounts, added Garrity, who was not involved with the new study. . “Nonetheless, this study very much demonstrates the role that unhealthy dietary habits are playing on the health and wellbeing of children on a global scale,” she told Reuters Health in an email. . Lauren Graf, also a registered dietitian at Montefiore, said it’s important to encourage kids to eat whole, real food such as vegetables, fruit, nuts, nut butters, dark chocolate, and avocado or salsa on whole grain crackers. . Graf said in an email to Reuters Health that too much emphasis on a single nutrient may encourage people to choose low sodium versions of processed food like chips that may have less salt but probably won’t do much to improve your health.  . Avoiding excess refined carbohydrates, such as sugary cereals, sweetened beverages and white bread should be encouraged, because “this can increase blood pressure irrespective of the sodium content,” she said. .

|(Reuters) - Nektar Therapeutics said its experimental drug failed to meet the main goal in previously treated patients with advanced breast cancer in a late-stage study.  . The drug, NKTR-102, provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over patients on chemotherapy in the trial, but the effect was not statistically significant, the company said. . The company’s stock fell about 16 percent in extended trade. . Patients in the study either received the drug or a single chemotherapy agent. It enrolled 852 women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who previously had been treated with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine and had progressed following treatment. . Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute. This year, an estimated 207,000 women will be diagnosed with the cancer and over 39,000 women will die from the disease in the United States. . Nektar is exploring potential paths forward for NKTR-102 in metastatic breast cancer with regulatory agencies, it said on Tuesday. . The drug is a long-acting topoisomerase I-inhibitor designed to concentrate in tumor tissue, provide sustained tumor suppression throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle, and to minimize toxicities.  . It is also being tested in several other cancers. .

|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Another four U.S. healthcare workers were flown back to the United States for monitoring for possible exposure to the Ebola virus, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday. . The return of the four U.S. healthcare workers brings to 16 the number of Americans who have returned to the United States from Sierra Leone since Friday, the CDC said. . That includes a healthcare worker in critical condition who is being treated for Ebola in a Maryland biocontainment unit run by the National Institutes of Health.  . Most of the healthcare workers are employed by the aid group Partners in Health. . Only one of the 16 has tested positive for Ebola. The rest are being flown to Atlanta and Maryland, which have special biocontainment units. They are all undergoing monitoring for Ebola in self-imposed isolation as they wait out the remainder of the 21-day Ebola incubation period.  .

Anastasia Moloney|BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Chile is considering a bill to ease a complete ban on abortion that would allow the potentially life-saving procedure under certain circumstances and has a high chance of being passed by lawmakers, a rights group said. . The draft law introduced to Congress on Tuesday would permit abortion when a mother’s life is at risk, when a fetus would not survive the pregnancy or in the case of rape. . The bill has been backed by President Michelle Bachelet, whose center-left coalition controls a majority in Congress. Bachelet, a trained pediatrician, had pledged to change the law ahead of her 2013 election as part of a series of reforms to shake up the socially conservative South American nation.  . “I’m positive the bill will get passed. It’s long overdue. Bachelet started the initiative so this has presidential backing and support from most of the political parties,” said Monica Arango, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Centre for Reproductive Rights. . “I would be surprised, though, if the bill gets through quickly. There’s still a way to go,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview in Bogota. . Arango said while many lawmakers are in favor of allowing women to terminate a pregnancy if her life is at risk, discussion is likely to center on the more contentious issue of allowing abortion in cases of rape. . The outright ban on terminations was put in place during the final days of Augusto Pinochet’s 1973-1990 dictatorship. A number of attempts since then to decriminalize abortion have been blocked by right-wing legislators. . Chile is one of six countries in Latin America, including El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua that have blanket bans on abortion.  . Estimates on the number of illegal abortions carried out in Chile range from 15,000 to 160,000 per year. . According to an opinion poll published in February, 71 percent of Chileans supported the proposed bill and 19 percent said they were in favor of allowing abortion ‘under any circumstances.’ . Bishops from the powerful Catholic Church and some conservative politicians have criticized the bill, saying that laws must protect the rights of an unborn child at all costs. . “Chile’s abortion ban goes back to the legacy of the country’s dictatorship, which overturned a law allowing abortion,” Arango said. . The U.S.-based Center for Reproductive Rights and other rights groups say total abortion bans are a leading cause of maternal mortality in all parts of the world because they force women to undergo dangerous back street abortions, which put their lives at risk.  . Restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number performed, according to a study by World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute for reproductive health. . The study found that the 2008 abortion rate in Latin America was 32 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, while in Western Europe, where abortion is generally permitted on broad grounds, the rate is 12 per 1,000. |Tue Mar 17 18:57:23 +0000 2015||Chile considers bill to ease abortion ban, likely to pass: rights group |5.7790659486174e+17|http://reut.rs/1BuBPJ7
|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Half a million babies die each year in their first month of life because of unhygienic conditions, development charity WaterAid said on Tuesday as it launched a child health campaign. . “The links between dirty hands, dirty water and infant mortality have been known about for over 150 years so this is not a situation waiting for an answer, but an injustice waiting for action,” said WaterAid Chief Executive Barbara Frost. . One in five newborns who die in the developing world could have been saved simply by being washed in clean water and cared for in a clean environment by people who had washed their hands, WaterAid said in a report. . The report coincides with new U.N. data showing 38 percent of health facilities in 54 developing countries do not have access to supplies of clean water.  . Nearly a fifth lack toilets and more than a third do not have anywhere for staff or patients to wash their hands with soap, according to the World Health Organization. . WaterAid said the figures were all the more shocking because the water supply for facilities defined as having access to water may be up to 500 meters away rather than piped in. . The two reports come as the United Nations decides on new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals which expire this year. . WaterAid called for a dedicated goal to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere by 2030. . It added that a baby in sub-Saharan Africa was 30 times more likely to die of an infection within the first month of life than a baby in the developed world. . “A labor ward without water is a danger to the life of newborn children,” Zambian midwife Mary Mwape said in the WaterAid report. . She said a newborn with a freshly cut umbilical cord which was washed using water from shallow wells risked contracting neonatal tetanus or sepsis. . “We know that we are supposed to wash our hands thoroughly before attending to another patient, but what do you do in a situation where there is no running water?” she added. . Globally one in 10 people do not have safe water and 39 percent lack proper sanitation. . WaterAid called on governments to ensure that water, sanitation and hygiene services are embedded in all plans for reducing newborn deaths. . All healthcare facilities should have clean running water, sinks with soap in all birthing rooms and patient toilets, it added. |Tue Mar 17 18:57:23 +0000 2015||One in five newborn deaths could be prevented with safe water: experts |5.779065930162463e+17|http://reut.rs/1DxPI03
|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Trader Joe’s on Tuesday announced a recall of its raw walnuts products, saying they have the potential to be contaminated with salmonella although the company said they have so far received no reports of illness connected to the nuts. . Trader Joe’s said the recall was instigated after testing by an outside company contracted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found the presence of salmonella in some packages of raw walnuts products. . Salmonella is a type of bacterium most often linked with food poisoning, and it can cause sometimes fatal infections in young children or frail or elderly people or those with weakened immune systems. . Healthy people infected with salmonella generally experience such symptoms such as nausea, fever and vomiting.  . Trader Joe’s urged customers who purchased any of the recalled products not to eat them.  . The privately held company said raw walnut products should be disposed of or returned to a store for a full refund. |Tue Mar 17 18:30:23 +0000 2015||Trader Joe's recalls raw walnuts products over salmonella risk |5.778997977949471e+17|http://reut.rs/1BurqwR
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Adolescent runners may be more likely to get premenstrual syndrome (PMS) than those who don’t exercise, particularly if they are older when they first get their periods, a small study suggests. . The findings contradict prevailing wisdom about PMS that recommends exercise to ease symptoms such as fatigue, muscle aches, bloating and mood swings. With just 125 participants, though, the study is too small to be the final word on PMS and athletes, write the researchers. . For example, there may be something about being a competitive athlete that allows young women to be more aware of changes in their body, “making the athletes more likely to notice PMS symptoms,” said Susan Girdler, a psychiatry professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She wasn’t involved in the study. . Periods, also known as menstruation, occur when the body sheds the lining of the uterus. The process causes women to bleed from the vagina. Usually, symptoms of PMS occur one to two weeks before menstruation, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. . The study compared symptoms of PMS, and a more severe form known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), in 75 middle- and long-distance runners and 50 healthy young women who didn’t exercise. Participants were between the ages of 16 and 22. . Most of the athletes had trained for at least two years and exercised for two hours a day, or around 12 hours a week. . There wasn’t a big difference between the runners and the non-exercisers in the age at which they started menstruating, but the runners had significantly heavier bleeding and longer intervals between periods than non-athletes. . Also, 49 percent of runners had PMS, compared with 32 percent of the non-athletes. For the athletes, being older, and having more years of training and a more intense workout routine increased the likelihood of PMS. . The runners also had more instances of PMDD, but that finding may be due to chance. . Members of the Polish research team, who published the study in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.  . It’s possible that the athletes might report more signs of PMS because many of the symptoms - such as muscle aches, headaches and fatigue - can also occur with intense exercise, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women’s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. . 	The findings contradict common perceptions of exercise’s effect on PMS, said Nonacs, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . 	She added that the focus on PMS in female athletes overlooks a much more serious medical issue, which is that often, female athletes don’t ovulate and the process of ovulation is linked to many PMS symptoms. . “From a medical perspective, it’s the lack of period that’s much more concerning because it puts them at risk for bone metabolic issues if it’s prolonged,” she said.  . Particularly with teen athletes, it’s important to watch for signs that they are training excessively, added Girdler, who also found lack of menstruation to be the larger health concern for young women than PMS. . “At this age you want to watch for skipped menstrual cycles, substantial weight loss, and any evidence that the workouts have become obsessive and go beyond just meeting the training goals of a particular team or exercise program,” Girdler said. “The level of exercise in this study doesn’t appear to be obsessive.” .

Daniel Wiessner|(Reuters) - A $110 million lawsuit filed on Tuesday claims a U.S. division at Swiss drugmaker Novartis has routinely denied female employees equal pay and promotion opportunities, five years after the pharmaceutical giant was hit with a nine-figure jury verdict over similar claims. . The proposed class action filed in U.S. federal court in Manhattan says Texas-based Alcon Laboratories Inc, which was acquired by Novartis in 2010, maintains a “boy’s club atmosphere” that is hostile to women and bars them from leadership positions. . Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power said Alcon disagreed with the allegations. . “The company is deeply committed to equal employment opportunity for all employees and to preventing discrimination,” Power said.  . A U.S. jury in 2010 ordered Novartis to pay more than $250 million in a separate class action that alleged widespread gender discrimination. At the time, it was the largest award in an employment discrimination case in U.S. history. . The company at the time said it would adopt reforms to prevent discrimination and retaliation against employees who complained. . The plaintiffs in Tuesday’s lawsuit, Elyse Dickerson and Susan Orr, say the company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits gender discrimination by employers, and the U.S. Equal Pay Act. . “For years, the company paid them less than similarly situated men, discriminated against them in assignments and other career-enhancing opportunities, and denied them promotions in favor of ... men,” the lawsuit says. . Dickerson said she was fired from her post as a global director for complaining about inequities at the company, and is seeking $10 million and her job back. . Orr, a research scientist, said the lack of promotions forced her to resign and is seeking at least $100 million on behalf of a proposed class of thousands of female Alcon employees. . In its most recent annual report released in January, Novartis said it has “continued to focus on the promotion of women.” Tuesday’s lawsuit, however, claims the company has no plan in place to address gender issues at Alcon. . Dickerson and Orr are represented by the national class action law firm Sanford Heisler Kimpel, which brought the earlier lawsuit against Novartis.  . The case is Dickerson v. Novartis Corp, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:15-cv-1980. |Tue Mar 17 16:26:20 +0000 2015||Novartis unit hit with $110 million gender discrimination suit |5.778685808274391e+17|http://reut.rs/1DxdhGa
|PARIS (Reuters) - France’s lower house of parliament passed a bill on Tuesday allowing patients near the end of their lives to stop medical treatment and request deep sedation until they die, a move that critics say is effectively a form of euthanasia. . The draft law, which polls show is backed by most French, passed in the lower house of parliament with 436 members voting in favor and 34 voting against. It is expected to get the final approval from the upper house in May or June. . It builds on Socialist President Francois Hollande’s legacy as a social reformer after he pushed through a controversial law legalizing gay marriage in 2012, and widened education on gender equality in primary schools. . The government is defying critics that range from religious leaders to medical professors and pro-life advocates who argue the new bill ushers in a form of euthanasia in disguise. . Allowing doctors to put patients within “hours or days” of their death under deep sedation until they die, as the law foresees, differs only from euthanasia in that precise time of death cannot be determined, they argue. . A Socialist senator warned the bill could alienate socially conservative voters, including Muslims, weeks ahead of local elections on March 22 and 29 in which the ruling party is seen losing ground to the far-right National Front. . “With this bill, the government is taking the risk of alienating yet more Muslims from the Socialist party,” said Bariza Khiari ahead of the vote.  . “There is a risk of massive abstention which could really hurt us in the next local election.” |Tue Mar 17 16:26:20 +0000 2015||French parliament passes 'deep sleep' bill for end of life |5.77868578638078e+17|http://reut.rs/1BtX7q7
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Other big drugmakers may be reshaping their businesses but Novo Nordisk’s focus on diabetes will get even bigger in the coming decade, according to the man most likely to be the Danish company’s next boss. . Kaare Schultz, who was made deputy chief executive in January 2014 and is the frontrunner to eventually succeed 60-year-old Lars Sorensen, said diabetes was likely to account for 80-90 percent of sales in 10 years, up from 79 percent now. . “This is the key focus for the company and we see strength in staying focused,” he said in an interview in London. . The world’s No. 1 insulin maker is not running out of ideas when it comes to fighting the global diabetes epidemic. . In addition to a new ultra-long-acting form of insulin, known as Tresiba, Novo also has two big bets in the market for so-called GLP-1 drugs, which stimulate the release of insulin when needed, with a potent once-weekly shot and the first ever GLP-1 pill. It is also experimenting with oral insulin. . Apart from diabetes, Novo also makes biotech drugs for hemophilia and some other rare conditions. But it decided in 2014 to ditch research into inflammatory disorders. . Last year, there were concerns it might be losing momentum in diabetes as rival products jockeyed for position and the company lost contracts to supply a major U.S. pharmacy group. . In fact, its modern insulins are still doing well, even as rival Sanofi hit a bump in the road, and daily GLP-1 Victoza is growing strongly in the United States, despite the arrival of weekly competitors from GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly. . Helped by a strong dollar, boosting Danish crown revenues from the United States where it generates nearly half its sales, Novo shares are trading around all-time highs.  . Novo’s next major move will be a push into obesity, which is closely related to diabetes, where it is preparing the U.S. launch of its keenly awaited medicine Saxenda, containing the same active ingredient as is found in Victoza. . “We will not launch this month but we will launch soon,” Schultz said. “It could be next month.” . Novo plans to use 500 of its 3,000-strong U.S. sales force to promote Saxenda and believes the new drug could eventually sell $1 billion a year, although the ramp-up will be slow. . “It’s going to be a challenge because of bad safety experiences with previous weight-loss medications and there is also a reimbursement issue around a new biological medicine that is injected and will be relatively expensive,” Schultz said. . Past problems with older weight-loss drugs have also led to slow take-up of a new wave of rival appetite-suppressing pills. . Saxenda itself carries a warning of a link to thyroid cancer in rodent studies but Novo is confident it can gradually carve out a niche market in treating seriously obese Americans whose doctors might otherwise refer them for gastric band surgery. . Schultz said cost would be more of a deterrent in Europe, where Saxenda is likely to be available initially only for privately funded patients.|Tue Mar 17 16:26:19 +0000 2015||Novo Nordisk CEO apparent sees even more focus on diabetes |5.778685766037914e+17|http://reut.rs/1DxdfOu
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Older people with a new episode of back pain shouldn’t be sent right away for x-rays or other imaging studies, new research suggests.  . They won’t be any better off, and they’ll end up with bigger bills, the researchers say.  . “We found that they didn’t have worse or better outcomes, and yet they were certainly getting more things done to them downstream,” said Dr. Jeffrey Jarvik, the study’s lead author from the University of Washington in Seattle. . Guidelines suggest that young people with new back pain should wait a while before getting X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), but the same guidelines make exceptions for older people since there could be more serious underlying conditions. . Based on the new results, however, people of every age should not routinely get early imaging studies, the researchers write in JAMA. . Jarvik told Reuters Health by phone that older people who get early imaging studies might receive treatments for abnormalities on the tests that ultimately have nothing to do with their back pain. . The researchers looked at data from 5,239 patients age 65 and older who visited their primary care doctor complaining of new back pain and returned for a follow-up visit a year later. . Within six weeks of the first visit, 1,523 patients had X-rays, MRIs or CT scans of their backs. . After one year, there was no difference in the disability related to back or leg pain between those who did or did not have early imaging studies, the researchers found. . Those who had the X-rays, MRIs or CT scans, however, ended up with medical bills averaging $1,300 higher than for those who didn’t have early imaging studies. Those costs include out-of-pocket payments. . Imaging accounts for most of the $35 billion spent on medical care for lower back pain each year in the U.S., said Manuela Ferreira, associate professor at The George Institute for Global Health and the Institute of Bone and Joint Research of Sydney Medical School at The University of Sydney in Australia. . “Adults with sudden back pain do not need to rush to get an X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), unless the clinician suspects the patient has a more serious condition, such as fracture or cancer,” Ferreira told Reuters Health by email. . “Less than 5 percent of patients with low back pain, however, will fall into this category,” she added. Most of the time, back pain develops from stress and strain on muscles or joints. . “Older adults don’t really need to be treated differently than younger adults,” Jarvik said. . Most of the time, the cause of back pain is probably never discovered, he said. . “That’s not necessarily a bad thing because most people get better,” he added. “It’s probably not necessary to try and discover exactly why somebody’s back starts hurting, the various investigations you can do often won’t reveal the cause.” . A thorough physical exam and medical history should help doctors distinguish between more benign forms of back strain or a more serious cause, Ferreira said. . In the meantime, people can take over-the-counter painkillers and may try physical therapy, which may help overcome a sudden episode of pain, Jarvik said. . SOURCE: .

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Although numerous studies have shown that regular use of aspirin or related drugs can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by about 30 percent, scientists have found an important exception: The medicines can actually increase the risk in people with certain genetic variants, new research shows. . The result, published on Tuesday, is yet another step on the road to “precision medicine,” which aims to match treatments to patients’ genetic make-up. If confirmed, it could alter recommendations for preventing colorectal cancer, which is projected to kill 49,700 people in the United States this year. . In an editorial accompanying a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Richard Wender of the American Cancer Society and Thomas Jefferson University called the discovery “scientifically noteworthy.” . “I anticipate the time when genome sequencing to determine a lifelong (colorectal-cancer) prevention and screening strategy is a reality, although it’s some time off,” he said in an interview. . Physicians sometimes prescribe aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with a history of colon polyps. For most people, however, that is not recommended, because routine use of NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. . The new research, funded largely by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, aggregated the results of 10 observational studies involving 17,187 people in the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany. Regular use of aspirin or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen was associated with about 17 fewer cases of colorectal cancer per 100,000 people. . But the consequences were very different for people with some DNA variants: 34.7 additional colorectal cancer cases per 100,000 people in those with variants of one gene, and 21.1 additional cases per 100,000 in people with variants of another. . The variants are found in 4 percent to 9 percent of people of European ancestry. . Since NSAIDs can have serious side effects - gastrointestinal bleeding can be fatal - “it’s a high priority to see if we can use genetic information to target preventive interventions for individual patients,” said Dr. Andrew Chan of Massachusetts General Hospital, senior researcher on the 53-author paper. . It is too soon to recommend genetic screening to guide decisions on NSAIDs for cancer prevention, at least until the results are confirmed, Chan said, “but this is a first step in that direction and toward precision medicine.” |Tue Mar 17 15:07:37 +0000 2015||Aspirin's colon-cancer benefits backfire for some DNA types: study |5.778487688271462e+17|http://reut.rs/1BtCevh
Megan Rowling|SENDAI, Japan (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A new global plan to reduce the risk of disasters, due to be adopted at a U.N. conference in Japan on Wednesday, will give more prominence to health issues as the world struggles to stamp out the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. . Measures should be taken to curb the impact of disasters on people’s health and to protect hospitals and other health infrastructure, the non-binding agreement, which will replace a current 10-year framework, is expected to say. . The agreement is likely to urge action to prevent biological hazards - which include viruses such as Ebola - turning into crises. . According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the new draft plan contains some 36 references to health, compared with just three in the current Hyogo Framework for Action, agreed in 2005. . “In the 10 years since Hyogo, governments have increasingly recognized that healthy people are resilient people, and that resilient people recover much more quickly from emergencies and disasters,” said Bruce Aylward, WHO’s assistant director general for emergencies. . The new framework is likely to include a target to substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure, particularly health and educational facilities. . According to WHO, in large-scale disasters, such as major earthquakes, some countries have lost half of their hospital capacity, making it harder for them to respond and provide key services such as treatment of injuries and immunization. . The cyclone that hit the South Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu over the weekend damaged the old part of the capital’s hospital - but a new extension withstood the category 5 storm, and patients were moved there, according to Rick Brennan, director of WHO’s emergency response department. . In the past 20 years, 79 countries have taken action to protect their hospitals from disasters, WHO said. When Mexico examined its hospitals, it found about 26 to be sub-standard. It demolished several, retrofitted others and built 176 safe hospitals, Brennan said.  . To help, WHO has developed a tool to help quickly assess the safety and preparedness measures hospitals take to stay operational in emergencies.   . The draft disaster risk agreement says more action should be taken to tackle pandemics and epidemics, like Ebola. . Brennan said mistakes had been made with the Ebola outbreak, particularly in terms of not identifying its emergence early enough. But “I am very confident we would do a better job next time,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  . As part of that, more efforts will have to be made to understand local communities and their customs in order to avoid the mistrust that has hampered the response this time around, he added. . The new global disaster risk reduction plan is due to be adopted by lunch time on Wednesday when the conference in the northeastern Japanese city of Sendai is scheduled to end.  . But on Tuesday night, negotiators continued to wrangle over the issue of international cooperation - the aid and technical support developed countries are expected to provide to poorer nations. Rich nations are reluctant to make hard-and-fast commitments to boost funding. . Grassroots disaster experts were critical of “limited political commitment” on finance, as well as the rejection of proposals for numerical targets to help measure global progress on disaster risk reduction. . “Over the past few days here in Sendai, we have watched the draft agreement grow weaker and weaker in ways so that it will not make a real impact on the lives of poor people,” said Harjeet Singh of ActionAid. . Plans to introduce targets to lower deaths from disasters, cut the number of people affected and curb economic losses, among other things, had been widely hailed as a leap forward. . But percentage goals have been jettisoned in the negotiations for language referring to “substantial” or “significant” changes, which critics said is barely more ambitious than the existing plan. . Margareta Wahlström, head of the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), said she had the impression people were “very happy” because the targets were “concrete” and could be used regionally and nationally, even without specific global numerical goals. . “It all adds up to a very strong sense that this is a step forward,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation earlier on Tuesday. . But Marcus Oxley from the Global Network of Civil Society Organisations for Disaster Reduction said the targets had been watered down in terms of how nations will be held accountable to deliver the intended outcomes. . “This reduced accountability will hinder the implementation of the agreement over the coming 15 years,” he said. “This will dramatically impact our ability to respond to and avert humanitarian disasters.” |Tue Mar 17 15:07:36 +0000 2015||Health a fresh priority in disaster plan, talks snagged on aid |5.778487665076511e+17|http://reut.rs/1DwPYfD
Saliou Samb|CONAKRY/DAKAR (Reuters) - Guinea has suffered a setback in its fight against Ebola with a rash of new cases, including three doctors infected by the virus, with officials blaming weak surveillance and a failure to follow safety procedures. . The outbreak, which began in eastern Guinea more than a year ago and has killed over 10,000 people in the three West African countries worst hit, had appeared to be on the wane, but Guinea has seen cases rise for three consecutive weeks, according to World Health Organization data. . A government health report from the weekend showed there were 21 new cases in a single day, a spike from the recent daily average of eight. . President Alpha Conde said on Tuesday that everything must be done to end the outbreak by mid-April, ahead of a meeting with donors scheduled around that date. . Ending Ebola could reboot Guinea’s mining-dependent economy that has been hammered by the outbreak which has scared investors, he said. . “With Ebola, it is easier to go from 100 cases to 10 cases than from 10 cases of to zero. To end it, we need ten times more effort than when the outbreak was at its height,” he said. . A big source of concern is a chain of new infections that can be linked back to a woman who died of Ebola and was not buried safely, according to Fatoumata Lejeune-Kaba, spokeswoman for the U.N.’s Ebola emergency response mission UNMEER. . “It’s a major setback .... It’s due to individual behaviors. That is having a devastating effect on the community. People are simply not practicing the safety rules that we have been talking about for a year,” she told Reuters. . Of the other two countries worst hit, Sierra Leone has also seen a spate of new cases while Liberia has no known cases at present and is waiting to be declared free of the disease. . The new cases in Guinea are in the capital and the southwestern town of Forecariah but if the situation is not brought under control they could spread across borders, said Lejeune-Kaba. . Guinea officials said the new cases came from high risk Ebola contacts who had left Forecariah and developed symptoms elsewhere, pointing to poor surveillance. . Sakoba Keïta, Guinea’s anti-Ebola task force coordinator, said on Tuesday that the government was putting in place new measures including strict rules regulating the movement of corpses and contact tracing. . “There are numerous gaps in the Ebola response in Guinea, notably in surveillance of contacts, and that explains the difficulty in making any lasting progress towards ending the epidemic,” said a spokesman for medical charity MSF. . The three doctors were infected at the Ignace Deen hospital in Conakry, which is not an Ebola center. More than 50 doctors in Guinea have caught the virus during the outbreak. |Tue Mar 17 14:51:55 +0000 2015||Guinea Ebola cases rise, three doctors infected |5.778448180696105e+17|http://reut.rs/1DwLllU
|(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s respiratory treatment for chronic breathing problems did not show any new safety problems while being tested to treat asthma, a preliminary review by U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff found. . The review comes two days ahead of a meeting of FDA advisers to discuss the combination treatment, Breo Ellipta, and recommend whether it should be approved to treat asthma. . The inhaled drug combination of a corticosteroid and vilanterol is already approved to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a breathing disability that gets worse with time and affects mostly smokers. . Corticosteroids smoothen the inner surface of breathing pathways. . Vilanterol belongs to a class of compounds called long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) that have historically been linked to asthma-related deaths. Glaxo licensed vilanterol from Theravance Inc in 2002. . Data showing Breo Ellipta’s LABA component delayed the worsening of asthma symptoms could sway the FDA panel in its favor, analysts from Robert W. Baird & Co said last week. . The FDA staff said on Tuesday there were no asthma-related deaths in Breo Ellipta studies it reviewed and that data on asthma-related hospitalizations were not observed uniformly in the 23 studies that Glaxo conducted.  . The data submitted by Glaxo showed that the safety profile of Breo Ellipta to treat asthma was similar to that of other combinations of steroids and LABA compounds, the FDA staff said. . They also said advisers would discuss the fact that the benefit of adding a LABA compound to a steroid was not demonstrated consistently in the trials. . Glaxo has three respiratory treatments on the market with a LABA compound and each of them carry a warning that the drug could increase the risk of asthma-related deaths. . This possible side-effect was verified in a study that tested another one of Glaxo’s LABA compounds, salmeterol, against a placebo. . Salmeterol, which is approved in the United States under the brand name Serevent Diskus to treat asthma but only in combination with an inhaled steroid, has been available on the market since 1994. |Tue Mar 17 14:04:39 +0000 2015||FDA staff finds no new safety problems with Glaxo's asthma drug |5.778329234596864e+17|http://reut.rs/1DwzoMY
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - As many as 1,000 people a day in Europe contract tuberculosis, and slow progress against the disease coupled with rising drug resistance mean the region is unlikely to defeat it until next century, health officials said on Tuesday.   . At current rates, the region has little chance of meeting a target to eliminate it by 2050, according to a joint report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). . “MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant TB) is still ravaging the European Region, making it the most affected area of the entire world,” Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO’s regional director, said as the report was published. . TB is a contagious bacterial lung disease that occurs mainly in areas of poverty and deprivation and spreads via the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It is hard to treat, requiring months of antibiotic treatment, and drug resistant strains are rapidly gaining a foothold.  . TB in all its forms killed around 1.5 million people worldwide in 2013 and the WHO warned last year that rates of MDR-TB were “crisis levels”. . The WHO’s European region covers 53 countries with a population of nearly 900 million, of which around 508 million live in the European Union and European Economic Area EU/EEA. . Tuesday’s WHO/ECDC report said the overall trend across the region showed TB rates falling in some high-priority countries, while the disease is fighting back in other low-incidence countries. . In the EU/EEA, some 65,000 TB cases were reported in 2013, it said, with 360,000 cases in the whole WHO European region. . “At the current pace of an annual 6 percent decline, the EU/EEA will only be free of tuberculosis in the next century,” said Marc Sprenger, director of the Stockholm-based ECDC which monitors disease in Europe. . He said that for Europe to reach elimination — defined as less than one case of TB per 1 million population per year — by 2050, it would have to cut down cases at least twice as fast. . “Our data show a Europe in need of tailored interventions which target each country’s settings,” Sprenger said. . In most countries were TB is relatively uncommon, rates are either stable or going down only very slowly, he said, and the majority of patients are of foreign origin. Countries with larger TB problems, however, also have higher rates of re-infection and report many more cases of multi-drug resistant TB. |Tue Mar 17 13:33:03 +0000 2015||Tuberculosis and superbug strains 'ravaging' Europe, WHO warns |5.778249714115707e+17|http://reut.rs/1DwsM1d
Amrutha Penumudi|(Reuters) - Esperion Therapeutics Inc said its experimental drug lowered LDL or “bad” cholesterol levels in patients who were already on statins, the current standard of care. . Esperion’s shares rose 19 percent to a record high of $91.50 on the Nasdaq. . The company has been developing ETC-1002 as an additional therapy to statins or as an option for patients who are intolerant to statins. . Statins have been the preferred first-line treatment for cholesterol for decades and many of them have gone generic. . Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer said he expects the drug to be adopted faster as an additional therapy to statins rather than replacing statins altogether. . There are about 35 million patients who take statins in the United States. Out of these, 30 percent still have cholesterol levels that are too high, Messer said. . “That is about 10 million patients, which is a huge market potential.” . Messer said he expects sales of about $1.22 billion from ETC-1002 as an additional therapy to statins by 2025. He expects sales of $1.65 billion from patients unable to tolerate statin drugs. . Esperion announced results from another mid-stage trial in October, where the same drug lowered LDL levels significantly than Merck & Co Inc’s Zetia. . Zetia’s 2014 sales worldwide were about $2.7 billion. . ETC-1002 is the first in a new class of drugs called ACL inhibitors that work by reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increasing occurrence of LDL receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood. . Patients taking doses of 120 mg and 180 mg of the drug showed 17 percent and 24 percent greater reduction in LDL cholesterol levels than a placebo. . The LDL-lowering power of the drug is about half that of the new injectable biotech cholesterol drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors. . Compared with PCSK9 drugs, ETC-1002 is not only cheaper but also more convenient for patients, Messer said. . “It is not a shot, so for your average patient ETC-1002 is an easy oral therapy,” he said. . “Only patients with severe cholesterol problems will take a shot and an expensive one at that.” . Shares of Esperion, which said it would want a partner to commercialize the drug outside the United States, were up 16.3 percent at $89.88. . About 2.9 million shares were traded by 12:15 p.m ET, more than five times the stock’s 10-day moving average. |Tue Mar 17 12:09:47 +0000 2015||Esperion cholesterol drug succeeds mid-stage study |5.778040158886584e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dwb1im
|LONDON (Reuters) - Over a third of hospitals and clinics in developing countries have nowhere for staff or patients to wash with soap, and almost 40 percent have no source of water, according to a WHO-backed international review published on Tuesday. . The report, by sanitation charity WaterAid and the World Health Organization (WHO) said that every year, half a million babies die before they reach a month old due to a lack of clean water and safe sanitation. . For one in five of those babies, just being washed in clean water and cared for in a clean and safe environment by people who had washed their hands with soap could have prevented their untimely deaths, the report found. . “The ability to keep a hospital or clinic clean is such a fundamental basic requirement of health care that you have to question whether a facility without clean running water or basic sanitation can adequately serve its patients,” said Barbara Frost, chief executive of WaterAid. . “Being born into unhygienic conditions condemns too many babies ... to a tragically early and avoidable death.” . Maria Neira, a WHO expert on public, social and environmental health, said the findings of the review — the first assessment of its kind covering 54 developing countries —  were all the more shocking as even where health clinics are defined as having access to water, the water supply may be up to half a kilometer away rather than piped onto the site. . “Pregnant mothers rely on a birthing environment that, at a minimum, does not place them or their baby at risk, saying nothing of the need for drinking-water or having to leave the facility to search for a toilet,” she said in a statement. . As well as killing young babies, the same unhygienic conditions also fuel major disease outbreaks such as cholera epidemics in Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Malawi, Tanzania and South Sudan, the report found. |Tue Mar 17 10:25:52 +0000 2015||Half a million babies die each year in unhygienic hospitals |5.777778676747756e+17|http://reut.rs/1BsMy6B
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first venture capital fund dedicated to finding new ways to prevent and treat dementia has raised more than $100 million with the backing of the British government and several of the world’s leading drugmakers. . The global Dementia Discovery Fund is unique in focusing on a single difficult to treat disorder and in bringing together industry and government. . Drug companies involved include GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Biogen Idec.  . The initiative, announced by Britain’s health minister Jeremy Hunt at a meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, follows a Group of Eight (G8) nations conference in London in December 2013 that set a goal of finding a cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia by 2025. . GSK’s head of research and development Patrick Vallance told Reuters the 2025 goal was “hugely ambitious” but that pooling resources through the new fund to back promising ideas from academic groups and small biotech firms would help to accelerate research. . “It’s tough to crack but the science is moving,” Vallance said. “People are now beginning to look at subsets of dementia and the genetics of neurodegeneration, so there are real opportunities.” . Venture capital funds are a common source of finance for high-risk, early-stage life science research, but the new fund is the first to focus solely on dementia. . The British government, which has worked with J.P. Morgan as financial adviser in setting up the fund, said that additional interested investors would have an opportunity to participate at a later stage. . As well as providing financial support, research projects that secure the fund’s backing will gain expert advice during the critical early stages of research, with charity Alzheimer’s Research UK also involved alongside industry. .

Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is betting on cheap mobile phones to cut some of the world’s highest rates of maternal and child deaths, as it rolls out a campaign of voice messages delivering health advice to pregnant women and mothers. . Amid a scarcity of doctors and public hospitals, India is relying on its mobile telephone network, the second largest in the world with 950 million connections, to reach places where health workers rarely go. . “It’s a huge priority for us,” health ministry official Manoj Jhalani told Reuters, adding that the service, advising on vaccinations and vitamin supplements, will launch in eight of the country’s Hindi-speaking states by Aug. 15.”These are the most cost-effective health interventions,” said Jhalani, the supervisor of the project, named ‘Kilkari,’ or “Baby’s Gurgle”, which will tailor its recorded messages to individual stages of pregnancy or the age of a newborn. . Poor sanitary conditions and stark poverty prevail in many villages in India, which recorded 50,000 maternal deaths in 2013, when 1.3 million children died before turning five. . Preventable hazards such as pneumonia, or poor nutrition, cause most deaths of mothers and babies. Many women give birth at home without access to clean water and toilets, while public medical clinics remain dilapidated and overcrowded. . Over the last 18 months, almost 100,000 rural families have signed up for the voice message project, first piloted by the government of the impoverished, but resource-rich, eastern state of Bihar.     . With India’s health services starved for funds, the mobile phone messages are a cheaper way to spread basic tips on health.   . Payment delays have led to months of disruption in the traditional system of home visits by health workers to encourage pregnant women to take medicine and follow safety measures. . The new project, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the charity arm of British broadcaster BBC, will make use of a national database to track pregnant women. . Another service, Mobile Academy, will also use recorded messages to help train India’s millions of health workers. . Health experts welcome the initiatives, but warn such mobile phone campaigns will not be enough to cut mortality rates unless India ramps up health services, particularly in rural areas. . “This (mobile services) will have a very marginal effect,” said Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in the western state of Gujarat, adding that the health system needed to be strengthened in remote areas. |Tue Mar 17 08:01:59 +0000 2015||India bets on mobiles in battle on maternal, child deaths |5.777416585922642e+17|http://reut.rs/1DvspUz
Laura Zuckerman|(Reuters) - Managers of Yellowstone National Park bison said Monday they are considering changes to policies that have seen thousands of purebred buffalo from the nation’s last wild herd bison killed since 2000 to stem transmission of a disease to cattle.  . Yellowstone bison have been at the center of a bitter debate over a management plan crafted 15 years ago that seeks to keep the population at 3,000 and permits killing of many buffalo that migrate from the park to bordering Montana for winter forage.  . Montana cattlemen fear wandering bison exposed to brucellosis, a disease first brought to the park by domestic livestock, will infect their cows, causing them to abort their young and endangering the state’s brucellosis-free status.  . But buffalo advocates and those who promote Montana tourism argue the park’s bison should be allowed to roam without being marked for death as the herd represents the nation’s rich wildlife heritage and is a top draw for the roughly 3 million annual visitors to Yellowstone.  . Government and tribal managers are considering six alternative management options submitted by agencies including the state of Montana and the National Park Service.  . The alternatives are open for public comment until June 15. The options range from one in which Yellowstone would be home to thousands more bison without severe culling to a plan that would likely see many more of the massive, hump-shouldered creatures targeted for death.  . Buffalo once thundered by the tens of millions west of the Mississippi, but extermination campaigns in the late 19th century pushed them to the edge of extinction.  . The population at the park last year was estimated at 4,900, 1,900 more than allowed under the management plan agreed upon by Native American tribes and government agencies – including the park and Montana Department of Livestock – that oversee the herd.  . The roughly 700 bison that have strayed into Montana this winter have been killed, mostly through transfer to tribes which have the animals slaughtered but also through hunting outside the boundaries of Yellowstone.  . The culling has triggered protests by wildlife advocates but has been endorsed by livestock organizations like the Montana Stockgrowers Association and by leaders of some American Indian tribes.  . The Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a conservation group, is arguing for expanded year-round habitat for bison outside the park where the animals would not be subjected to seasonal hazing or capture as has been practiced for more than a decade.  . The Montana Stockgrowers Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  |Tue Mar 17 03:47:20 +0000 2015||Yellowstone bison managers consider alternative management policies |5.776775720053432e+17|http://reut.rs/1DuN3nC
Laura Zuckerman|SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - Avian cholera is suspected in the deaths of at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in Idaho while migrating to nesting grounds on the northern coast of Alaska, wildlife managers said Monday. . Dozens of Idaho Department of Fish and Game workers and volunteers at the weekend retrieved and incinerated carcasses of snow geese found near bodies of water and a wildlife management area in the eastern part of the state, said agency spokesman Gregg Losinski. . Avian cholera is believed to be the culprit in the deaths mostly because of the way the birds died, he said. . “Basically, they just fell out of the sky,” said Losinski. . He said biologists were awaiting results from a state wildlife lab to confirm the birds died of the highly contagious disease, which is caused by bacteria that can survive in soil and water for up to four months. . Humans face a small risk of contracting the disease but the more immediate threat is to wildlife in the vicinity of contaminated carcasses, Losinski said. . About 20 bald eagles were seen near areas where snow geese carcasses littered the ground but a lengthy incubation period makes it unclear if the eagles were infected and would carry the ailment elsewhere, said Losinski. . It was not known where the snow geese – named for their white plumage and for breeding in the far northern corners of Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Siberia – contracted avian cholera during a migration that saw them wing north from wintering grounds in the American Southwest and Mexico, he said. . Outbreaks like the one found affecting the migrating snow geese in Idaho occur periodically in the United States and elsewhere, Losinski said. . Avian cholera is the most important infectious disease affecting wild waterfowl in North America, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. |Tue Mar 17 03:31:35 +0000 2015||Thousands of snow geese fall dead from sky in Idaho |5.776736098392883e+17|http://reut.rs/1BrNWXj
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American being treated for Ebola was in critical condition Monday, the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Maryland said. . The healthcare worker was evacuated from West Africa and arrived at the NIH clinical center on Friday. The clinician, who has not been identified, was working with Partners In Health at the medical aid group’s Sierra Leone Ebola center. . Partners in Health said in a statement that 10 of its clinicians in Sierra Leone came to the aid of their ailing colleague. They were all subsequently identified as contacts of the patient being treated at NIH. . The 10 individuals were flown to the United States via non-commercial aircraft to be monitored at designated Ebola treatment facilities to give them access to rapid testing and, if necessary, treatment. . Four are being monitored by doctors at Nebraska Medicine; one of them developed symptoms on Sunday evening and was moved into the Nebraska Medicine biocontainment facility, Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit, said in a statement. However, Smith said some of those symptoms have since resolved. . “At this point, this person has not tested positive for the Ebola virus,” Smith said. . The hospital said a fifth person from the original exposure group in Sierra Leone is being transferred to the Nebraska facility for monitoring later on Monday. . The healthcare workers will voluntarily isolate themselves during the remainder of the 21-day Ebola incubation period, Partners in Health said. . Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency is continuing to investigate the circumstances around the 10 exposures. |Tue Mar 17 03:15:44 +0000 2015||U.S. Ebola patient now in critical condition: NIH |5.776696174029169e+17|http://reut.rs/1DuI5Y4
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - When diabetic patients report problems with their insulin pumps, the pump manufacturers collect that information – but there’s no easy way for researchers to analyze the data independently, a new paper says. . In a joint statement, experts from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes say regulatory agencies should work together to create standards that apply to all pump manufacturers. . People who use these devices shouldn’t be alarmed, however. . “Overall they are really pretty safe as long as people follow the instruction and do what they’re supposed to,” said Dr. Anne Peters, director of the University of Southern California Clinical Diabetes Program and coauthor of the new statement.  . But anybody who wears a pump knows they do sometimes fail, she told Reuters Health by phone. . Five percent of the 29 million Americans with diabetes have type 1 diabetes and need to use either daily insulin injections or an insulin pump to survive, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Insulin pumps combine an external pump case, which can be attached to clothing, with a catheter placed under the skin.  They deliver the hormone continuously and can be programmed to deliver extra doses during meals or snacks.  . Up to one million people worldwide may use these pumps, although it is difficult to estimate since the number sold and currently operating is not reported by manufacturers, the authors write in the new statement, published in Diabetes Care. . As the devices become smaller and more sophisticated, updated versions have entered the market rapidly, they write. Analyzing patient reports of problems with the new devices could help assure quality and improve safety. . In the U.S., patients report problems to the manufacturers, who in turn report the data to the Food and Drug Administration. It’s publicly available, but each company uses its own review and categorization procedure and is responsible for determining whether a pattern of problems exists. The database is difficult to search and sort, Peters said. . “It’s really hard for a clinician like myself to access that data,” Peters said. “How often does a pump fail and need to be replaced? I don’t know.” . One review found that 1,594 insulin pump problems were reported to the FDA between 1996 and 2005, including 13 deaths. Serious and fatal pump reports increased by about 17 percent per year between 2001 and 2009, which may have been due to more widespread use, but without an easier way to study the data the true cause is uncertain, the authors write. . More than 29,000 people in 2013 called a manufacturer to say their pump broke, Peters said. . “People with diabetes should know that the professional societies in Europe and the U.S. are working together to lobby the industry and the regulators to set higher standards around the approval of pumps in the marketplace and transparency of data on adverse events,” said John Petrie of the University of Glasgow in the U.K., a coauthor of the statement. . Petrie said insulin pump users should tell manufacturers about any issues that might be attributable to their device. “This will help ensure that any problems, e.g. due to ongoing changes in design and specifications, are detected as early as possible,” Petrie told Reuters Health by email. . One in every four people using a pump for a year may experience pump failure, which is too high, he said. . It’s important that patients know how to handle a pump failure, Peters said. Patients should be taught how to troubleshoot when they receive the pump and then reminded periodically, she said, so they’ll know what to do if the device stops working. . When pumps break it can take a few days to get a replacement, she said. Anyone using a pump should maintain a current printout of pump settings and have some long-acting insulin on hand. . SOURCE: .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - New hepatitis C drugs that shorten treatment times are largely cost-effective despite their hefty U.S. price tags, according to two new analyses. . The widespread use of a combination of drugs that include Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, known generically as sofosbuvir, will nonetheless be a significant cost for the U.S. healthcare system, researchers wrote. . Sovaldi’s initial $84,000 price drew widespread criticism last year, and insurers have since pressed Gilead and rival AbbVie Inc to offer steep discounts on the treatments. . One analysis published on Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine found treatment involving Sovaldi cost-effective for people with the most common type of hepatitis C, known as genotype 1, compared with older treatments. . It was funded by CVS Health, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers, and was based on Gilead’s 2014 pricing, before it began to offer greater discounts. . The new drugs cost $12,825 for every healthy year of life patients gained over older treatments, the researchers said. That was below the usual cutoff of $50,000 per healthy year of life gained for cost-effectiveness. . Senior author Dr. Niteesh Choudhry cautioned that the analysis looks at benefits over the course of a person’s life, while the cost of treatment is paid upfront. . “We look over the long term and it takes a long time for these dollars to be incorporated,” said Choudhry, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. . A second analysis published in the same journal found that treating all eligible U.S. hepatitis C patients over the next five years, at 2014 prices, would cost an additional $65 billion more than older and less-effective treatments. . Based on reduced 2015 prices, the researchers said, the costs would total an additional $20 billion over the next five years. . Treating the patients with the new drugs would also prevent about $16 billion in healthcare spending in the future, the researchers said. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. . “These drugs are good value for the money,” said lead author Jagpreet Chhatwal, from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. . Gilead offers a combination drug known as Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi and the company’s ledipasvir. AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, which was approved in the United States in late 2014, was not evaluated in either of the analyses. .

|(Reuters) - An independent panel recommended unblinding a late-stage study testing Pharmacyclics Inc and Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica, after the treatment was successful against two similar forms of cancer in combination with other drugs. . Pharmacyclics, which recently agreed to be acquired by AbbVie Inc for about $21 billion, said Imbruvica showed a statistically significant improvement in survival without disease progression, the study’s main goal. . Pharmacyclics’ shares closed up about 0.7 percent on Monday, while AbbVie’s stock closed up about 2 percent. . Imbruvica, which is co-marketed by Pharmacyclics and J&J, is already approved for four cancer indications in the United States. . The study is testing Imbruvica in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR), against a placebo in combination with BR, in 578 previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. . Imbruvica is already approved for CLL patients who have had at least one prior therapy. . Detailed results of the study will be submitted to health authorities for future labeling considerations, Pharmacyclics said. . The company has forecast U.S. sales of Imbruvica to hit $1 billion this year. Worldwide sales are forecast to reach $5.8 billion by 2020, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. |Mon Mar 16 20:01:28 +0000 2015||FDA panel recommends unblinding study after Imbruvica shows clear benefit |5.775603305424036e+17|http://reut.rs/1DtnzXL
|LONDON (Reuters) - Plans to ban branding on cigarette packaging in England passed their final legislative hurdle on Monday after lawmakers in Britain’s upper house of parliament approved them, meaning firms will be forced to adopt plain, standardized packets. . The move, which had been expected after lawmakers in the lower chamber of parliament backed the measure last week, means the ban will now come into effect in May 2016. . Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative-led government is introducing the measures after years of political wrangling and private lobbying, arguing it will improve public health and cut the number of child smokers. . “This is a decisive moment in the long and patient struggle to reduce, and then end, the horrors that the tobacco industry has brought to our country and to the rest of the world,” said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH). . Cigarette manufacturers last week threatened to take legal action if the ban was approved, saying it infringed intellectual property rights and would increase counterfeiting and smuggling. . The new rules will initially take effect in England only, though the Welsh government has said it will follow suit and Northern Ireland and Scotland are considering a similar step. |Mon Mar 16 19:29:51 +0000 2015||UK cigarette packet branding ban passes final legislative hurdle |5.775523748411228e+17|http://reut.rs/1BqflZy

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Most healthcare providers aren’t trained to recognize victims of sex trafficking - and many don’t realize that’s a problem, according to a new study. . “The majority of medical providers will come across victims or patients who are at risk for victimization at some point,” said Angela Rabbitt of Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin’s Child Advocacy and Protection Services in Milwaukee. . OB/GYNs, emergency room personnel, doctors working with adolescents or with child abuse victims, and those working with urban and underserved populations are most likely to encounter victims of sex trafficking, Rabbitt said in an email to Reuters Health.  . That’s because reproductive healthcare problems like pregnancy, abortions, and infection, and also violence related injuries are more common in these individuals, she said. . Rabbitt and her coauthors reached out to physicians, nurses, physician assistants, social workers, and patient and family advocates at several hospitals and medical clinics in Wisconsin. Of about 500 providers contacted, only 168 – mostly women - filled out the online surveys. . More than 60 percent said they’d never been trained to recognize a victim of sex trafficking. Those who did receive training were more likely to say that trafficking is a major problem locally and had more confidence in their ability to identify victims. . Only 10 percent of providers with training said they had never encountered a trafficking victim, compared to 35 percent of those without training. . The surveys included various vignettes designed to test whether providers would recognize a victim of sex trafficking, such as an underage female who is forced to have sex by an adult, or who chose to have sex for money.  . In either case, a minor would meet the legal definition of sex trafficking victim, but only 48 percent of providers correctly identified this. . Lack of training and awareness are important barriers to identifying victims, the authors write in Pediatrics. . “It’s no surprise because where are people going to learn about this?” said Donna Sabella, director of the Office of Human Trafficking at Drexel University College of Nursing and Health Professions. “It’s typically not part of any medical school curriculum.” . Sabella said social work departments at some U.S. universities offer short courses to give health care providers an overview of what sex trafficking is and what its victims may look like - which is to say, Sabella said, that they could look like anyone. . Good data are lacking on how many people are victims of sex trafficking, but it’s well known that big sporting events like the Super Bowl draw traffickers in large numbers, Sabella told Reuters Health by phone. . “We can’t arrest people, we don’t interrogate people,” but there are helpful questions to ask, and clear steps to take when reporting a victim, she said. . Adult victims can decide for themselves if they want the crime reported, she said. But if a provider suspects a minor is a victim of trafficking, they’re mandated by law to report it.  . “We recommend reporting to both law enforcement and child protective services,” Rabbitt said. . Many victims are unwilling to disclose their victimization and many are simply not asked, she said.   . “It is clear that the number of victims is probably much higher than the current research would suggest and that the number increased significantly once we became aware of the problem and started screening patients,” she said. . It is especially important to look for signs of victimization among kids and young adults. . “I think often when the community, including the medical community, sees a victim of domestic sex trafficking their first thought is that he or she is a prostitute who chose that lifestyle,” Rabbitt said. “There is now a growing awareness that many “prostitutes” start out as children or as young adults who were coerced or forced into the sex trade and now due to fear, addiction, or many other reasons, find it very hard to get out of the life.”  . “When you see them as victims, it makes it more obvious that we should be actively trying to recognize them and taking steps to keep children from entering the lifestyle in the first place,” she said. .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters) - A minimally invasive procedure that allows doctors to implant a new heart valve supplying blood to the body is safe for low-risk patients, according to a study presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in San Diego. . Low-risk patients were no more likely to suffer stroke, heart attack or death a year after they received the valve implant, compared to those whose diseased valve was replaced  through traditional open heart surgery, results of the Notion trial of 280 Danish patients showed. . While the results using transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are encouraging, more trials that follow larger groups of people for longer periods of time are needed, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. . “We should not interpret these results to suggest that you can have surgery or transcatheter valve replacement in whoever you want,” said Kapadia, who was not involved with the study,      published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. . The results presented Sunday are of particular interest for TAVR makers Medtronic Plc and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. . Their systems are approved for use in patients seen as high risk or deemed too frail to endure open heart surgery. Wider use will hinge on studies of intermediate and lower risk patients to show TAVR is as safe or superior to surgical valve repair. . Patients in the Notion study were mostly considered low-risk for aortic valve replacement. They received a replacement valve either through open-heart surgery or using a TAVR system in which a catheter is used to deliver the new valve to the heart through an artery in the leg or chest. . Researchers led by Copenhagen University Hospital’s Dr. Hans Gustav Thyregod found that about 13 percent of TAVR patients had a stroke, heart attack or died a year after their procedure, versus about 16 percent for traditional surgery. . There were differences in other complications depending on the procedure. . TAVR patients were more likely to need a pacemaker. Surgery patients were more likely to have bleeding, dangerously low blood pressure, new or worse irregular heart rhythms and longer hospital stays. . Another study published in the same journal reports that the use of TAVR appears “safe with acceptable complication rates” among high-risk patients. . Likely due to surgeons becoming more familiar with the technology, complications among TAVR patients decreased over the study period of 2011 through 2013, the researchers report. |Mon Mar 16 17:12:36 +0000 2015||Implanted heart valve safe for low-risk patients: Danish study |5.775178344372838e+17|http://reut.rs/1DsP1VM
Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) - Women who enter science and engineering fields often leave prematurely – and if they stay, many don’t advance as quickly as their male counterparts. Now an academic panel has developed a seven-point plan for achieving gender equity in so-called STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.  . The 28-member Initiative on Women in Science and Engineering Working Group hopes to “ensure that women not just enter science, but remain, compete, and truly excel in scientific careers.”  . Women account for half the college-educated American workforce but only 28 percent of science and engineering workers, according to the National Science Board.  . Susan Solomon, CEO of the New York Stem Cell Foundation, who convened the panel, says STEM fields are too critical to leave behind half the nation’s brainpower. . Two of the panel’s suggestions involve direct financial support but would save money in staff retention, the panelists say. One is flexible family care spending awards that could enable travel to meetings and conferences, for example.  . Another is “extra hands” awards - grants to pay for assistance in the office, laboratory or home.  . Co-author Paola Arlotta, a Harvard University professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, won such an award at Massachusetts General Hospital, where the Claflin Distinguished Scholar Award helps sustain research productivity during child-rearing years. With it, Arlotta hired laboratory help when she was expecting her second child.  . Balancing children and work responsibilities wasn’t her only struggle, however. . “They always boil it down to kids, and I don’t think that is really inclusive of the difficulties we face,” she said. For instance, early in her career, Arlotta needed to seek out female mentors.  . “Personal relationships and institutional change are necessary for people to succeed,” said Dr. Claire Pomeroy, a panelist and president of the Lasker Foundation, which recognizes excellence in medical research.  . When Pomeroy entered medicine, most of her mentors were men. She eventually became dean of the University of California-Davis medical school. “You have to really, really want it, and you have to have people in your life that help you at each stage,” she said.  . Three more suggestions come under a heading of “Psychological and Cultural Strategies.” In a paper in the journal Cell Stem Cell, the panel urges institutions to incorporate implicit bias statements, gender-balanced external review and speaker selection committees, and to focus on education as a tool. . Implicit bias statements could reiterate commitments to equality by search committees, grant makers and conference organizers, they say. For example, Solomon explained, in the rush to book speakers, the most accessible are often confirmed quickly- without an earnest search for other possibilities.  . Therefore, numbers six and seven are gender equity report cards and searchable databases.  . A database of women in STEM fields would make it easier for search committees and conference organizers to identify eligible females, the panel says. . And gender equity report cards, the panelists say, could require institutions to maintain certain scores for funding eligibility.  . Bias must be acknowledged if it’s to be avoided, said Christianne Corbett, an American Association of University Women senior researcher. “We tend to think women are not as competent in fields like science . . . without knowing anything about the people,” she said.  . Corbett, who applauds the report, calls for gender-blind job application reviews.  . “Nothing changes until there’s awareness,” Pomeroy said. “Leadership at the highest levels of research institutions should be aware of these challenges and opportunities.”   . The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation supported the panel.  . SOURCE: .

|PARIS (Reuters) - France’s government is likely to back a bill banning excessively thin fashion models as well as potentially fining the modeling agency or fashion house that hires them and sending the agents to jail, the health minister said on Monday. . Style-conscious France, with its fashion and luxury industries worth tens of billions of euros (dollars), would join Italy, Spain and Israel which all adopted laws against too-thin models on catwalks or in advertising campaigns in early 2013. . “It’s important for fashion models to say that they need to eat well and take care of their health, especially for young women who look to the models as an aesthetic ideal,” Health Minister Marisol Touraine told BFM TV on Monday. . With major health legislation coming up for debate in parliament on March 17, Touraine said the Socialist government was likely to back two amendments relating to models’ weight. . The law would enforce regular weight checks and fines of up to 75,000 euros ($79,000) for any breaches, with up to six months in jail for staff involved, Socialist lawmaker Olivier Veran, who wrote the amendments, told Le Parisien.  . Models would have to present a medical certificate showing a Body Mass Index (BMI) of at least 18, about 55 kg (121 lb) for a height of 1.75 meters (5.7 feet), before being hired for a job and for a few weeks afterwards, he said.  . The bill’s amendments also propose penalties for anything made public that could be seen as encouraging extreme thinness, notably pro-anorexia websites that glorify unhealthy lifestyles. . In 2007, Isabelle Caro, an anorexic 28-year-old former French fashion model, died after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness. . Some 30-40,000 people in France suffer from anorexia, most of them teenagers, said Veran, who is a doctor. |Mon Mar 16 16:00:22 +0000 2015||France likely to pass bill banning super-skinny models |5.774996577246577e+17|http://reut.rs/1DsscBs
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - The rapid spread of a measles outbreak from Disneyland in California to communities around the country suggests that vaccination rates in some places may be as low as 50 percent, a study suggests.  . “Disneyland is an international attraction and sometimes people are coming from places where measles vaccination rates are low or they don’t get the recommended two doses, and that, combined with the fact that there are a lot of pockets of non-vaccination in California and people coming from all over the U.S. created the perfect storm for a big outbreak,” lead author Maimuna Majumder of Boston Children’s Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Reuters Health.  . This year, the U.S. is experiencing a multi-state measles outbreak believed to have started at Disneyland this past December, as well as three other unrelated outbreaks in Illinois, Nevada, and Washington, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of March 6, 173 people from 17 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles, with most linked back to Disneyland.  . Measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious or even fatal. It starts with a fever that can last a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and pink eye. A rash develops on the face and neck then spreads to the rest of the body. In severe cases, pneumonia and encephalitis can develop.  . People with measles can be spreading the virus for four days before and after the rash appears, according to the CDC.  . The virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces where an infected person coughs or sneezes. People who breathe the contaminated air or touch an infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth can become infected. . About 96 to 99 percent of people in the community need to be vaccinated against measles to effectively halt its spread. Because about 7 percent of people won’t get immunity from one dose of the vaccine, two doses are recommended in the U.S.  . Before the vaccine was developed, each person with measles typically infected 11 to 18 others, Majumder and colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics.  . Based on historical infection rates and the number of individuals infected in the current outbreak, the researchers estimate that vaccination rates in some communities might be as low as 50 percent and probably are no higher than 86 percent. . “Clearly, based on the number of infections we have seen so far, we can say that (the current vaccination rate) is far below the level necessary to achieve herd immunity,” Majumder said. . The timing of the current outbreak, starting during school vacations for many people in the U.S., likely made measles spread more quickly, said Dr. George Rutherford, vice chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, in a phone interview.  . “There’s nothing magic about Disneyland except that there are a lot of people there,” said Rutherford, who wasn’t involved in the study. “If anything, because it’s outdoors and so spread out, it might be a little harder to transmit.” . Still, mixing tourists from countries where vaccination rates are low, with U.S. kids whose parents don’t vaccinate them for medical or personal reasons, is a likely cause of the current outbreak, he said.  . “In this scenario, any one child with measles is going to quickly spread it to just about every other child around them who isn’t already immune,” Rutherford said.  .

Jim Drury|London, England, UK - European biologists have discovered a bacteria-killing compound in common mushrooms that grow in horse dung. Unusually for an antibiotic, copsin is a protein; but laboratory trials showed it to have the same effect on bacteria as traditional antibiotics. . Chemists around the world are involved in a race against time to find a solution to the growing problem of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. It’s a major threat to the health of the global population, which had long assumed that antibiotics would always be available to cure bacterial illness. . The scientific community hopes to be able to develop a new range of antibiotics to replace those that are increasingly losing their ability to work against infections like Tuberculosis (TB). A research team led by Markus Aebi, Professor of Mycology at ETH Zurich (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich), believe they may have found the answer. . They discovered copsin in the common inky cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea that grows on manure, while researching how the fungus and various bacteria affected each other’s growth. According to lead researcher, post-doc Andreas Essig, horse manure’s rich substrate is key. . “Horse dung is a very rich substrate that harbours a diversity of micro-organisms, including fungi and bacteria,” said Essig. “Now these micro-organisms are in a constant competition for nutrients and space and it’s therefore very likely to find potent antibiotics in such an environment, which are used by the different organisms to inhibit the growth of the competitors.” . Essig and his colleagues from ETH Zurich and the University of Bonn cultivated the fungus in a laboratory, along with several different types of bacteria, and found that C. cinerea killed certain bacteria. Further research demonstrated that the copsin produced by the mushroom was responsible for this antibiotic effect. . “Now copsin kills bacteria by binding to an essential cell wall building block,” said Essig. “The cell wall you can consider like the achilles heel of bacteria, so when you disrupt the cell wall synthesis bacteria usually dies rapidly. The binding pattern of copsin on this building block is very unique and therefore copsin is active against bacteria resistant to conventional antibiotics.” . Copsin is a protein, whereas traditional antibiotics are often non-protein organic compounds. It belongs to the group of defensins, a class of small proteins produced by numerous to counter disease-causing micro-organisms. In fact, the human body produces defensins in the skin and mucous membranes to protect itself against infections. . To yield larger amounts of the antibiotic, copsin is produced in liquid culture via a methylotrophic yeast called Pichia pastoris. Speaking in the ETH Zurich laboratory while producing copsin, senior scientist PaulI Kallio said: “We are growing Pichia pastoris, which is a methylotrophic yeast and in this yeast we are producing copsin, so this is a long process, and that is why we are using bioreactors which then provides controlled and sterile environment for copsin production.” . Kallio says the cultivation process takes five days, before cells can be harvested and copsin extracted. . Essig says copsin’s inherent stability is crucial to its potential use and that it could be useful in the food industry, because it kills pathogens such as Listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause severe food poisoning. “Copsin is an exceptionally stable protein, so you can for example boil it at 100 degrees, you can put it in strong acid for hours,” he said. “You can also treat it with very aggressive enzymes and it remains completely active. This feature allows us, for example, also to go into applications in food industry, food preservation, productions where strong acids in high temperatures are very common.” . Aebi says it is not certain whether copsin could be used in an antibiotic, but that even if it cannot it remains important research. He is intrigued by what he calls the fundamental question of how fungi have used defensins and other naturally antibiotic substances for millions of years to protect themselves against bacteria, while antibiotics used in medicine by humans have developed resistance in just 70 years. . The team has registered copsin for patent approval.|Mon Mar 16 11:50:29 +0000 2015||Horse dung has scientists on scent of antibiotic success |5.774367727387197e+17|http://reut.rs/1DrwTLZ
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - New clinical trial results with AstraZeneca’s heart drug Brilinta are positive but bleeding risks suggest the company’s sales force still has its work cut out to get the medicine widely adopted for long-term use. . AstraZeneca is relying on Brilinta, which it believes can sell $3.5 billion annually by 2023, to help offset a wave of patent losses on older drugs. The product was a central plank in its defense against a takeover bid by Pfizer last year. . Key to Brilinta’s success is widening its use beyond acute care to a broader group of heart patients — something the large 21,000-patient clinical trial showed was possible as it cuts heart risks significantly, albeit at the price of more bleeding. . Shares in the drugmaker, which rose last week ahead of presentation of the PEGASUS trial at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting, slipped back on Monday before recovering as investors digested the results. . Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum said the results were “good but not great”, while Seamus Fernandez of Leerink said the outcome was “far from an epiphany” for cardiology medicine. . Encouragingly, there was no excess of fatal or irreversible bleeding into the brain with long-term Brilinta use, which would have been a serious deterrent against its use. . But an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine was cautious about Brilinta’s potential, noting that for each 10,000 patients treated, it would prevent 42 cardiovascular events annually but cause 31 major bleeds, which was described as “close to an even proposition”. . The current standard care for patients more than one year on from a heart attack is aspirin alone to prevent clotting, but AstraZeneca wanted to prove the case for dual therapy by adding Brilinta to the mix. . The editorial said the data would “prompt speculation as to whether dual platelet inhibition with high-potency agents is approaching the point of diminishing returns”. . In practice, many doctors may be selective about using Brilinta and some will likely opt instead to use Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s older drug Plavix, since it is now available as a cheap generic. . Richard Parkes of Deutsche Bank said long-term Brilinta use was likely to be limited to highly selected patents with low risk of bleeding complications and particularly high cardiovascular risk.  . Analyst forecasts currently suggest Brilinta sales of $1.5 billion by 2020, against $476 million in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis. |Mon Mar 16 09:48:49 +0000 2015||AstraZeneca heart drug results positive but not knock-out |5.774061543446282e+17|http://reut.rs/1DramPi
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are considering imposing tougher restrictions in Arkansas to contain a virulent strain of avian flu in the heart of America’s poultry region in a bid to minimize international trade disruptions and contain the virus. . The H5N2 flu discovered in Arkansas last week is the state’s first case of a strain that causes massive internal hemorrhaging in poultry, can kill nearly every bird in an infected flock within 48 hours, and is prone to mutate. Such strains are sometimes called “chicken Ebola.” . In response, Arkansas is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to create new rules for commercial poultry producers and owners of backyard flocks alike, Reuters has learned. . The rules will spell out how often poultry within a quarantine zone must test negative for bird flu before the quarantine can be lifted, Brandon Doss, Arkansas’ assistant state veterinarian, said. Until the quarantine is lifted, no poultry within 10 km (6 miles) around the farm that was infected with bird flu can move in or out of the area. .    The rules being revised were previously used to deal with less deadly strains of the bird flu in Arkansas. . U.S. authorities are seeking to reassure major buyers of U.S. chicken, such as Mexico, which imposed new import restrictions last week. The export market for companies like Tyson Foods Inc and JBS SA unit Pilgrim’s Pride Corp is worth $5.7 billion annually. . Already, Arkansas has established a quarantine zone around a farm infected with H5N2 and ordered a 24-hour guard to monitor trucks and people entering and leaving the site and block unauthorized access. . “In all likelihood it will be our largest response effort to date,” Doss said. Arkansas has 42 commercial operations and at least two dozen backyard flocks to monitor within its quarantine zone. . Other states with recent H5N2 cases, including Minnesota and Missouri, have also established quarantine zones around infected farms and are testing nearby flocks in line with existing U.S. requirements. . Kansas last week imposed a quarantine in two counties even before a case of the flu was confirmed on Friday. They took action because of worry about an infection in neighboring Missouri.  . GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR . But it is the Arkansas infection, in particular, that is causing concern among poultry producers and investors in chicken companies like Tyson and Sanderson Farms Inc, because the state is among the top chicken and turkey producers and is near other major poultry states like Mississippi and Alabama. . Arkansas poultry have previously suffered from milder cases of low pathogenic avian flu, which can cause reduced egg production and respiratory difficulties, among other symptoms. During those outbreaks, flocks needed to test negative for the virus in a minimum of two tests administered 10 days apart before quarantines were lifted, Doss said. . For the more deadly strain discovered last week, “we have not set that time frame or that protocol yet,” he said. “It is still in development with USDA.” . It is not known whether states other than Arkansas are working with the USDA on new surveillance protocols.     . Butterball LLC, the largest U.S. producer of turkey products, contracts to buy birds from the Arkansas farm infected with the virus.  . Arkansas livestock inspectors, divided into six teams of two people, are going door-to-door to nearly 1,900 properties within the quarantine zone to search for backyard flocks that could potentially be infected, Doss said. . As of late on Friday, they had visited 256 properties and identified 24 with backyard flocks. All will be subject to the new protocols under discussion by the USDA and the state.  |Mon Mar 16 05:25:29 +0000 2015||U.S. may impose tougher curbs to contain bird flu in Arkansas |5.773398828273541e+17|http://reut.rs/1BnEzHZ
Brendan O'Brien|(Reuters) - Four Americans who may have been exposed to the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone have arrived in the United States and are being observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the hospital said on Sunday.   . The individuals arrived on Saturday and are being housed on the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus in Omaha, where medical personnel will monitor them for 21 days for any Ebola symptoms, hospital spokesman Taylor Wilson said.   . “They’re not sick and not contagious,” Wilson said.  . A U.S. healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while in Sierra Leone arrived at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland on Friday and was in serious condition, the NIH said. . The people under observation in Nebraska are among at least 10 Americans flown to the United States by non-commercial air transport who may have been exposed to the unidentified Ebola patient in Sierra Leone or had a similar exposure to the virus as the patient. . While the virus has killed about 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, only a handful of cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain, almost all of them contracted in West Africa. . A debate in the United States arose last fall on how mandatory quarantines in a number of states for health workers returning from Ebola-ravaged West African countries could potentially discourage potential medical volunteers. . Wilson said he could not provide the genders of any of the patients in Nebraska or any other details about them.    . The other individuals are expected to be monitored at the NIH or at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the CDC said. . CDC officials and officials in Maryland and Atlanta were not immediately available for comment on Sunday.  . The CDC had said all the individuals who were being flown back to the United States were free of symptoms. . On Friday, CDC sent a team to Sierra Leone to investigate how the healthcare worker had become infected, and determine who might have been in contact with the worker. |Mon Mar 16 00:08:10 +0000 2015||Four Americans arrive in Nebraska to be monitored for Ebola virus |5.772600270875771e+17|http://reut.rs/1BmVoTm

Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - Researchers on Sunday presented trial data showing very low mortality and stroke rates using the third generation version of Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s non-invasive heart valve replacement system that could help support its U.S. approval. . Data compiled 30 days after the procedure showed a 2.2 percent mortality rate in high risk patients and a 1.1 percent death rate among intermediate risk patients whose diseased heart valves were replaced using the Edwards Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system. . The rate for all strokes at 30 days was 1.5 percent for high risk patients and 2.6 percent for the intermediate risk group. The disabling stroke rates were 0.86 percent and 1 percent. . “The numbers that we’re seeing are truly phenomenal,” said    Dr. Susheel Kodali, the study’s co-primary investigator, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology  meeting in San Diego. “This is a sick population.”    . The results demonstrated a clear improvement over those seen in prior studies of two earlier Sapien iterations and compared favorably to historical complication expectations for surgical valve replacement, Kodali said. For example, the mortality rate for high risk patients in a trial of the original Sapien was over 5 percent, he explained. . TAVR is increasingly being used as an alternative to open heart surgery in patients seen as high risk or deemed too frail to endure surgery. . They are considered the most important near-term growth drivers for Edwards and rival Medtronic Plc. The companies have been testing them in lower risk patients with the hope of widening approvals and use. . The Sapien 3 features a smaller catheter to deliver the valve to the heart than its predecessors, and an improved design aimed at minimizing valve leakage. It has been in use in Europe for high risk and inoperable patients since early 2014. Edwards is hoping to gain U.S. approval in early 2016. . The study involved 583 high risk and 1,076 intermediate risk patients with an average age of about 82. . The combined rate of moderate or severe valve leakage was under four percent. “In terms of reducing significant perivalvular leak, the rates are extremely low,” said Kodali, director of the Heart Valve Center at Columbia New York Presbyterian Hospital.  . In coming years, Kodali said, he envisions TAVR will no longer be viewed as a secondary option. “The conversation will be who’s going to be getting surgery in the era of TAVR.” |Sun Mar 15 18:14:51 +0000 2015||Low mortality, stroke seen with newest Edwards TAVR system: study |5.771711145872507e+17|http://reut.rs/1BlZLOB
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - Patients treated with Medtronic Plc’s CoreValve non-invasive heart valve replacement system fared better two years after the procedure than those who underwent surgical valve replacement, according to data from a study presented on Sunday. . The data not only showed that results seen at one year were sustained a year later, but that there were greater differences favoring Medtronic’s transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) compared with open heart surgery. . The rate of all-cause mortality or major stroke at two years was 24.2 percent for CoreValve versus 32.5 percent for surgery. The result was deemed highly statistically significant and was a greater difference than one-year rates of 16.2 percent and 22.5 percent. . The difference in all-cause mortality alone and for all strokes in the trial of 750 high-risk patients also favored TAVR by a wider margin at two years. . For all strokes, the rate after two years was 10.9 percent for CoreValve versus 16.6 percent for surgery. . “This data is strong enough that it should change our guidelines in the increased risk surgical population where TAVR is not just an alternative to surgery, but it should be the preferred option,” said Dr. Michael Reardon, the study’s primary investigator, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in San Diego. . TAVR systems are considered the most important future growth driver for Medtronic and rival Edwards Lifesciences Corp. Evidence of their long-term durability is seen as critical to advancing physician acceptance. The procedure involves threading the new valve into place in the heart through an artery as an alternative to open heart surgery. . It had been believed that TAVR would have a hard time competing with surgical results, Reardon said.  . “We did really good surgery and at two years there was a survival advantage (for TAVR) that was highly statistically significant,” said Reardon, a professor of cardio thoracic surgery at Houston Methodist Debakey Heart & Vascular Center. . Echocardiographic findings of how well the valves performed also favored CoreValve, researchers said. . Analyses of various patient subgroups, such older or younger than 80, by gender, severity of risk and whether patients had previously undergone coronary bypass procedures, all favored CoreValve, researchers found. . “When you look at the way the field is going, for me as a cardiac surgeon it may not be that great, but for our patients it’s really groundbreaking,” Reardon said. |Sun Mar 15 18:14:46 +0000 2015||Medtronic valve replacement tops surgery after two years: study |5.771710917450588e+17|http://reut.rs/1DoB5fo
Deena Beasley|San Diego (Reuters) - Studies of a new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs signal that they can reduce by half the risk of heart attack and other major cardiovascular problems compared to standard treatment alone.  . Doctors at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, where the studies were presented, called the results “encouraging,” but said larger, controlled trials are needed to fully understand the drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors.     . An analysis of about 4,500 patients who stayed on treatment for nearly a year after completing earlier trials of Amgen Inc’s Repatha, also known as evolocumab, found that 0.95 percent of those given the drug and standard therapy suffered a cardiovascular event, compared with 2.18 percent of the group on standard treatment, which ranged from diet changes to drugs such as statins. . Amgen defined “event” as death, heart attack, stroke or “mini-stroke,” unstable chest pain or heart failure requiring hospitalization, or the need for a procedure to restore bloodflow to the heart. . Side effects more frequent, but still rare, in patients treated with Repatha included neurocognitive problems, such as confusion, something the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said should be monitored closely. . Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s head of cardiovascular and metabolic therapies, told Reuters that the company does not believe there is a safety issue. . Neurocognitive side effects were also more common in the treatment arm of an 18-month, 2,300-patient trial of a rival PCSK9 drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. . The drug, Praluent, was shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems from 3.3 percent for placebo patients to 1.7 percent for the treatment group. “Events” in this trial were defined only as death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalization. . “Some of the endpoints in these trials are kind of soft, and they aren’t prospective studies,” said Dr. Anthony DeMaria, director of the cardiovascular center at the University of California San Diego who was not involved in the trials. “It’s encouraging that the larger trials are likely to succeed, but we still need those trials.”  . Dr Marc Sabatine, lead investigator of the Repatha study, said data for both drugs “are very consistent ... it appears that cutting LDL by 61 percent translates to a roughly 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular events.” . Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, but investors expect widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems. . The experimental drugs are antibodies, given by injection, designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins - pills, now available as low-cost generics, that block the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol in the first place. . Both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have filed for FDA approval of their drugs, based on trials showing that they lower LDL in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. . The FDA is slated to decide on Amgen’s application for Repatha by Aug. 27, while the regulatory deadline for Praluent, also known as alirocumab, is July 24. . Health insurers are already bracing for the impact on drug spending. Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, projects an annual cost as high as $10,000 per patient for PCSK9 drugs, which it says could be used for 10 million Americans. . Both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron do not expect definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes for their drugs until larger trials conclude in 2017. Pfizer Inc,, which has not yet filed for regulatory approval of its PCSK9 drug, said it expects outcomes data in a similar time frame. |Sun Mar 15 15:41:49 +0000 2015||Experimental cholesterol drugs cut heart risk, but questions remain |5.771326028108513e+17|http://reut.rs/1BlBqZr
Bill Berkrot|NEW YORK (Reuters) - As drugmakers develop new medicines to battle a liver disease epidemic, they have created an urgent need for better diagnostics to select patients for treatment and assess their drugs’ effectiveness. . About 30 percent of people in the U.S. now suffer from fatty liver diseases, such as NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), fueled by obesity, diabetes and over-indulgent lifestyles, according to the American Liver Foundation. Without treatment, sufferers can develop advanced damage, including the scarring known as fibrosis; cirrhosis, which destroys liver function; and even cancer. . For now, testing patients in trials of experimental medicines involves a liver biopsy, a painful, expensive and potentially risky test. Its accuracy is also limited as it draws just a tiny piece of the liver, which may not be affected uniformly by disease.  . “It’s a pretty nasty test involving a needle five inches long you plunge blindly into a patient’s side,” said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean of therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world’s top liver disease experts. “We don’t like to do them. You can’t do more than one at the beginning, one at the end (of a trial). So there’s this frantic effort now to develop (diagnostics) that will give us the information necessary to know if a drug is working.” . More than a dozen drugmakers are working on new treatments for fatty liver disease. Frontrunners include Gilead Sciences Inc, a leader in the hepatitis C field, Intercept Pharmaceuticals and France’s Genfit. If approved, each of their drugs could reap sales of $10 billion annually, Reuters reported last year. . They will find eager partners in several small companies, such as KineMed and Perspectum Diagnostics, often spawned from academic or hospital research, which are working on alternatives to liver biopsy. . Some of the new techniques use MRI scans that view the entire liver. Others involve blood tests to measure liver scarring or function. One diagnostic evaluates liver damage via exhaled breath. They could replace biopsy or be used to provide interim results during lengthy studies. . U.S. health regulators “recognize that biopsy is an inadequate way to power trials,” Friedman said. “We can’t get interim data about efficacy.” . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to discuss tests in development. The agency “supports innovation, especially where new tests and diagnostic procedures might eliminate or decrease the need for an invasive procedure such as a liver biopsy,” a spokesman said. . New diagnostics will also help U.S. health insurers determine which patients are most in need of treatment to keep a closer watch on cost. Gilead’s hepatitis C cure Sovaldi racked up $10.3 billion in its first year on the market, prompting a campaign by U.S. payers to reduce the cost of new medications. . “Who is at risk for progressing to serious liver disease? That’s a giant question,” said Marc Hellerstein, president and chief scientific officer of KineMed and a professor of nutritional science and toxicology at the University of California, Berkeley. “We cannot possibly treat 60 million people for a new disease with expensive new medicines.” . KineMed’s test has a patient drink a small amount of water with the non-radioactive hydrogen molecule, deuterium, which accumulates in new collagen, the main component of fibrotic scarring. Using a highly sensitive mass spectrometer, KineMed can distinguish in a small blood sample how much collagen is being made. The information could tell companies whether a drug is working in a month versus years. . “If you’ve reduced the scar formation rate by 50 percent, then you know that in a year or two that’s going to add up,” Hellerstein said. . KineMed, which is eyeing going public perhaps late this year or early 2016, is in talks with several drugmakers on using its test in clinical trials, Hellerstein said. . Collagen Medical, which was spun out of research at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital, has developed a contrast agent that binds to collagen and uses MRI to provide a 3D image of the whole liver. . “If you have liver fibrosis then that part of the liver becomes very bright in the MRI scan,” said company co-founder Peter Caravan, director of the Institute for Innovation and Imaging at Mass General. The company expects to begin testing on humans for both liver and cardiac fibrosis with help from grants from the National Institutes of Health. . Perspectum Diagnostics, started by Oxford University researchers, has another MRI-based test that won U.K. approval last year. . Chief Executive Rajarshi Banerjee said he was stunned by the prevalence of liver disease he found during a medical rotation in the Channel Islands off the coast of Normandy, France, which have a reputation as a tax haven for the rich . “You had very wealthy women presenting in their 50s with end-stage liver disease,” he said. “You don’t expect that in the U.K. equivalent of the Hamptons.” . His company’s Liver MultiScan takes about 15 minutes and offers easy-to-read full liver images that measure inflammation, fibrosis and iron build-up, producing a score that can determine need for medical intervention. It could also help select patients for clinical trials depending on whether a drug is targeting inflammation or fibrosis. . He shared with Reuters an image of the liver of a 12-year-old boy with a 41-inch waist whose advanced NASH was obvious even to an untrained eye, with large areas of the liver showing dense fat deposits. . “The chances of this boy reaching pensionable age are minuscule unless we do something about it,” Banerjee said. “It’s a sad indictment of the way we live.” . Raptor Pharmaceuticals is testing a drug in children whose NASH was confirmed through biopsy. Having non-invasive tests or biomarkers that can prove a drug works would be “a giant leap forward for the field,” Raptor CEO Julie Anne Smith said. . Aurora, Colorado-based HepQuant has discussed using its blood test with Gilead and others, said company founder Greg Everson, who’s also director of hepatology at the medical school at the University of Colorado, Denver. Patients either drink or are injected with a liquid that contains a non-radioactive molecule. A series of blood tests over 90 minutes measures how it is cleared by the body, providing information on liver function and physiology.  . “We found that the test had tremendous sensitivity over the full range of liver disease, not just at late stage,” Everson said. “We’re hoping we can work with the FDA to set a pathway that’s not too onerous and get this available quickly.” . The idea of a breath test for liver function has been around for decades, but Israeli-based Exalenz Bioscience Ltd may be the first to bring one to market. . A patient drinks a small amount of water containing a non therapeutic drug that interacts with the liver. Breath exhaled through the nose is measured for an isotope, C13, which is released in carbon dioxide. The less C13, the higher the likelihood of poor liver function, said Exalenz CEO Lawrence Cohen. . “We’ve got extremely good results that correlate with biopsies,” he said.  |Sun Mar 15 12:59:41 +0000 2015||New market for liver disease spawns race for better testing |5.77091800743211e+17|http://reut.rs/1Blbe11
|(Reuters) - At least 10 Americans possibly exposed to the deadly Ebola virus were being flown to the United States from Sierra Leone for observation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday. . They will be transported by non-commercial air transport and will be housed near the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, or Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the CDC said. . All of the individuals who are being flown back to the United States are free of symptoms, the CDC said. . A U.S. healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while in Sierra Leone arrived at the NIH on Friday and was in serious condition, the NIH said. . It is not clear how the person became infected with Ebola, CDC said. . While the virus has killed about 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, only a handful of cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain. . CDC spokesman Thomas Skinner said 10 people who may have been exposed to the unidentified Ebola patient or who had a similar exposure to the virus as the patient were being flown to the United States. But he said the investigation was continuing and there may be more Americans evacuated from Africa. . A CDC statement said the 10 individuals will follow the center’s recommended monitoring and movement guidelines during the 21-day incubation period. . If someone shows symptoms, they will be transported to an Ebola treatment center for evaluation and care, the CDC said. . On Friday, CDC sent a team to Sierra Leone to investigate how the healthcare worker became exposed, and determine who might have been in contact with the infected person. . CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes did not know where all of the patients would be sent, but he said the CDC is working out a plan with the U.S. State Department to determine who is coming back and where they will be sent. .  The CDC said one patient was being sent to Emory University Hospital’s special isolation unit, where several Ebola patients have already been treated.  . Four others are being sent to Nebraska Medical Center to be near their special isolation unit in case they develop Ebola symptoms.  |Sat Mar 14 20:01:48 +0000 2015||At least 10 people flown to U.S. after possible Ebola exposure: CDC |5.768356410503291e+17|http://reut.rs/1BiEZiX
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the first infection of a virulent strain of avian flu in poultry in Kansas, confirming the virus has spread into a migratory bird route that runs through the center of the country. . The discovery of the H5N2 flu strain in a backyard chicken and duck flock in a county just outside Kansas City, Kan., is certain to lead to expanded restrictions on U.S. poultry exports from top trading partners like Mexico and Canada.  . The infection, confirmed on Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was the first case in an established migratory bird route, known as the central flyway, that stretches roughly north-south from Montana to Texas.     . Kansas officials quarantined the infected property in Leavenworth County, and birds there will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease. A quarantine zone will be established for miles around the site to limit the movement of poultry. . “We are dedicated to providing the necessary assistance and precautions to avoid any possible spreading of the disease,” said Bill Brown, Kansas’ animal health commissioner, . The USDA will inform international trading partners and an international animal health organization of the infection. Major buyers of U.S. poultry have already restricted imports from other states that have recently been infected with the same flu strain. . Last week, the USDA identified the first case in Arkansas, in the heart of the U.S. poultry-producing region. . Molecular testing has shown the virus found in recent infections is nearly identical to viruses isolated in migratory ducks. But some wildlife experts are skeptical of suggestions that wild birds are responsible for spreading the flu in the Midwest. . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk to people from highly pathogenic flu infections in wild birds and poultry to be low, according to the USDA statement. |Sat Mar 14 17:01:45 +0000 2015||USDA reports virulent strain of avian flu in Kansas poultry |5.767903313137705e+17|http://reut.rs/1DksRov
|TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - An American who was hospitalized in Honduras pending Ebola checks has been released from hospital, authorities said on Saturday, though he will be kept under watch for 21 days. . The 66-year-old American had spent time in Liberia before coming to Honduras on March 11, authorities said. He was hospitalized on Friday in Comayagua, about an hour north of Tegucigalpa, with a fever.  . The vice minister of health, Francis Contreras, said the American did not have any symptoms of Ebola, but authorities are being extra careful because he came from a country that has been affected by the epidemic.  . “We strongly dismiss that as of now, we have a patient with Ebola in the country,” Contreras told reporters. |Sat Mar 14 16:34:44 +0000 2015||American in Honduras checked for Ebola released from hospital |5.767835301995561e+17|http://reut.rs/1DkozgQ
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Long-term use of AstraZeneca’s drug Brilinta can cut the risk of death, another heart attack or stroke in patients with a history of past attacks by 16 percent, a keenly awaited clinical trial showed on Saturday. . The finding may boost sales of the blood-thinner, which AstraZeneca is relying on to drive growth, although doctors must balance its benefits against bleeding risks. . “There will be more bleeding, but I think the benefit for patients in terms of reducing their risk of dying or having another heart attack or stroke outweighs that,” trial researcher Marc Sabatine of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital told Reuters. . Importantly, there was no excess of fatal or irreversible bleeding into the brain. . John Keaney of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who was not involved in the study, said there was a “fragile balance” to be struck in using potent blood-thinners that can trigger bleeding. . He noted that for each 10,000 patients treated, Brilinta would prevent 42 cardiovascular events annually but cause 31 major bleeds. . The current standard care for patients more than one year on from a heart attack is aspirin alone to prevent clotting, so adding Brilinta would open a major new sales opportunity. . Until now Brilinta has struggled to gain traction, though AstraZeneca flagged its potential to sell $3.5 billion annually by 2023 when it fought off a takeover bid by Pfizer last year.  . Analyst forecasts currently suggest sales of $1.5 billion by 2020, against $476 million in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis. . AstraZeneca had said previously the 21,000-patient trial, its biggest ever, was positive but details were only unveiled at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting, with simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. . Among patients on twice-a-day 60-mg Brilinta plus aspirin, 7.77 percent suffered adverse cardiovascular events against 9.04 percent for the aspirin-only group, a relative risk reduction of 16 percent. For 90-mg Brilinta, the risk reduction was 15 percent. . There was major bleeding in 2.30 percent of 60-mg Brilinta patients against 1.06 percent for those taking aspirin only. . AstraZeneca’s Brilinta head, Tom Keith-Roach, sees the study boosting sales and doubling the number of eligible patients. “I think it is going to strengthen our trajectory,” he said. . Brilinta competes with Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s older drug Plavix, now available as a cheap generic, and Eli Lilly’s Effient. . AstraZeneca recently filed for long-term use of Brilinta in Europe and the United States, based on the latest trial results, which showed that the benefit from taking Brilinta continued to accrue for nearly three years.  |Sat Mar 14 15:11:30 +0000 2015||Long-term use of AstraZeneca heart drug brings benefits, some risks |5.767625828429373e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dk9PP6
|TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen has been hospitalized in Honduras while he is screened for Ebola, health authorities in the Central American country said on Friday.  . The 66-year-old American, who has not been identified, had spent time in Liberia before coming to Honduras on March 11, authorities said.  . Although he didn’t have any symptoms when he arrived in the country, he was hospitalized with a 100.4 degree fever on Friday in Comayagua, about an hour north of the capital Tegucigalpa, an owner of the hospital, Juviny Ochoa, told Reuters.  . The deputy minister of health, Francis Contreras, told local television that authorities were taking precautions because the patient had been in an African country.  . “We have adopted international health protocols to treat these kinds of cases,” Contreras said. |Sat Mar 14 06:02:15 +0000 2015||American in Honduras isolated pending tests for Ebola |5.766243590009733e+17|http://reut.rs/1Bglxn2
Kevin Murphy|KANSAS CITY, Kan. (Reuters) - Three Kansas hospital patients have died and two have been sickened by listeriosis linked to single-serve Blue Bell Creameries ice cream products since last year, health officials said on Friday. . The five adults became ill from January 2014 to January of this year with one of four rare strains of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria while hospitalized with unrelated illnesses, Kansas health officials said in a news release. . The Kansas Department of Health and Environment declined to identify the hospital. . Three strains of the bacteria were found in products made at privately held Blue Bell Creameries’ main facility at Brenham, Texas, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is investigating the contamination. . Hospital records that were available on four of the patients showed they had been served Blue Bell ice cream products, but it was not clear if these products came from Brenham, the FDA said. . Blue Bell said it traced the problem to one machine that produced a limited number of snack items, and that it has shut down the line where the products were made. It was the first product recall for the 108-year-old company, it said. . The FDA contacted Blue Bell about the illnesses four weeks ago and the company has retrieved the products, said Ricky Dickson, Blue Bell vice president of sales. . “You shouldn’t find any of this product on the market,” Dickson said in a telephone interview. . Listeriosis is a rare, potentially fatal illness caused by food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. . The condition, which primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weak immunity, causes  fever and muscle aches. . It is sometimes preceded by diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. |Sat Mar 14 01:11:50 +0000 2015||Three Kansas patients die after eating tainted ice cream |5.765512735221637e+17|http://reut.rs/1DhTASI
|(Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp said on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its device to prevent stroke in patients with a dangerous irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation (AF). . The tiny umbrella-shaped product, called the Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, is designed to spare heart patients a lifetime of taking anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin, that carry a high risk of bleeding. . The device will be made available to U.S. centers involved in Boston Scientific’s clinical studies and additional specialized centers, the company said. . People with AF, the most common type of arrhythmia, are five times more likely to suffer a stroke than those without the condition. AF currently affects more than five million Americans. . The device is implanted using a thin catheter and secured on the left atrial appendage, a thumb-sized muscular pouch connected to the left atrium of the heart. It captures clots, preventing them from being dislodged and moving to the brain. . The product, which Boston Scientific acquired when it bought Atritech in 2011, has been commercially available in regions outside the United States since 2009. |Fri Mar 13 23:30:33 +0000 2015||Boston Scientific wins U.S. approval for atrial fibrillation device |5.76525788348072e+17|http://reut.rs/1BfqegT
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating bacterial contamination in some products made by Blue Bell Creameries, the maker of Blue Bell brand icecreams, after reports of three deaths in a Kansas hospital. . Five patients at the hospital were infected with one of four rare strains of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, the FDA said on Friday, citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.  . Three of these four strains of the bacteria have also been found in products made at privately-held Blue Bell Creameries’ main factory at Brenham, Texas.   . Hospital records of four patients show that they were served icecream products from the company, but it was not clear if these products came from the Brenham factory.  . The FDA said Blue Bell Creameries reported that it had pulled the affected products off the shelves at retailers and hospitals. The company has also shut down the production line where the products were made. . The 108-year-old company said on its website that this was its first ever product recall.  .

|(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said it expects its long-delayed drug to reverse the effects of anesthesia to be denied U.S. approval after U.S. regulators said they need to conduct more site inspections related to a study of the drug. . Merck on Friday said it expects a so-called complete response letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by April 22. Such letters indicate that the agency is unwilling to approve a drug until certain conditions are met. . A March 18 meeting of an independent FDA medical advisory panel to discuss the company’s resubmitted marketing application has been canceled, Merck said, adding that the company will continue to work with the FDA as the agency completes its review. . Sugammadex, which reverses the effects of muscle relaxants after surgery, is already approved in more than 50 countries. . Cowen & Co, a brokerage, has estimated that sugammadex, if approved in the United States, could capture annual sales of $550 million by 2020, which would make it a moderate-sized product for Merck. It is sold overseas under the brand name Bridion.  . It was developed by Schering Plough, a rival U.S. drugmaker acquired by Merck in 2009, and has been billed by the drugmakers for years as a potential major advance in speeding recovery of patients from anesthesia. . The FDA rejected the injectable drug in 2008, citing concerns about a possible association with allergic reactions and bleeding. |Fri Mar 13 20:59:58 +0000 2015||Merck expects to be denied approval for sugammadex injection again |5.764878922871685e+17|http://reut.rs/1DgM22u
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A virulent strain of avian flu that has killed turkeys in the heart of the nation’s poultry region has been found through molecular testing to be nearly identical to viruses isolated in migratory ducks.  . But some wildlife experts are skeptical of suggestions that wild birds are responsible for spreading the H5N2 flu strain that has infected poultry in Minnesota, Missouri and Arkansas. . A top investigator from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says that testing performed by the government supports a conclusion that the virus is being carried by waterfowl along an established migratory route that stretches south from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. The virus can be transmitted to poultry from ducks through droppings that land on farms or when birds interact, among other ways.    . “That’s the way we’re sort of pointing right now: to ducks as the problem,” said Brian McCluskey, lead epidemiologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The agency has not, however, identified how the disease made its way from the ducks to domestic fowl.  . Experts who doubt that wild birds are spreading the virus note that the disease has moved from Minnesota in the north, south to Arkansas and Missouri, the opposite direction birds migrate through the area in the spring.  . “When you’re talking about where I would put my money, I would say that north to south movement in the beginning of March totally does not make sense,” said Hon Ip, a microbiologist for the National Wildlife Health Center. . Determining how avian flu is spreading is crucial to preventing future outbreaks, protecting poultry and limiting damage in the $5.7 billion export market. Already, the outbreak has prompted top poultry importers, including Mexico and Canada, to widen trade restrictions.  . Previous outbreaks on the West Coast were linked to wild fowl by the USDA. But the virus can be spread in other ways, too, including through contaminated trucks, humans or animal feed. People can carry infected material, such as feces or even feathers, to farms on their clothes, shoes or vehicles. . Once it arrives, avian flu can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 24 hours. The virus has not been identified in humans and is not expected to pose a public health risk, according to the USDA. . The infection in a Minnesota turkey flock was the first along the migratory route known as the Mississippi flyway, which also includes Missouri and Arkansas — and continues southeast toward the major chicken producing states of Mississippi and Alabama. . After the Minnesota case was identified on March 5, the USDA organized a call to advise state veterinarians along the route that the virus could be headed in their direction, said Richard Fordyce, director of Missouri’s Department of Agriculture. . But wildlife experts question whether wild birds are moving the virus along the flyway. . “It is extraordinarily unlikely that avian influenza in the turkey flock in Minnesota has anything to do with wild birds,” said Lou Cornicelli, wildlife research manager for the Minnesota Division of Fish and Wildlife . He noted that few migratory ducks have started arriving in Minnesota. . “I would think the investigation is going to look more toward the biosecurity issue with food or transport,” Cornicelli added. “The fact that there are no ducks here would indicate that it’s not ducks in Minnesota.” . One day after the USDA confirmed avian flu in Minnesota, state wildlife employees took a low-level airplane flight to scout a 15-mile radius around an infected turkey farm for wild birds that could have carried the virus.  . They spotted just 18 swans and 100 ducks, and they appeared to be “city birds” that do not migrate, Cornicelli said. The state nevertheless tested feces from some of the ducks for avian flu, but the results were negative. . Arkansas officials doubt the role of migratory birds in their state’s outbreak, too, partly because the area with the infected farm does not attract many wild birds and waterfowl, said Karen Rowe, bird conservation program leader for the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission. . Most birds in Arkansas are flying north at this time of year, Rowe added. She plans to travel to the farm next week to look for clues about how the virus could have spread. . “Was it carried in on clothing or boots? There’s just a lot of unanswered questions,” Rowe said. . Butterball LLC, which has contracts to buy turkeys from farms in Arkansas and Missouri that were infected, declined to speculate about how the virus was spread. . Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] contracts for turkeys from an infected farm near Fortuna, Missouri, and said the origin of that infection is under investigation. . “We know that AI is spread by migratory wild waterfowl,” spokesman Michael Martin said, referring to the virus. “However, we are not taking anything for granted.”    |Fri Mar 13 20:48:38 +0000 2015||U.S. bird experts mystified by Midwest avian flu spread |5.764850386714419e+17|http://reut.rs/1BeVQDe
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - A simple vision test using a stopwatch and a few flashcards may help parents and coaches screen young athletes for concussions, a small study suggests. . “In the youth leagues in particular, when there may not be doctors or athletic trainers on the sidelines when a kid gets hit, this enables parents with proper training to participate in the preliminary assessment of concussions,” said study author Dr. Steven Galetta, a researcher at New York University Langone Concussion Center. “It’s so affordable and easy to administer that any coach or parent could use it to determine when an injured child can return to the game and when they need to sit out.” . Many injured athletes currently get a standard concussion assessment. These evaluations test coordination, using exercises like jumping jacks, and memory and cognitive function by asking athletes to memorize and recall short lists of words and quizzing them about simple facts like the date or the name of the president. . The current study focuses on an exam, the King-Devick test, that requires speed reading numbers on a card from left to right as quickly as possible. Numbers are arranged in pattens that are harder to read after a concussion, making the answers slower and less accurate after an injury. . At the start of the study, researchers tested 243 youth league hockey and lacrosse players, ranging in age from 5 to 17, and 89 college athletes, to see how quickly and accurately they could read the numbers on the cards. . Later in the season, the researchers repeated the eye exams on 12 of those players who had concussions. Screened on the sidelines, these athletes’ average time on the test was 5.2 seconds slower than the average time before the concussion. . But among 14 athletes who repeated the test after a game, but who hadn’t been injured, the average time on the test was 6.4 seconds faster than before, the researchers reported in the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology. . “A lay person can see if a kid gets hit, and then it’s standard for them to remain out for that game, but this test gives you a way to measure the injuries you might not see and decide what to do when the kid says they’re good to go back in the game and you don’t know what really happened,” said Dr. Laura Balcer, another author on the study and co-director of the concussion center at NYU.  . The NYU researchers did a separate study looking at how concussions impact sight and found that visual performance tests can improve detection and management of concussions. Approximately half of the brain’s circuits are related to vision and many of these pathways can be damaged by a concussion, the researchers found.  . One advantage of the rapid vision test used in the study is that it’s easy to administer with relatively little training, said Dr. Robert Dimeff, director of primary care sports medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.  . The hardest thing to control for in this test is the kids, he said. “You worry with a test like this that there will be some athletes who might go deliberately slower at baseline if they know it will be used against them to be pulled out of a game later,” said Dimeff, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . “This vision test is one piece of the puzzle, not the only piece,” Dimeff said. “For the 11-year-old youth league where you don’t have any health professionals on the sidelines, it can help.” .

Laura Zuckerman|SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - Idaho lawmakers have passed a bill banning indoor tanning for children under 13 and requiring parental consent for those aged 14 to 18 to address the state’s rising skin cancer rate.  . The bill, which must still be signed or vetoed by the governor, passed the Idaho legislature this week after emotional testimony from skin cancer survivors and pleas by groups such as the American Medical Association to address the nation’s growing incidence of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. . The legislation is similar to laws in place in states such as Delaware and New Hampshire, said Karmen Hanson, program manager for the National Conference of State Legislatures.  . But she said it is not as restrictive as bans in California and 10 other states, where anyone under 18 is prohibited from using ultraviolet tanning devices. Forty-one states regulate the use of tanning facilities by children or teens, she said. . In 2012 and 2013, Idaho lawmakers rejected more restrictive teen tanning bans after appeals by the indoor tanning industry for the state to adhere to its tradition of limiting government. . But leaders of the Republican-controlled legislature who sponsored this year’s legislation pointed to a call last year by the U.S. Acting Surgeon General to reduce sun-bed usage to help prevent skin cancer, and an announcement in May by the federal Food and Drug Administration that it was reclassifying tanning beds as moderate risk devices, from low risk. . State Representative John Rusche, the Lewiston Democrat who had twice pushed for broad bans on indoor tanning by teens, said on Friday that the measure sent to Governor C. L. “Butch” Otter, who has not said if he will sign it, is a step in the right direction. . “It certainly will lower the UV exposure among pre-teens and early teens and reinforce for parents that they really shouldn’t be having kids exposed to cancer-causing radiation,” said Rusche, a pediatrician. . But John Overstreet, head of the Indoor Tanning Association, said opponents of indoor tanning are overstating the link between the devices and skin cancer. . “There is no science that supports moderate exposure to ultraviolet light, inside or outside, as a dangerous risk,” he said. . Melanoma rates have been rising for the past three decades, according to the American Cancer Society, and it is the most common form of cancer for Americans aged 15 to 29. |Fri Mar 13 20:30:37 +0000 2015||Idaho lawmakers approve limits on indoor tanning by teens |5.764805045323284e+17|http://reut.rs/1BeS0de
James Harding Giahyue|MONROVIA/DAKAR (Reuters) - Seven months after Ebola paralysed Liberia’s capital, Friday marked 21 days since the country registered a case of the virus - offering lessons to its neighbors on the importance of surveillance and education in beating the deadly epidemic.     . At the peak of Liberia’s outbreak, the world watched in alarm as patients died on the pavement outside hospitals in the capital Monrovia while the government failed to build treatment centers and recruit staff fast enough. . With hundreds of new Ebola cases each week, overstretched officials worked hard to respond to the unprecedented epidemic. . By January the country was just days away from declaring its ocean-front capital free from the virus. . Then officials discovered an itinerant charcoal trader had brought it back to the sprawling suburbs. . A series of mistakes in the immediate aftermath of her arrival in St. Paul’s Bridge, mostly by frightened patients, led to more than 100 contacts dispersed across three counties. Health officials intervened quickly to address them, preventing another major flare-up of the epidemic. . It required “a combination of detective work and an almost military element,” said Dr. Philippe Maughan, senior operations administrator at the humanitarian branch of the European Commission. “Getting from 100 to ten cases is much easier than getting from ten to zero.” . Liberia has accounted for more than 4,000 of the 10,000 dead from Ebola across West Africa. It will not officially be declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) until it goes 42 days without a case. . But the 21-day period is important because it spans the incubation period of the virus. And last week the country released its last known patient, a resident of Monrovia’s riverside St. Paul’s Bridge community where the virus once spread quickly among narrow streets. . A massive influx of international aid, including crucial U.S. military assistance, helped Liberia to turn the tide of the outbreak. . But, notes Tariq Riebl, Oxfam’s Ebola response manager in Liberia, “What got us to the endgame is that communities took things into their own hands.”  . Liberian health reports reviewed by Reuters show the behavior of some residents of St. Paul’s Bridge was partly behind the explosion in contacts. . Among the most notorious incidents was a policewoman,  referred to only as “VZ” in official reports, who helped her son skip quarantine. In another incident, an Ebola-positive man evaded officials and remained at large until he was stabbed in a robbery in Monrovia’s Red Light District, leaving a trail of police officers and gangsters at risk of contamination. . “They did not trust anyone and did not believe they were carriers of Ebola,” said Reverend John Sumo, head of social mobilization in the Ebola response, adding the problem was exacerbated by a leadership struggle in the local community that distracted officials from providing support to families and food to those quarantined, the reports showed. . When alarming reports began to circulate, government and international health officials quickly provided faster and closer surveillance, as well as prioritizing the education of locals about the disease. . They worked with police officials, village chiefs, elders and international aid workers to get people talking to each other, and also appointed a local “contact tracer” - responsible for tracking down people close to the latest cases - for blocks of the St Paul’s Bridge community. . Thanks to this success, Liberia’s last eight cases all came from established contacts, the aid officials said. . Oxfam’s Riebl noted that in recent months the rising number of Ebola patients referring themselves as authorities had more success in engaging communities.  . By contrast, although the epidemic is waning in neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, contact tracing there remains weak. Last week, only 14 percent of new cases in Guinea came from established contacts and resistance to healthcare workers is commonplace.  . However, even if Liberia is declared Ebola-free, imported cases are possible from the region’s poorly-policed borders where communities that have not so far been exposed to the disease still have misconceptions about it. . The World Health Organization also warns that only 40 percent of non-Ebola health facilities in the capital have an effective system of “triage” – the process by which highly-contagious Ebola patients are safely identified.  . “It is important to invest in preparedness for a possible reappearance,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa.  |Fri Mar 13 19:00:48 +0000 2015||Watch closely and explain frequently: Liberia's Ebola lessons |5.764579038104699e+17|http://reut.rs/1DgaS2r
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Many transgender men face discrimination in U.S. healthcare settings, according to a new study. . About 42 percent of female-to-male transgender adults reported verbal harassment, physical assault or denial of equal treatment in a doctor’s office or hospital, the researchers report. . “Over a third of participants in the study were blatantly mistreated when they tried to get healthcare,” said Deirdre Shires of Wayne State University in Detroit. . She and co-author Kim Jaffee write in the journal Health and Social Work that past research found transgender people often face discrimination or harassment in various areas of life, including healthcare. . The little research that does exists tends to focus on male-to-female transgender people, they write. For this study, they focused instead on female-to-male people.     . Their data came from a 2008-2009 survey of 1,711 female-to-male transgender people from the U.S. and its territories. Most were ages 25 to 44. . Over three quarters lived full-time as their nonbirth gender. A similar proportion reported some type of medical gender transition. . Asked about experiences in doctors’ offices or hospitals, 28 percent said they’d been denied equal treatment, about 32 percent reported verbal harassment, and about 1 percent reported physical assaults. . Shires emphasized that it’s not clear who discriminated against the participants. Additionally, she said, the results may not apply to the entire transgender community. . One researcher not involved with the study told Reuters Health by email that she wasn’t surprised by the findings. . If anything, the study may underestimate the problem, “because the sample was skewed towards young, white, college-educated people with jobs and private health insurance,” said Dr. Laura Erickson-Schroth, a psychiatrist at New York University in New York City. . “If 42 percent of that group is reporting discrimination, the number may be even higher for others,” said Erickson-Schroth, who is the editor of the book Trans Bodies, Trans Selves. . A next step, Shires said, would be to find ways to improve healthcare experiences for transgender people. . For example, she said, it’s still difficult for many transgender people to identify themselves on medical forms as anything other than male or female. . “At every point in the healthcare system if you’re transgender there is no place for you,” she said. “There is no way to identify yourself and it’s a vicious cycle.” . Erickson-Schroth pointed out that 65 survey participants said they never accessed care at a doctor’s office or hospital. . “Though this is a small number, I can’t help but wonder if they avoided care completely because they feared harassment or discrimination,” she said. . While the medical community is beginning to make changes to improve care for transgender people, Erickson-Schroth said progress is slow.  . “The most important step the medical community needs to take toward ending discrimination against transgender people in clinical settings is educating providers,” she said. . Previous research found that medical schools only spend an average of five hours on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. Some schools never discuss the topic at all. . The education of healthcare providers should start in school, said Erickson-Schroth, but shouldn’t end there. . “It should happen in hospitals and clinics as well,” she said. . The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBT Equality have searchable databases of providers with an interest or expertise in working with transgender people, Erickson-Schroth said. . Also, she pointed out, people can often report discrimination to clinics and hospitals, or they can contact organizations such as the National Center for Transgender Equality or the Transgender Law Center. .

Jonathan Kaminsky|NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - The spread of a deadly bacteria from a secure laboratory to a colony of monkeys at a Louisiana primate research facility may have been caused by lapses in the use of protective clothing by those in the lab, federal investigators said on Friday. . The Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria was discovered late last year after two monkeys treated at the breeding colony’s veterinary clinic became ill. It has led to three monkeys being euthanized.  . A worker at the clinic and five other monkeys have tested positive for possible exposure to the bacteria but have not grown sick. . Investigators probing the cause of the outbreak at the Tulane National Primate Research Center, outside of New Orleans, did not identify a specific event that triggered it, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. . But the improper use of protective outer clothing by those in the lab could have allowed the bacteria to cling to inner garments and escape the lab that way, the CDC said. . Investigators also found that center staff often entered the lab without wearing the protective clothing at all, which also could have led to the bacteria’s spread. . Research on the bacteria at the facility, being conducted to find a vaccine, has been halted, and will remain so until Tulane officials can show that staff has been properly trained and a plan is in place in the event of a future outbreak, the CDC said. . There is no indication that the bacteria, which is not native to North America and is usually contracted by exposure of an open wound to contaminated soil or water, has made it into the surrounding environment, and the risk to the general population is low, the CDC has said. . The clinic, which has been decontaminated, is believed to be where the monkeys came into contact with the bacteria while being treated for routine illnesses and injuries, the CDC said. . The bacterium can cause a disease called melioidosis in both humans and animals. It has a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other diseases like tuberculosis or pneumonia, according to the CDC.        |Fri Mar 13 17:15:24 +0000 2015||Safety lapses possible in deadly bacteria outbreak in Louisiana monkeys |5.764313776436142e+17|http://reut.rs/1Bedbw5
Wendell Roelf|CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African doctors have successfully performed the world’s first penis transplant on a 21-year-old man whose organ had been amputated three years ago after a botched circumcision. . The nine-hour operation, which took place in December, was part of a pilot study by Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town and the University of Stellenbosch to help the 250 or so young South African men who lose their penises each year after coming-of-age rituals go wrong. . Doctors said the patient, who was not named, had already recovered full urinary and reproductive functions, and that the procedure could eventually be offered to men who have lost their penis to cancer or as a last resort for severe erectile dysfunction. . “Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery,” Andre van der Merwe, the head of the university’s urology unit who led the operation, said in a statement. . Another nine patients have now been lined up to have the operation. . Each year thousands of young South African men, mainly from the Xhosa tribe, mark their passage into manhood by shaving their heads and smearing themselves with white clay from head to toe, living in special huts away from the community for several weeks, and then undergoing ritual circumcision. . But in May 2013, more than 20 youths died after initiation rituals in the northerly Mpumalanga province, prompting rare cross-party calls for reform of a traditional practice. . A few months later, police made several arrests on suspicion of murder after 30 young men died in coming-of-age rituals in rural Eastern Cape. Unlawful circumcisions have been known to injure up to 300 young men across the province in the space of a week. . The South African government has promoted medical circumcisions over the less safe traditional practices. Last year, the Department of Health said it was studying a non-surgical, disposable circumcision device that it believed could also provide a safer alternative. . The Israeli device, PrePex, has been endorsed by the World Health Organization. It has been piloted at several non-profit sites across South Africa but has not yet been introduced in government hospitals. |Fri Mar 13 16:48:19 +0000 2015||South African doctors perform world's first penis transplant |5.764245607042253e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dfy7dd
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Older adults who suffer a fall are twice as likely to have a common type of irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, according to a new study. . “These results are certainly surprising, as an association between AF and falls has not been shown in the general population before,” said Dr. Sofie Jansen of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. . Certain arrhythmias are known to cause fainting or blackouts, but this is the first study to show the link with falls, Jansen told Reuters Health by email. . She and her colleagues analyzed data on 4,800 adults over age 50 in Ireland who completed questionnaires, personal interviews and physical health assessments, including electrocardiograms, between 2009 and 2011. . Twenty percent of participants reported falling at least once in the past year. Fainting and blackouts were less common. . Overall, three percent of people had atrial fibrillation (AF): about one percent of those ages 50 to 64, four percent of those up to age 74, and almost eight percent of those ages 75 and older. More than a third did not know they had AF before the study. . Almost 30 percent of those with AF had fallen over the past year compared to about 20 percent of those without AF, the researchers reported in Age and Ageing.  . After accounting for other risk factors that might contribute to falls, the authors found that having AF doubled people’s odds of falling.  . In addition, 10 percent of people with AF reported fainting or blacking out compared to four percent of those without the arrhythmia. . At least five million U.S. adults in 2010 had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which may rise to about 12 million cases by the year 2030, according to a 2013 study (see Reuters Health article of July 26, 2013 here: . ).  . The irregular, usually very fast, heartbeat can cause uncomfortable palpitations, limit the ability to exercise or lead to heart failure or stroke, but it may not cause symptoms for some. It can be treated with medications and lifestyle changes to reduce stroke risk, according to the National Institutes of Health. . There are several ways AF could cause a fall, Jansen said. . “AF can impair the ability of the heart to pump blood around the body, including the brain,” she said. “This can lead to a reduction in the amount of oxygen going to the brain, causing either a faint or black-out (syncope), or dizziness resulting in a fall in a person who is already unstable.” . The irregular heartbeat can also be tied to stroke and hypertension, which can lead to degenerative changes in the brain. . “All of these changes in the brain can also affect walking, mobility, and other conditions that affect fall risk, such as depression and dementia,” Jansen said. . But, she emphasized, this study did not show that AF causes falls, only that it is significantly more common among people who fall. . “Falls are very common in older adults,” Jansen said. “People with AF have an even greater risk of falls, and when they suffer from falls they should definitely mention this to their physician, as there are several treatment or prevention options for falls.”  . “Because falls usually have several causes or contributing factors, recognition and treatment of all of these factors is vital to reduce fall risk,” she said.  . The most common causes of falls are muscle weakness, balance problems, gait problems, medication side effects, neurological issues, dizziness or cognitive impairment, according to Dr. Laurence Z. Rubenstein, who chairs the Donald W. Reynolds Department of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City. . Cardiac arrhythmias, including AF, do cause some falls but less commonly than the other causes and risk factors mentioned, said Rubenstein, who was not part of the new study. . “Falls are a very important problem in the older population and we’re always looking for ways to reduce them,” he said. “When you do a post-fall evaluation, listening to the heart is an important part of that,” and a doctor would likely discover signs of AF it were present, he said.  .

Susan Heavey|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while in Sierra Leone was in serious condition at a Maryland hospital, and a second American who may have been exposed to that patient was being flown back to the United States, U.S. health officials said on Friday.  . The National Institutes of Health said the U.S. Ebola patient was flown into the United States earlier on Friday and admitted to the NIH’s high-security containment facility in Maryland. The patient is the 11th person with the deadly virus treated in the United States. . The NIH said the patient was in serious condition. The NIH did not release any more details. . The aid group Partners In Health said in a statement that the clinician was working for them in Sierra Leone, and noted their colleague “remains in good spirits.” . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said another American volunteering in Sierra Leone had “potential exposure” to that patient and was being transported to the Atlanta area to be near Emory University Hospital, which has treated other Ebola patients. . The developments followed a relatively quiet period for Ebola in the United States, a reminder that while the spread of the virus has eased somewhat in West Africa, it still remains dangerous.  . The CDC said that as a result of the latest case it is working to trace the contacts of volunteers combating Ebola in Sierra Leone, including several other Americans, who may have been exposed to the healthcare worker now at the NIH. . The CDC said none of these other people, including the one headed to Atlanta, has tested positive. . However, the CDC said it was working with the State Department to develop plans to return those Americans with potential exposure to the United State, where they will isolate themselves and be under direct CDC monitoring 21 days. . A British healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while in Sierra Leone was flown back this week to Britain, along with four others who are being monitored for possible infection.   . CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the agency’s team in Sierra Leone is still gathering information but said there is no evidence so far that the U.S. and British cases are related. . While the virus has killed about 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, only a handful of cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain.     |Fri Mar 13 13:42:27 +0000 2015||American healthcare worker with Ebola arrives at NIH for treatment:  http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_-0i19WMAAPVkf.jpg|5.763777880825774e+17|http://reut.rs/1xk0lvP

|SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China had more than 18,500 drugs waiting for approval at the end of 2014, up by a third from a year before, the official Center for Drug Evaluation said on Friday, reflecting industry concern that it is getting harder to get medicines approved in the China market. . Drug company executives say China has toughened the approval process, with companies forced to go through six to eight-year wait times in the world’s second biggest pharmaceutical market, where spending is set to hit as much as $185 billion by 2018, according to IMS Health. . China’s fast-growing healthcare market is a magnet for drugmakers, medical device firms and hospital operators, with a broader healthcare bill set to hit $1 trillion by 2020. However, the sector is riddled with issues from rampant bribery to huge divides between urban and rural care. . China’s drug trial center received 8,868 drug applications in 2014, up from 7,610 the year before, according to the annual report Center for Drug Evaluation, overseen by the country’s food and drug regulator, and released on Friday. . The organization said it had increased the number of reviews it completed last year, but it was outflanked by an increase in new drugs to review.  . “This has further increased the backlog of pending tasks,” it  said. . China’s healthcare sector has been en vogue of late with investors and dealmakers. Deals in the sector doubled to $18.5 billion last year, Thomson Reuters data showed, with the speed of growth accelerating even further at the start of this year. |Fri Mar 13 09:12:45 +0000 2015||China drug approval backlog jumped by a third last year |5.7630991594756096e+17|http://reut.rs/1BcriSB
Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has disputed U.S. scientists’ findings that the deadly swine flu virus has acquired more virulent mutations in the South Asian country and rejected their concerns over how authorities are monitoring an outbreak of the disease. . H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu, has killed more than 1,500 people in India this year, compared with 218 in 2014. India says the strain is the same as the one that killed an estimated 284,000 people in the global pandemic of 2009-10.  . Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said in an article on Wednesday that the genetic information of two Indian strains, deposited in public databases in the past two years, revealed new mutations that could make the virus more deadly. . But India’s National Institute of Virology said in a statement late on Thursday that the findings were “incorrect”. . “We found that the strain analyzed in the said publication and the sequence data of the original H1N1 virus ... did not show any of these mutations,” the institute said.     . The government agency also said the strain analyzed by the U.S. scientists had no relevance to the current outbreak. . The MIT researchers called for greater surveillance to determine whether the mutations were currently present in India. . “There is a real need for aggressive surveillance to ensure that the anxiety and hysteria are brought down,” said Ram Sasisekharan, one of the research paper’s authors.  . “When you do real-time surveillance, get organized ... then you can come up with a better strategy to respond to the virus.” . In recent weeks, India has placed orders to increase the stock of diagnostic kits and procured additional doses of anti-viral drug Oseltamivir. Officials are investigating the cause of the steep rise in deaths. . Indian health ministry officials were not immediately available to comment on the MIT article. . Some other experts have also contested its findings. . “There should be increased surveillance for influenza in India but at the same time we should not draw conclusions based on the sequence analysis of two strains,” said Manish Kakkar of the Public Health Foundation of India. |Fri Mar 13 07:51:49 +0000 2015||India, U.S. researchers clash over swine flu strain mutation |5.762895481346744e+17|http://reut.rs/1BcaoU7
|PORTLAND, Ore./SEATTLE (Reuters) - Lawmakers in U.S. Northwest states said on Thursday they would revive efforts to make it harder for parents to legally opt out of vaccinations for their children, after legislative proposals in the wake of a measles outbreak stalled this week. . All U.S. states require certain vaccines for students for diseases such as mumps, rubella, tetanus or polio, but school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for medical reasons, including an inhibited immune system.  . Almost all states grant religious exemptions against immunizations, while 20 states allow philosophical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . A proposal in Oregon that would have removed philosophical and religious exemptions from school vaccinations, but preserve medical exemptions, was withdrawn on Wednesday after a backlash from parents and groups against vaccinations. Only Mississippi and West Virginia have such laws in place. . “As with all matters of personal choice, we have to be certain that our choices don’t impinge on our neighbors’ health and well-being,” Oregon state Senator and physician Elizabeth Hayward, a Democrat, said in a statement through an aide. The state has some of the country’s lowest immunization rates . Hayward’s office said she was revising the legislation, which would require parents seeking an exemption on non-medical grounds to consult a physician, but was not sure when she would introduce it. . Oregon passed a 2013 law requiring parents to obtain a doctor’s signature or watch an educational video on vaccination risks and benefits. . In Washington state, a proposal to scrap philosophical objections faced similar opposition and failed to be put to a vote, Democratic state Representative June Robinson said. . Robinson said she hoped to introduce a bill in the next legislative session. . The proposals followed a measles outbreak in the United Sates that sickened more than 150 people. Lawmakers in at least 10 states are promoting legislation that would make exemptions harder to obtain. . Last month, California lawmakers introduced a bill to end the personal beliefs exemption for vaccinations in that state. The bill is set for a hearing in the state Senate on April 8. In Vermont, a bill would remove religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccinations. . Overall, 68 percent of U.S. adults say childhood vaccinations should be required, while 30 percent say parents should be able to decide, according to Pew Research. |Fri Mar 13 02:25:15 +0000 2015||Lawmakers in Northwest eye new vaccine proposals after bill defeats |5.762073618257224e+17|http://reut.rs/1DcXP1S
|LONDON (Reuters) - A world virtually free of tobacco and its devastating health consequences could be a reality within 30 years if governments showed political will and took stronger action against cigarette companies, health experts said on Friday. . The international group of public health and policy specialists, writing in The Lancet medical journal, said sale of tobacco should be phased out worldwide by 2040 and called for a “turbo-charged” international effort against its use. . A billion people are forecast to die this century from smoking and other forms of tobacco use if control efforts are not stepped up. More than 80 percent of those deaths will be in poor and middle-income countries. . “A world where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion — yet not prohibited — is achievable in less than three decades... but only with full commitment from governments, international agencies, such as United Nations and World Health Organization, and civil society,” said Robert Beaglehole of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, one of the experts. . Describing a “tobacco-free” world as one where less than 5 percent of adults use it, he added: “The time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the... sale of tobacco products.”  . Tobacco kills some 6 million people a year worldwide, according to the WHO. And besides lung cancer, which is caused by smoking and is often fatal, smoking is also a major risk factor for a range of other illnesses. It is the world’s leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure. . The experts said that even a decade after the introduction of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), only 15 percent of people globally have adequate access to programs to help them stop smoking and fewer than one in 10 people are covered by tobacco taxes at FCTC recommended levels. . In the same period, 50 million people have died due smoking and tobacco-related diseases, they said. |Fri Mar 13 00:19:15 +0000 2015||Experts call for a tobacco-free world by 2040 |5.7617565630162534e+17|http://reut.rs/1Bazwuv
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Pakistani and Bangladeshi people in London’s least healthy boroughs are being asked to provide spit samples and health records to researchers hoping to find genetic clues to why they are disproportionately affected by certain diseases. . The East London Genes and Health project will focus partly on so-called “knock-out” genes — rare in the general population but more frequent in communities where cousins and other close relatives marry and have children, as is more common in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. . The largest community genetics study in the world will recruit 100,000 volunteers from East London, which have substantial South Asian populations.  . Researchers leading the study say health signals buried in the data could have a big impact on peoples’ health worldwide. . “This is the first time a large-scale genetics study has focused on two distinct ethnic minority groups, with high levels of health concerns in the community and the potential for significant genetic variation,” Richard Trembath, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, told reporters at a briefing.      . “These findings will play a key role in tackling health inequality locally and in the UK, (and) we hope to reveal crucial information about the link between genetics and common diseases which will have significant international impact.” . Studying genetic variation is crucial to improving understanding of the “normal” variation in genes in certain populations, which can then help the diagnosis of inherited rare diseases. . So-called “knock-out genes” occur when a healthy person has two copies — inherited from both parents — of a gene that functions differently to the norm. . The team hopes to use these findings to understand how knock-out genes impact health and eventually to help develop new drugs or treatments which block bad genes and enhance good ones.  . East London districts — and their Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in particular — are among Britain’s least healthy. Life expectancy is lower, rates of heart disease and diabetes are higher and infectious diseases like tuberculosis are far more prevalent than in other more affluent areas. . “Not only do South Asian people have some of the highest rates of poor health in the UK, they are also markedly under-represented in medical research,” said David van Heel, the study’s co-leader.  . “We aim to change this by gathering a unique dataset which will then be harnessed ... locally, nationally and internationally.” . The team will look specifically at heart disease and diabetes and also examine why people of certain ethnicities suffer poor responses to some medicines. |Fri Mar 13 00:19:15 +0000 2015||Genetics study seeks South Asian health clues in East London |5.7617565437651354e+17|http://reut.rs/1DcwIEa
Jonathan Kaminsky|NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - A Louisiana primate research facility worker may have been exposed to a deadly bacterium stored at an on-site laboratory that earlier sickened three monkeys, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. . The Burkholderia pseudomallei bacterium is stored at a high-security laboratory at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans, about half a mile from where thousands of monkeys are kept in a breeding colony housing a veterinary clinic, and federal investigators have been seeking to figure out how it migrated from one place to the other.  . Research on the bacterium, being conducted to find a vaccine, has been halted, Tulane has said. . Tests showed that the worker, employed at the clinic where the infected monkeys had been treated, had an amount of antibodies just at the threshold for a verified positive result. More tests will be needed to determine whether the worker was exposed to the bacterium, the CDC said.  . There is no indication that the bacterium, which is not easily spread by humans or monkeys but usually contracted by exposure of an open wound to contaminated soil or water, has made it into the surrounding environment, and the risk to the general population is low, said Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman.    . Eight monkeys at the facility have been found to have been accidentally infected with or exposed to the bacterium since late last year. . Three were euthanized. The others, including one the CDC announced Thursday as having been exposed, have shown antibodies indicating exposure but have displayed no symptoms.  . The clinic, which has been decontaminated, is believed to be where the monkeys came into contact with the bacterium while being treated for routine illnesses and injuries, the CDC said. . A federal investigator who visited the facility in January tested positive for exposure to the bacterium, but was found to have been exposed to it earlier, likely while traveling in a region where it is endemic, which include parts of Southeast Asia and Australia. . The clinic worker who tested positive was among the workers and monkeys who have been tested in the wake of the breach, the CDC said. . The bacterium can cause a disease called melioidosis in both humans and animals. It has a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other diseases like tuberculosis or pneumonia, according to the CDC. .

|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kansas on Thursday said it was prohibiting the movement of poultry into or out of two counties in a bid to protect its livestock from bird flu found in neighboring Missouri. . The quarantines in Cherokee and Crawford countries, which are on the Missouri border, will last until further notice and at least 30 days, according to a statement from the Kansas Department of Agriculture. . Earlier on Thursday, Mexico, the biggest importer of U.S. chicken, and other buyers imposed new import restrictions following confirmation on Wednesday of a virulent form of bird flu in Arkansas, in the heart of America’s poultry producing region. . The U.S. government on Tuesday confirmed the presence of the virus in two separate commercial turkey flocks in Missouri. |Thu Mar 12 22:58:17 +0000 2015||Kansas quarantines two counties due to Missouri bird flu |5.761552801337672e+17|http://reut.rs/1BaltVO
|(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s pain drug, Lyrica, failed a post-marketing study testing the treatment in adolescents with fibromyalgia, a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. . Pfizer conducted the trial to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements after Lyrica was approved for the condition. . Lyrica, known chemically as pregabalin, is currently approved for various indications in 139 countries and regions. . The drug is also approved in the United States for neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord injuries, post-herpetic neuralgia, and partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy who are already taking other drugs. |Thu Mar 12 21:41:48 +0000 2015||Pfizer pain drug Lyrica fails study in adolescents with fibromyalgia |5.7613603275371315e+17|http://reut.rs/1DbVUe2
|(Reuters) - The U.S. National Institutes of Health will admit to its hospital on Friday a U.S. healthcare worker who tested positive for the Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone.  . The NIH said the patient will be transported in isolation by chartered aircraft to its high-security containment facility on its Maryland campus. . Earlier on Thursday, a British military healthcare worker infected with the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone was flown to London for treatment, and health officials said four more workers were being assessed for possible infection. . The unidentified American will be admitted and treated at the NIH Clinical Center’s Special Clinical Studies Unit. The patient will be the second confirmed Ebola patient to be treated at the facility, which also took care of Texas nurse Nina Pham, who became infected with Ebola while treating a patient at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. . In addition to the two confirmed patients, NIH has also cared for two individuals who experienced high-risk exposures to Ebola while working in West Africa, but who were subsequently found not to be infected. . The NIH said it is not releasing any more details about the patient at this time.  . Ebola has now killed nearly 10,000 people in the three worst-affected countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. . Rates of new infections have come down quickly in recent months, however. Liberia last week released its last known Ebola patient from hospital, but Sierra Leone still had 127 patients in Ebola treatment centers as of March 10. |Thu Mar 12 21:41:48 +0000 2015||NIH says to admit U.S. healthcare worker infected with Ebola |5.761360309627699e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ba65IS
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - For young people out on the town, having more friends come along in the group is tied to downing more drinks per hour, according to a new study. . That’s not entirely surprising, but this is the first time researchers have used smartphone-based assessments over the course of the evening to understand the drinking behavior of young adults in real life situations, said lead author Johannes Thrul of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. . For the new study, 183 young adults from universities in the French-speaking region of Switzerland were contacted by email and filled out Internet questionnaires. . For the next five weeks, on Thursdays, Friday and Saturdays, they were sent six text messages between 8 p.m. and 11 a.m. the following day. The texts included a link for the students to complete questionnaires on their smartphones, including questions about how many drinks they had and how many friends were present. . The authors excluded people who did not drink at all or who failed to fill out their questionnaires. . Men and women seemed to stick with relatively small groups of friends on Thursdays, and drinks per hour declined from 8 p.m. to midnight. . They tended to have the most friends around between 10 and 11 p.m. on Saturdays – an average of more than six friends for men and more than five for women. . As the number of friends increased, so did drinks per hour, according to the results published in the journal Addiction.  . Men peaked at an average of 2.5 drinks per hour between 11 PM and midnight on Saturdays, and women had 1.9 drinks per hour during the same period. . “The conclusions we can draw from our study is that friends and drinking are related,” Thrul told Reuters Health by email. “To really show that friends cause more drinking we would need a different study design, for example randomly assigning different numbers of friends to individual participants and assessing their resulting drinking behavior.” . It is still too soon to say exactly what the mechanism might be connecting larger groups and higher drinking volume, Thrul said. . It is possible that drinking reports became less accurate as the evening progressed and participants became more inebriated, he noted. . In The Netherlands, and likely also in Switzerland, people tend to report their drinking fairly honestly, according to Ninette van Hasselt, head of the Youth and Risky Behavior department at Trimbos Institute in Utrecht, The Netherlands. . “Nevertheless, self reports on drinking are only an indication of people’s alcohol use, as people’s recollection of the exact amount of drinks consumed during a long night out is not very accurate,” van Hasselt told Reuters Health by email.  . This was also a rather small study of mostly well-educated people, but it does apply to realistic nightlife drinking situations, which is important, she said. . Social processes involved in nightlife seem to encourage more drinking, she said. . “I think the most likely explanation is that social status has a bigger impact in larger groups, causing more risk behavior such as drinking - as this type of behavior can contribute to one’s status,” said van Hasselt, who was not involved in the study. . “Another explanation is that the strength of the norm to drink increases with the size of the group. People are often not aware of these social processes and influences,” she said.  . Risky behavior is more important for men than women for gaining social status, she said. . “People tend to think that their alcohol consumption is a result of their own intentions,” van Hasselt said. “But situational factors have a much bigger impact than people realize.” . “For people who want to limit their alcohol intake, this means that if you want to drink less, you should avoid nightlife settings,” she said. .

Linda Thrasybule|(Reuters Health) - Getting on the scale every day may boost enthusiasm for healthy behaviors and lead to greater weight loss, according to a new U.S. study. . Obese and overweight people who weighed themselves daily lost more weight than those who weighed-in less often, likely because the daily weighers made better food and exercise choices, researchers say.  . “It might be that daily weighing triggers an understanding of what people were eating and how it was affecting their weight,” said lead author Dori Steinberg, a nutritionist and researcher with the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “So they’re more likely to reduce portions, eat enough vegetables or use a pedometer.” . Past research suggests that self-monitoring, such as tracking steps or food intake, helps people adjust their behavior to stay in line with their goals, Steinberg’s team wrote February 12 online in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  . Some studies have also indicated that dieters who weigh themselves daily fare better than those who weigh-in less often, although it’s not clear why, the authors write. . “Since keeping track of your diet can be hard, we discouraged participants from tracking diet in this study,” said Steinberg. “Instead we asked them to focus on just weighing daily to monitor progress as a way of determining whether their diet and exercise habits were working.” . The researchers recruited 91 people between 18 and 60 years old with no major medical conditions, weights in the overweight to obese range and internet access. About half were randomly assigned to the intervention group, and the other half were assigned to go through the intervention later. . At the start of the study and again six months later, all participants filled out questionnaires about their diets, exercise and other health-related behaviors. Both groups were given “e-scales” with wireless internet connections, which delivered data to a website that displayed progress over time. People in the intervention group were also instructed to weigh themselves every day. . During the study, the intervention group participants received weekly email messages that included weight loss tips and strategies, while the comparison group received nothing. . At six months, researchers found that daily weighers lost 13 to 14 pounds (about 6 kilograms) while those who weighed themselves five days or fewer each week lost about 7 lbs (about 3 kg).  . The daily weighers also adopted more weight-control behaviors, such as reducing between-meal snacks and cutting the number of meals eaten out at restaurants, increasing exercise and reducing television-watching time. Daily weighers adopted an average of 17 positive behaviors versus seven adopted by those who weighed themselves less often. . “Since everyone in this group was supposed to weigh themselves daily, it’s possible that those that did were just more motivated in general,” said Dr. Kristine Madsen, a specialist in pediatric obesity at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.   . “So we don’t know that daily weighing actually caused any of the healthier behaviors,” said Madsen, who was not involved in the study. . The authors also acknowledge that the study was small and doesn’t prove daily weighing caused behavior changes that led to weight loss. And since they did not randomly assign people to weigh themselves daily or less frequently, they don’t know if daily weighing is a reflection of greater engagement in weight loss efforts rather than a cause of it. . Madsen does think that daily weighing is a good way to monitor your progress. . Steinberg said it’s a useful tool, like writing down what you eat every day. “Weighing daily is easier and people are more likely to stick with it over time,” she noted.  . SOURCE: .   .

|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two out of three people in the United States with cancer that has spread to nearby tissue live at least five years after they are diagnosed, according to a federal study released on Thursday. . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked patients diagnosed from 2003 to 2010 and found that the overall five-year survival rate for invasive cancer was 65 percent. A goal of a federal program called Healthy People 2020 is to reach a rate of 71.7 percent. . Five-year survival rates were highest for patients aged 45 and younger at 81 percent and for those with prostate cancer, 97 percent, or female breast cancer, 88 percent. Invasive lung cancer, which often spreads to the brain or bones, had the lowest rate at 18 percent. . “Four decades ago, survival was about half at five years,” Lisa Richardson, who directs the CDC’s division of cancer prevention and control, told Reuters. “Over the years, the trends have been up, and I believe we’re going to continue to see those trends.”  . She credited improved diagnostic tools and treatment for the improved survival rates. . Although therapies for some cancers have improved over the years, cancer epidemiologists warn that early diagnosis can produce a misleading view of survival rates. Even if tumors are detected when they are small, patients might not live to an older age than they would have if detection had happened later; they just live more years knowing they have cancer and are more likely to be counted as five-year survivors. . Richardson urged patients diagnosed with invasive cancer to work with their doctors to get appropriate treatment and  screenings and to adopt healthy habits. “If they smoke, quit; maintain a healthy weight and exercise,” she said. . Survival rates varied by race. Among black patients with invasive cancer, 60 percent survived at least five years, while 65 percent of white patients did. . The disparity, Richardson said, could be because black Americans have higher rates of chronic illnesses, such as type-2 diabetes, as well as less access to quality health care. |Thu Mar 12 19:57:59 +0000 2015||Two-thirds in U.S. with invasive cancer live five or more years: study |5.7610990370359706e+17|http://reut.rs/1B9EDes
|(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have accepted Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s re-submitted marketing application for an experimental hepatitis C treatment after the drugmaker was forced last year to withdraw its initial request. . Bristol-Myers on Thursday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will review daclatasvir, its so-called NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc’s potent and widely used Sovaldi treatment. It said the FDA is expected to make its decision within six months. . Bristol-Myers originally had sought FDA permission to market daclatasvir in combination with another Bristol drug, asunaprevir. But it abandoned that application due to potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. .  Bristol-Myers then went back to the drawing board, collecting data from a separate large trial in which daclatasvir was tested with Sovaldi in patients with a different and less-common strain of hepatitis C, called genotype 3.  . In that late-stage trial, 90 percent of previously untreated patients had no trace of the virus after 12 weeks of treatment. . Daclatasvir is already approved in Europe, Brazil and Japan as part of a combination therapy. |Thu Mar 12 19:57:58 +0000 2015||FDA to review re-submitted Bristol-Myers hepatitis C drug |5.7610990180777165e+17|http://reut.rs/1DbuzZg
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Measles cases could almost double in countries hardest hit by the West African Ebola outbreak as overwhelmed health systems are unable to maintain child immunizations, scientists said on Thursday. . For every extra month that health care systems are disrupted, international researchers said up to 20,000 children aged between nine months and five years were put at risk. . “It could be a long time before the health care systems in the region recover from this,” said Justin Lessler, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who co-led the study into the ripple effects of the Ebola epidemic. . “While the downstream effects of Ebola are many, we can actually do something about measles relatively cheaply and easily, saving many lives by restarting derailed vaccination campaigns,” he told reporters in a telephone briefing. . West Africa’s Ebola epidemic — the largest ever seen — has infected more than 24,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing almost 10,000 of them.   . Outbreaks of measles — one of the most transmissible diseases — often follow humanitarian crises as vaccination campaigns falter and populations are displaced and impoverished. . While Lessler’s team only looked in this study at measles risk, he said the Ebola epidemic had also disrupted delivery of vaccines against polio and tuberculosis and of a combined shot that protects against meningitis, pneumonia, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B and diphtheria.  . The number of children not getting these vaccines in the region may be 600,000 to 700,000, he said, adding that health services for people with malaria, HIV and TB were also severely disrupted. . “The secondary effects of Ebola — both in childhood infections and other health outcomes — are potentially as devastating in terms of loss of life as the disease itself,” Lessler said. . For the measles study, the researchers modeled the consequences of various degrees of disruption to health services. . Before the Ebola outbreak, they estimated that about 778,000 children between nine months and five years had not had measles vaccines — about 4 percent of the population of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . Assuming a 75 percent reduction in health care, the level closest to reality at the time, for 18 months, they projected that the number of unvaccinated children could rise 45 percent to 1,129,000, or by around 20,000 a month. . After 18 months of reduced healthcare, the study projected that a large measles outbreak would infect about 227,000 people instead of 127,000 — the vast majority young children. Lessler said this could mean 2,000 to 16,000 extra deaths. |Thu Mar 12 19:33:18 +0000 2015||Measles cases seen almost doubling in Ebola epidemic countries |5.7610369366328115e+17|http://reut.rs/1B9woyX
|NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Thursday announced strict new recommendations for preventing the transmission of infections from reusable medical devices such at those that have spread “superbug” infections at several hospitals. . A key change is that when manufacturers submit instructions for disinfecting the devices between uses, the Food and Drug Administration will not take the company’s word that the instructions work, but will demand proof. . The FDA action followed reports last month that hundreds of patients may have been exposed to pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant “superbugs,” after flexible tubes called duodenoscopes were not properly disinfected between patients. Two patients at the University of California-Los Angeles died. . The new recommendations apply, however, not only to duodenoscopes but to most medical devices intended for repeated use, including bronchoscopes and endoscopes. . To deal with the thousands of devices already in use, whose disinfection protocols were not subjected to rigorous validation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released instructions for reducing the risk of transmitting infections. . As previously reported by Reuters, the protocol calls for swabbing the device after it has supposedly been disinfected and seeing if any microbes grow into detectable colonies, much as doctors take throat swabs to determine if a patient has a strep infection, before the device is used again. . The duodenoscopes at the center of the recent superbug outbreaks are made by Olympus Corp, Fujifilm Holdings Corp, and Pentax. . The recommendations are based on draft proposals the FDA released for public comment in 2011 but never put into practice. . As far back as 2009, the FDA believed that transmission of infection by duodenoscopes occurred when hospitals did not properly follow manufacturers’ instructions for “reprocessing,” or disinfecting, the devices between use. Only recently, the agency said, did it conclude that such transmission can occur even when the instructions are followed to the letter, an indication of how difficult it is to clean the complex equipment. . As part of its review before approving a reusable device, the FDA evaluates reprocessing instructions. In the past, the agency essentially took manufacturers at their word when they claimed a procedure worked; now they will have to submit data proving so “with a high degree of assurance,” the agency said. . The FDA does not, however, “have the authority to require manufacturers to change their (device’s) design” even if it prevents disinfection, Dr. William Maisel, FDA’s deputy center director for science, told reporters. |Thu Mar 12 18:52:47 +0000 2015||U.S. regulators tighten requirements on reusable medical devices |5.760934967104225e+17|http://reut.rs/1DbbRkt
|BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nearly half of food products in Europe contain residues of pesticides, with strawberries the most likely to exceed legal limits, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said on Thursday. . The official EU body also found traces of pesticides in organic foods, though it said its analysis of almost 81,000 food samples found the risk of any negative impact on health was low. . But campaign groups said the data was worrying, especially in the cases where residues of more than one pesticide were found. They said the pesticides were mostly fungicides, which are possible carcinogens, and more research was needed into the implications of exposure to more than one. . The latest EFSA report, for 2013, found that almost 55 percent of the samples of food products in European Union and neighboring countries were free from detectable traces of chemicals.  . Of the rest, only 1.5 percent clearly exceeded legal limits, meaning that businesses responsible for them face action. . The highest rate of exceeding limits was for strawberries (2.5 percent of the sample). They are especially sensitive to disease and so undergo considerable spraying with pesticides.   . EFSA said it had tested for 685 pesticides in the 27 nations that belonged to the EU for all of 2013 (Croatia joined in that year), plus Norway and Iceland, and had found multiple residues in 27.3 percent of samples. . “For short-term exposure, the risk of European citizens being exposed to harmful levels of residues via their diet was rated as low,” the EFSA said in a statement. . “Exceeding the legal limit does not necessarily imply exceeding the safety limit,” it said.     . The Pesticide Action Network (PAN) advocacy group was sceptical, calculating that one out of every eight boxes of strawberries contained six pesticide residues. . “In general the pollution of European food with pesticide residues remains at a very, unhealthy high level and there is no real improvement visible in recent years,” Martin Dermine of PAN Europe said. . For organic food, 15.5 percent of samples contained pesticides within legal limits and mostly of kinds permitted for organic farming, but 0.8 percent exceeded permitted levels. |Thu Mar 12 18:46:01 +0000 2015||Strawberries top list of pesticide-laced food: EU report |5.76091794154369e+17|http://reut.rs/1B9kyow

Anne Harding|NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Pregnant women exposed to chemical weapons during the August 2013 attack in Syria were much more likely to miscarry or deliver prematurely, new findings show. . The study also found a high rate of serious birth defects among babies whose mothers had been exposed to poison gas. “This is a starting point, and I hope that it opens the door for way more research and study,” Dr. Sawsan Jabri, one of the study’s authors, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.  . On August 21, 2013, the Syrian government launched a chemical attack against rebel strongholds outside Damascus, which killed more than 1,600, according to Dr. Jabri, who is a candidate for a master’s degree in public health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.  . While the chemical used in the attack has not been identified, Dr. Jabri said, sarin is the most likely candidate.  . Dr. Jabri and Dr. Omar Hakeem of Al Ghouta Hospital in Damascus wrote online February 23 in The Lancet Global Health, “While the acute exposure resulted in several deaths, the long-term consequences are still unfolding.”  . The two researchers reviewed medical records for 211 pregnant women who visited Al Ghouta Hospital in the fall of 2014, including 110 who said they’d been exposed to the chemical attack.  . Forty-five percent of exposed women miscarried, compared to 14 percent of the unexposed women.  . The rate of stillbirths among the exposed group was 27.2 per 1,000 births, Dr. Jabri and Dr. Hakeem note, compared to a rate of 12.4 per 1,000 for Syria in 2009. . Globally, about three of every hundred babies has a congenital abnormality or birth defect, the authors note. Among the 110 exposed women, seven had newborns with serious malformations, and five of the infants died within a few days. One of the two surviving infants had cardiac abnormalities while the other had cerebral edema. . “Clinical findings among the babies who died included multiple malformations of the head and spinal cord, absence of the occipital and parietal bones of the skull, small brain size with a large amount of fluid between the skull and scalp, dissecting skin in many areas of the body, and many clots in the umbilical cord,” the authors write. . Dr. Jabri and Dr. Hakeem hope to collect data on birth outcomes from other hospitals serving areas affected by the chemical attack. One issue that needs to be studied, she added, is how much of the chemical remains in the environment and in the groundwater, which could affect generations to come. “It’s very, very hard to tell,” she said. .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Male smokers have a greater risk for osteoporosis than other men and even than women smokers, a recent study finds, suggesting that U.S. screening guidelines focused on women might need to be expanded to include men. . “We expected the risk would be worse for women, but it was actually worse for men,” said senior study author Dr. Elizabeth Regan, a researcher at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. “The data also show that if men do have osteoporosis and get hip fractures, they do worse than the women.” . Osteoporosis makes bones so weak and brittle that a fall – or even a sudden coughing fit or deep bend – can cause a fracture. It becomes more common with age. About one in 10 women over the age of 50 has the condition, compared with one in 50 men, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  . Women tend to have smaller, thinner bones than men, and they lose bone density when their production of the hormone estrogen decreases after menopause. Smoking can accelerate the loss of bone density. . Regan and colleagues examined bone density and the severity of lung disease, and looked for small fractures in the vertebra of the spine in 3,321 current and former smokers as well as a group of 63 people who never smoked. . The researchers found that male smokers had a small, but significantly greater risk of low bone density, and more vertebral fractures, than female smokers. Such signs of osteoporosis were present in 58 percent of study participants, and in 84 percent of people with a severe form of the smoking-related lung disorder known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). . Thirty-seven percent of the study participants had one or more vertebral fractures, and they were mostly male, older than the group average, more likely to be current smokers and had smoked for a longer time. . Study participants weren’t randomly selected, the study team notes in Annals of the American Thoracic Society. They add that it’s possible they chose a group of smokers with unusual degrees of bone loss. . Still, based on the results, Regan recommends that both male and female smokers be screened for osteoporosis. “Smokers already get screened for lung cancer and they could in theory use the same CT scan image to look at bone density,” she said. . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a government-backed independent organization that reviews medical evidence, last updated screening guidelines for osteoporosis in 2011. The task force concluded that women 65 and older as well as women with other risk factors would benefit from screening. These guidelines are widely used to determine whether insurance will pay for screening, and widely followed by primary care physicians. . “The evidence in 2011 was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening men for osteoporosis because there were few relevant treatment studies in men,” said Dr. Albert Siu, a co-vice chair of the task force and a professor of geriatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. . The current study does help quantify the osteoporosis risk in men who smoke, but it doesn’t address the lack of evidence showing what preventive treatments might work in men, said Siu, who wasn’t involved in the study. The USPSTF strives to revisit recommendations every five years, he said.  . There haven’t been large studies proving that medications such as bisphosphonates, a family of drugs commonly prescribed for osteoporosis, are as effective in men as in women, agreed Dr. Eric Orwoll, a professor of medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University. But he also criticized the task force for failing to recommend osteoporosis screening for men. . “Nobody is going to pay for those studies in men because the drugs are already approved and the science points to them being equally effective in men and women, with the same markers of bone metabolism and the same effects on fractures,” said Orwoll, who wasn’t involved in the study.   . Men and women can take some of the same steps to reduce the risk of broken bones, Orwoll said. Regular exercise and strength training can keep bones stronger, as can a healthy diet with limited alcohol consumption. “And smokers, of course, should quit,” he said. . SOURCE: .

Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 or 25 years old would significantly reduce their use and tobacco-related illnesses in the United States, a study published Thursday found, suggesting that states and local authorities  should consider passing such laws.  . If the minimum age was raised to 19 years old, smoking prevalence would decrease 3 percent by 2100. It would decrease by 12 and 16 percent in the same period if the legal age was raised to 21 or 25 years old, according to the study conducted by the influential Institute of Medicine and a panel of experts.  . U.S. smoking rates have dropped sharply from 42 percent of the population in 1964 to 18 percent today. Along with many other measures aimed at curbing smoking during that period,   states have established minimum legal ages, mostly at 18 years old. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which sponsored the report, cannot increase the minimum age to buy tobacco in the country from 18, but states and local authorities can do so.   . Four states - Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah - have increased the minimum age to buy cigarettes to 19 years old. New York City and some cities in Massachusetts have increased it to 21 years old.   . The report was presented to the FDA on Tuesday, said Richard Bonnie, chair of the report committee. “We hope that the localities and the states will pay attention to the report as they make their judgments about what to do,” he said in an interview.  . Many parts of the brain do not fully develop until age 25, including the parts most responsible for impulse control, decision making and peer susceptibility and conformity, according to the study. That makes adolescent brains highly vulnerable to nicotine use and addiction, researchers said.  . Among people who smoked daily, 90 percent had tried their first cigarette before the age of 19 while the remaining 10 percent had tried tobacco products by 26, the study found. That data suggests that if someone has not smoked a cigarette by 25 years old, they are unlikely ever to do so, said Bonnie.  . Raising the minimum age to buy tobacco products would reduce not only smoking rates, but many tobacco-related illnesses. For example, researchers estimate that if the legal age was raised to 21, there would be 249,000 fewer premature deaths for people born between 2000 and 2019, 45,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost. |Thu Mar 12 16:14:15 +0000 2015||Raise minimum age to buy cigarettes to decrease use: U.S. study |5.760536004697784e+17|http://reut.rs/1DaxdhW
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Thinking skills, social interactions and quality of life may improve for older people with hearing loss when hearing is restored with a cochlear implant, according to a study from France. . One year after getting an implant, participants between the ages of 65 and 85 were able to hear words more clearly. Also, most had improved cognitive abilities and fewer of them reported symptoms of depression. . “We know older adults, when they don’t hear well, withdraw and begin to get depressed,” said Dr. Colin Driscoll, chair of otorhinolaryngology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. . Driscoll, who was not involved in the new study, said other research also shows that the lives of older people tend to improve after receiving hearing aids. “I think we’ve known that in a way for quite some time,” he said. . For the new study, researchers with the French national public-assistance hospital network at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris examined data on 94 patients between 2006 and 2009. The participants were examined before they received a cochlear implant and then six and 12 months afterward. . Cochlear implants – unlike hearing aids – do not just amplify sound. The implants bypass portions of a damaged ear to send sounds directly to the auditory nerve, which in turn sends signals straight to the brain. Also unlike hearing aids, cochlear implants require minor surgery to install. . After one year, the participants were better able to understand words in both loud and quiet settings, said Dr. Isabelle Mosnier and her coauthors, writing in JAMA Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery.  . The participants’ quality of life scores improved, too. . “The biggest advantage of cochlear implants is that it can restore clarity,” Driscoll said. “Many patients not only have a problem with volume, but also clarity.” . Of the 37 participants with abnormal cognition scores at the start, 30 had improved cognition after having the implant for one year.  . Among all the participants, 59 percent showed no signs of depression before implantation. Ayear afterward, 76 percent had no signs of depression.  . The researchers note that their results are limited to what happens after one year. Other studies show that people who receive cochlear implants continue to use the devices for years, however. . Driscoll said cochlear implants are covered by most insurance plans, but people often have to meet a certain level of hearing loss before they’re eligible. That bar is especially high for Medicare, the U.S. insurance for the elderly and disabled, he added. . While hearing aids range in price from low-cost versions to several thousand dollars, Driscoll said cochlear implants can cost up to $20,000 for just the device. “When you outgrow conventional hearing aids, that’s when you’re a cochlear implant (candidate),” he said. “Many patients who are using hearing aids now will do better with a cochlear implant.” .

Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 or 25 years old would significantly reduce their use and tobacco-related illnesses in the United States, a study published Thursday found, suggesting that states and local authorities  should consider passing such laws.  . If the minimum age was raised to 19 years old, smoking prevalence would decrease 3 percent by 2100. It would decrease by 12 and 16 percent in the same period if the legal age was raised to 21 or 25 years old, according to the study conducted by the influential Institute of Medicine and a panel of experts.  . U.S. smoking rates have dropped sharply from 42 percent of the population in 1964 to 18 percent today. Along with many other measures aimed at curbing smoking during that period,   states have established minimum legal ages, mostly at 18 years old. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which sponsored the report, cannot increase the minimum age to buy tobacco in the country from 18, but states and local authorities can do so.   . Four states - Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah - have increased the minimum age to buy cigarettes to 19 years old. New York City and some cities in Massachusetts have increased it to 21 years old.   . The report was presented to the FDA on Tuesday, said Richard Bonnie, chair of the report committee. “We hope that the localities and the states will pay attention to the report as they make their judgments about what to do,” he said in an interview.  . Many parts of the brain do not fully develop until age 25, including the parts most responsible for impulse control, decision making and peer susceptibility and conformity, according to the study. That makes adolescent brains highly vulnerable to nicotine use and addiction, researchers said.  . Among people who smoked daily, 90 percent had tried their first cigarette before the age of 19 while the remaining 10 percent had tried tobacco products by 26, the study found. That data suggests that if someone has not smoked a cigarette by 25 years old, they are unlikely ever to do so, said Bonnie.  .

Misha Hussain|DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - West Africa may lose up to $15 billion over the next three years due to the impact of the Ebola outbreak on trade, investment and tourism, according to a report by the United Nations. . The world’s deadliest Ebola epidemic has killed almost 10,000 people in the three most affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, deepening poverty in one of the least developed parts of the world. . “The consequences of Ebola are vast,” said Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, Africa director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  . “Stigma and risk aversion have caused considerable amounts of damage, shutting down borders and indirectly affecting the economies of a large number of countries in the sub-region.” . In the best-case scenario, the report said the mineral-rich region may lose on average $3.6 billion per year for the next three years before the economies start to recover.  . The worst-case scenario predicts losses of up to $4.9 billion per year over three years, with the bulk of the impact felt by the three worst affected countries, said the report released on Thursday by the United Nations Development Group, a consortium of U.N. agencies. . Women, rural communities and the poor who make a living in informal trade are likely to be hit the hardest, said Ayodele Odusola, chief economist for UNDP Africa. . “If you look at Guinea, almost 85 percent of the potato trade with Sierra Leone is done by women, but because of the border closure, this activity was completely paralyzed,” Odusola told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from New York. . “In Liberia (the impact of Ebola) crudely translates to families not being able to put any food on the table for a minimum of 15 days every year for the next three years,” said Odusola, who supervised the report. . The poverty rate - the proportion of people living below the poverty line of $1.25 a day - could increase by up to 22 percent in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in 2016, the report said. . Even countries that have reported few or zero Ebola cases, such as Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Mali, have been hit by the crisis. In Ivory Coast, the poverty rate could rise by 2.7 percent in 2016. . Beyond the worst affected countries, estimates of the economic impact of Ebola have varied wildly. In January, the World Bank estimated the impact on African economies at $500 million, just a fraction of the more than $25 billion in losses first expected. . Odusola said making accurate economic models in a region so dependent on informal, undocumented trade is difficult. . “If you go to any West African border town you can see that the crossings are buzzing with economic activity, but it’s very hard to measure how much,” said Odusola. “This is a conservative estimate from official figures.” . The three countries have set a 60-day target to eliminate Ebola by mid-April, but only Liberia has managed to report zero Ebola cases over the last week. |Thu Mar 12 15:41:31 +0000 2015||Ebola could cost West Africa $15 billion over three years |5.760453615229911e+17|http://reut.rs/1B8HSCJ
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said an advisory panel will discuss the transmission of “superbug” infections through certain procedures in U.S. hospitals. . A second top Los Angeles hospital reported an outbreak of drug-resistant “superbug” infections last week, and dozens more potential exposures, from procedures performed with a fiber-optic instrument called duodenoscope. . The gastroenterology and urology devices panel would meet on May 14-15, FDA said on Thursday. (. ) . A top FDA official said earlier this month that manufacturers’ tests of procedures to clean medical scopes linked with “superbug” outbreaks contained flaws that render their cleaning instructions unreliable. . Duodenoscopes have been associated with episodic infections for more than a decade. But an increasing number of germs have developed a resistance to antibiotics, making them potentially more dangerous and difficult to treat. . The regulator issued an updated safety alert for duodenoscopes last week, urging medical providers to inform patients of the risks associated with the use of such instruments.  . Olympus Corp, Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Pentax Medical are among makers of the devices. |Thu Mar 12 14:42:47 +0000 2015||FDA says panel to discuss 'superbug' spread |5.7603058073278054e+17|http://reut.rs/1B8wgzK
|AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government said on Thursday that 30,000 chickens had been destroyed after bird flu was identified at a free-range farm near the eastern town of Barneveld. . In a statement, the government said it was still determining the strain of the virus in question, but that it was likely a mild form and not the highly pathogenic strain that struck Dutch farms last year. . Hundreds of thousands of birds were destroyed in response to last year’s outbreak, which experts estimated cost the Dutch poultry industry at least 100 million euros. . “Since a low pathogenic H7 (influenza) variant can mutate into a highly pathogenic variant, the affected farm was cleared as quickly as possible” in accordance with European rules, the government said. . The Netherlands is one of the world’s largest agricultural producers and its second largest agricultural exporter, selling  79 billion euros worth of goods abroad last year. . With so many farms packed in a small area, disease can spread quickly. . The government imposed a three-week poultry transport ban in a 1 kilometer (O.6 mile) radius of the affected farm, an area that contains 17 other poultry farms. |Thu Mar 12 14:42:46 +0000 2015||Chickens destroyed after bird flu found at Dutch farm |5.7603057886213325e+17|http://reut.rs/1B8weYz
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer is seeking new vaccine opportunities across the age spectrum as it broadens its portfolio by delivering shots into the arms of adolescents and the elderly, as well as infants. . Previously reliant on just one vaccine, the blockbuster Prevnar, the U.S. drugmaker is now expanding its product line-up through both in-house development and by shopping for assets in a consolidating sector. . In December it closed a deal to buy Baxter International’s portfolio of marketed vaccines in a $635 million deal that will help it reach a broader population. . Susan Silbermann, head of Pfizer Vaccines, said she was open to more such acquisitions, although there were fewer assets for sale in vaccines than in pharmaceuticals, where a race for promising new drugs has triggered a deal-making frenzy. . “We are an important growth engine for the company and there are lots of ways to grow. We will continue to grow with our current portfolio — much of which is new anyway — but if we have external opportunities that would be great,” she said in an interview during a visit to London. . “Having a broad portfolio helps us in terms of our positioning and presenting in front of healthcare professionals and governments.” . For many years the vaccines industry has been dominated by five big companies, but that has shrunk to four with GlaxoSmithKline’s purchase of Novartis’ business. The other large players are Sanofi and Merck. . Prevnar, which protects against pneumococcal bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other infections, will remain Pfizer’s cornerstone vaccine for the foreseeable future, with both a new 13-strain version of the shot and an older seven-strain one generating sales of $4.5 billion in 2014. That made it the group’s second-biggest franchise. . Pfizer is diversifying, however, by developing a pipeline of new vaccines, even as it extends the use of Prevnar 13 into the over-65s in a move expected to boost sales. . A recently approved vaccine for meningitis B together with other vaccines in development point to growth possibilities. . The new meningitis B vaccine will go head-to-head with Bexsero, a rival developed by Novartis and taken on by GSK.  . Pfizer also has high hopes for a second wave of vaccines beyond this, including experimental shots against Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile, two potentially life-threatening infections often caught in hospital. . Aside from infectious diseases, there is an intriguing anti-smoking vaccine designed to block the uptake of nicotine by the brain in early-stage clinical testing and another against allergic asthma. Both highlight a push into non-traditional adult markets. |Thu Mar 12 14:42:46 +0000 2015||Pfizer hunts for new vaccines to protect young and old |5.7603057700818125e+17|http://reut.rs/1Da7Z37

|LONDON (Reuters) - A British military healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone is being flown back to Britain along with four others who do not have the disease but need precautionary monitoring, health officials said on Thursday. . The unnamed healthcare worker who has Ebola was transported in a specially equipped medical plane and will be treated in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London, the country’s designated Ebola treatment center. . Two of the four close contacts who have not tested positive for the disease will be monitored at the Royal Free, while the other two will be flown back to Newcastle, northern England, and monitored at the city’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.  . The healthcare worker who has tested positive was exposed to the virus in a frontline care facility for Ebola patients. . Britain, the former colonial ruler of Sierra Leone, has between 600 and 700 military personnel deployed in the West African country to help combat the epidemic. . Ebola has now killed more than 10,000 people in the three worst-affected countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. . Rates of new infections have come down swiftly in recent months, however. Liberia last week released its last known Ebola patient from hospital, but Sierra Leone still had 127 patients in Ebola treatment centers as of March 10. |Thu Mar 12 11:11:05 +0000 2015||UK health worker with Ebola flying back, 4 others being assessed |5.75977306998571e+17|http://reut.rs/1B7QppF
|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Arkansas, the third-largest U.S. turkey producer and home to Tyson Foods Inc, the nation’s biggest chicken company. . Shares of Tyson and other poultry companies, including Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc, tumbled on concerns the discovery will further limit U.S. trade with Asia and Latin America.  . Tyson’s stock price fell 5.6 percent to $37.55 after hitting a five-month low of $37.35.  . The infected flock of 40,020 turkeys in Boone County, Arkansas, is located within the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along which the same strain of H5N2 bird flu was previously identified in Minnesota and Missouri. . Arkansas officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, according to USDA. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.  . In response to the news, Japan’s farm ministry halted imports of live poultry and poultry meat from Arkansas from Thursday, a ministry official said. It has already imposed bans on imports from nine other states, including Minnesota, Missouri and Kansas this month, its website showed. . Other countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua have also restricted poultry exports from U.S. states that have suffered bird flu outbreaks, including California and Oregon. . A spokesman for the Philippines’ Department of Agriculture said its ban would probably be extended to Arkansas once it had received formal notification of the outbreak there. |Thu Mar 12 09:05:04 +0000 2015||Highly pathogenic bird flu confirmed in Arkansas turkeys: USDA |5.759455931571937e+17|http://reut.rs/1D91jCo
Naomi Tajitsu|WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand has received no indications that any foreign countries would stop buying its dairy products following a threat to poison infant formula with a toxic pesticide, the agriculture ministry said on Thursday. . Countries including China, the biggest buyer of New Zealand dairy products, were not closing the door on shipments, a top official from the ministry told Reuters, as police track down the sender of letters to dairy giant Fonterra and the national farmers’ group which were accompanied by infant formula laced with the pesticide 1080. . “Last night we had been speaking to our counterparts in overseas markets, and as of this morning, none of them indicated that any product was going to be stopped,” said Scott Gallacher, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Primary Industries. . Following the announcement of the police investigation earlier this week, China has said it would increase scrutiny of milk powder imports from New Zealand, the world’s largest dairy exporter, which depends on the commodity for around a quarter of its export earnings. . While China has stopped short of placing restrictions on imports, some smaller New Zealand infant formula marketing companies said they had seen a fall in orders for the product commonly prized among China’s growing middle class since the threat was publicized.  . A few domestic milk powder and infant formula processors said they had not seen a fall in demand for their products so far, while adding that ramped-up Chinese scrutiny may delay exports by around two to four weeks. . “The feedback from the market has been very quiet. We’ve only had one direct contact from one customer in China who has requested that we test for 1080 and make sure the results are on (shipping certificates),” said Richard Wyeth, CEO of Miraka, which processes milk powder and UHT milk products. . But he added: “We only make commodity powder, so we’re not seeing the full impact that others would be.”  . Infant formula processors have said they anticipate stable demand from overseas buyers, while Fonterra which processes nearly 90 percent of the country’s milk collection, will not comment on offshore demand for its products. . MPI’s Gallacher said dairy processors were informed of the investigation last month, the same time that overseas government agencies and big infant formula brands including Nestle, Abbott Laboratories and Mead Johnson were told. . Larger companies were informed before smaller ones, which were told by their suppliers after the threat was publicized, as dairy processors and the government believed the impact to their supply chains warranted an early heads up, he added. |Thu Mar 12 06:59:03 +0000 2015||No bans on New Zealand dairy products after poison threat: government |5.7591388086770074e+17|http://reut.rs/1B7aBrR
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Mexico, the biggest buyer of U.S. chicken, and other major countries imposed new import restrictions on Thursday after a virulent form of bird flu was found at the heart of America’s poultry region.     . The virus’ discovery in Arkansas is expected to prompt similar moves by up to 40 more countries, and the restrictions are likely to depress prices and hurt U.S. poultry producers, economists said. . Top U.S. poultry producers like JBS SA unit Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc downplayed the risk to operations, but the Arkansas case sent their shares tumbling on Wednesday ahead of an official confirmation.     . “We will see some markets shutting their imports, mainly . from that state, but not from the whole country,” said Wesley . Batista, chief executive officer of meats company JBS SA  . Fearing the virus’ spread, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, along with other importers, on Thursday  banned poultry imports from  Arkansas. Missouri, Minnesota, California, Washington state and Oregon already face bans or restrictions.  . China and South Korea have total bans on U.S. poultry exports from prior avian flu cases.  . After recent cases in a handful of other states, the U.S. government on Wednesday confirmed the infection of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu in turkeys in Arkansas, home to Tyson Foods Inc, the world’s biggest chicken company. The virus is unlikely to kill enough U.S. birds to offset the drop in overseas demand due to trade bans. . While the H5N2 strain poses no threat to humans, according to the USDA, it is deadly to poultry. Avian flu can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 24 hours. . The USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, an industry group, said it expected 30 to 40 additional countries to impose new trade restrictions on U.S. poultry and eggs in the $5.7 billion export market.  . There will be “more product on the domestic market and that will depress prices,” said Jessica Sampson, agricultural economist at Livestock Marketing Information Center. . The United States exports about 20 percent of the chicken it produces and about 14 percent of the turkey produced, according to the center. . Last year, China and South Korea accounted for about $428.5 million in export sales of poultry meat and products, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  . With the export market already hit by the strong dollar, “we don’t need anything else that would make those exports any softer,” said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms. . Shares in Sanderson, Tyson and Pilgrim’s Pride were flat to lower on Thursday.     . So far, viral strains of bird flu have been identified mostly in wild birds and commercial turkey farms, predominantly west of the Rocky Mountains. But the industry has been on alert since Minnesota and Missouri confirmed cases in the past week. . Minnesota is the nation’s leading turkey producer, while Arkansas ranks third and Missouri is fifth, according to the USDA. The poultry sector fears the virus could spread through the much bigger domestic chicken industry. Arkansas is the third-largest chicken producer. . Poultry companies have been enjoying large profits recently thanks to high meat prices and declining feed costs. In January, Tyson reported operating income of $351 million for its chicken business in the quarter ended Dec. 27, up almost 40 percent on the year. . Trade restrictions could drive down prices by 5 percent to 10 percent in the United States for dark meat, which makes up the majority of chicken exports, said H.L. Goodwin, a poultry economist at the University of Arkansas. . How poultry companies will handle such pricing woes is not yet known. At North Carolina-based Butterball LLC, a “limited number” of turkeys from farms in Missouri and Arkansas that supply birds to the company have been diagnosed with H5N2 bird flu, according to a statement. . The company, which accounts for 20 percent of all U.S. turkey production, declined to comment on its pricing. . Tyson also declined to discuss the impact bird flu may have on the company but said no flocks grown for Tyson have been diagnosed with the virus. . Tyson “has the ability to ship products from multiple states, so we believe we can meet demand for both domestic and global markets,” company spokesman Worth Sparkman said. |Thu Mar 12 06:59:03 +0000 2015||U.S. exports at risk as bird flu enters heart of poultry country |5.7591387915649434e+17|http://reut.rs/1D8HwDl
Lisa Baertlein|LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - KFC, the world’s largest chain of fried chicken restaurants, may face pressure from consumer and environmental groups to change how its poultry are raised after McDonald’s Corp said it would switch to chicken raised without human antibiotics. . McDonald’s will phase out chicken raised with antibiotics that are important to human health over two years to allay concern that use of the drugs in meat production has exacerbated the rise of deadly “superbugs” that resist treatment, Reuters reported last week. Within days, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp told Reuters it aims to eliminate the sale of chicken and meat raised with human antibiotics. . KFC is owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc, which has no publicly stated policy on antibiotic use in the production of meat it buys. Chick-fil-A, another chicken restaurant chain that competes with KFC, says about 20 percent of the chicken it serves is raised without any antibiotics, and that its entire supply chain will be converted by 2019.  . Both McDonald’s and Yum are stepping up efforts to win back younger and wealthier diners lured away by chains such as such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Panera Bread Co, which boast antibiotic-free meats and other high-quality ingredients. Yum’s KFC restaurants in China two years ago suffered a massive sales hit following local media reports that a few poultry farmers supplying KFC fed excessive levels of antibiotics to their chickens. . “The train has left the station,” Bob Goldin, a food services company consultant at Technomic in Chicago, said of McDonald’s influence on U.S. chicken production standards.  . Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined to discuss its standards for antibiotic use in meat production. . “The chicken served in our U.S. restaurants is USDA high quality, and free of antibiotics,” the company said in an emailed response to Reuters queries.  . The antibiotic-free statement refers to a lack of residue in the meat served at its restaurants and not the practice of delivering antibiotics to chickens before they are slaughtered, said Steven Roach, food safety program director at Food Animal Concerns Trust in Chicago. . The U.S. Department of Agriculture has three classifications for poultry, A, B, and C, and doesn’t have a “high quality” designation for chicken. Poultry rated A is what’s typically found at retail, while poultry rated B or C is usually used in further-processed products where the meat is cut up, chopped, or ground, according to a USDA website. . McDonald’s told Reuters it worked with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental group Friends of the Earth, to develop its U.S. chicken guidelines. Yum and its brands have ignored requests for information regarding its antibiotic policy, said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager for Friends of the Earth’s food and technology program. . “They have so far not answered any of our emails or phone calls,” said Hamerschlag, who is working with other advocacy groups to persuade food companies to change their supplier standards to exclude animals raised with the routine use of antibiotics. By contrast, McDonald’s was “very responsive” to the groups’ requests, she said. . Other groups working with Friends of the Earth to cut antibiotics from chickens and other meats include the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. Friends of the Earth said its interest in antibiotics has to do with animal agriculture’s connection to the environment and human health. . KFC supplier Tyson Foods Inc did not comment. Other U.S. chicken producers that have supplied Yum either declined to comment or could not be reached. It’s not known who KFC’s biggest supplier is or how many chickens KFC buys a year. . In 2012, Chinese media reports about excessive antibiotic use by a few KFC chicken farmers hammered sales there. The country has more than 4,800 KFC restaurants and accounted for nearly half of Yum’s 2014 operating profit. In response, Yum dropped some 1,000 small poultry farmers from its supply chain and launched a public relations campaign to reassure diners about the quality and safety of its food.      . Yum operates separate supply chains in China and United States. While antibiotics have made for big headlines in China, the issue also has surfaced at home. . A Reuters investigation last year found that KFC supplier Koch Foods Inc from November 2011 to July 2014 had given some of its flocks antibiotics critical to fighting human infections, even though its website stated otherwise. . The Chicago-based chicken producer changed the language on its website after questions from Reuters about its use of virginiamycin, an antibiotic included in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans. At the time, Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken. . Koch did not respond to interview requests for this story. . KFC US said at the time that its “supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” It declined to comment this week. |Thu Mar 12 05:20:03 +0000 2015||KFC faces pressure after McDonald's says no antibiotics in chicken |5.758889659218043e+17|http://reut.rs/1D8tfXg
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chance of surviving any of four high-risk surgeries can vary by as much as 23 percent depending on what hospital patients use, according to an analysis released on Thursday. . The report - by the nonprofit Leapfrog Group, a patient-safety organization supported by large employers, and Castlight Health Inc, which sells software for employers to manage healthcare spending - shows that choice of hospital “can mean the difference between life and death,” said Leapfrog’s Erica Mobley. . Rating hospitals has become somewhat of a free-for-all, with competing groups using different data and definitions of quality. Only 10 percent of the 844 hospitals rated highest by one rater were equally rated by even one of the others, found a study this month in Health Affairs. . “But when it comes to major surgery, it’s hard to think of an outcome more important than whether you live or die,” said health policy professor Dr. Ashish Jha of the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the Leapfrog report. “It’s amazing there is such variability in mortality from these common surgeries, and patients should know that.”  . Leapfrog asked 1,500 hospitals for 2013 data on four risky surgeries, including number of procedures and patient deaths. It adjusted the numbers to come up with a “predicted survival” estimate for each. . For pancreatectomy (removing all or part of the pancreas, usually to treat cancer), predicted survival rates ranged from 81 percent to 100 percent. Of 487 hospitals reporting data, 203 had rates of at least 91.3 percent, which Leapfrog chose as the benchmark for quality. . For esophagectomy (removing all or part of the esophagus), expected survival ranged from 88 percent to 98 percent. Only 182 of 535 hospitals had rates of at least 91.7 percent. . For repairs of abdominal aortic aneurysm, survival ranged from 86 percent to 99 percent; 268 of 792 hospitals met the benchmark of 97.3 percent. . For replacing the heart’s aortic valve, survival ranged from 92 percent to 97 percent; only 95 of 544 hospitals hit 95.6 percent. . The study didn’t analyze which kinds of hospitals - nonprofit or for-profit, in one region or another - excelled, but in general those that performed more procedures did best. National stalwarts such as Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, aced all four surgeries, but so did Hoag Memorial in Newport Beach, California, and Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Older people at risk of dementia who follow advice on healthy eating, exercise and brain-training can slow down cognitive decline, particularly in their ability to organize and regulate thought processes, researchers said on Thursday. . In the first randomized controlled trial of its kind, the scientists found that two years of intensive guidance for people aged 60 to 77 led to some striking differences in the brain’s capabilities in so-called executive function and processing. . While previous research has shown links between cognitive decline and factors such as diet, heart health and fitness, this trial was the first using a gold-standard design of a “control” group versus a “treatment” group to show that addressing those risk factors might slow or prevent deterioration. . Cognitive decline can be a precursor to dementia, a brain wasting disease that is becoming ever more prevalent as populations age.  . Cases of Alzheimer’s, the most common form, and other types of dementia are expected to triple to around 135 million worldwide by 2050, according to the campaign group Alzheimer’s Disease International. . To see whether health guidance might slow cognitive decline, researchers from Sweden’s Karolinska Institute and from Finland’s National Institute for Health and Welfare and University of Eastern Finland recruited 1,260 60 to 77 year-olds and randomly allocated half to an intensive guidance group and half to a control group given only routine health advice. . The study was published in the Lancet medical journal. . The intensive advice consisted of regular meetings over two years with doctors other health professionals who gave comprehensive advice on eating healthily, taking exercise engaging in brain training and having regular tests to check blood pressure and other risk factors. . After two years, participants’ mental functions were scored using a standard test, the Neuropsychological Test Battery. . Overall scores in the intervention group were 25 percent higher than in the control group, and for some elements of the test, such as executive functioning and processing speed, they were dramatically higher, at 83 percent and 150 percent respectively. . Miia Kivipelto, a Karolinska institute professor who co-led the study, said it showed how “an intensive program aimed at addressing these risk factors might be able to prevent cognitive decline in elderly people who are at risk of dementia.” . The study participants will now be followed for at least seven years to see whether the diminished cognitive decline in the guidance group translates into fewer cases of dementia and Alzheimer’s.|Thu Mar 12 00:36:43 +0000 2015||Brain-training, exercise, diet keep elderly mental decline at bay |5.758176610132132e+17|http://reut.rs/1D7Ibox
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - Tumor tests, genetic risk analyses and other products or services sold online as personalized cancer medicine are often not backed by evidence, according to a new U.S. study. . Researchers say the websites touting products or advice also tend to promote the benefits of their services far more often than they note the limitations. . “I think that’s one of the challenges . . . it’s hard to know which sites are ones that are marketing tests that are really helpful, and which sites are marketing tests or services that aren’t helpful,” said Dr. Stacy W. Gray, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston who led the study. “It’s hard to know which are which.” . Gray, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said she and a coauthor had noticed that many of their patients asked questions about information they found on cancer care web sites.   . “Knowing this is a fairly common thing, we wanted to better understand the Internet marketing landscape to see what patients might encounter online,” Gray said. “Studies over the last few years have shown in other contexts, not cancer, exaggerated claims that don’t match scientific evidence, so we wanted to evaluate what kinds of things are being marketed in cancer.” . So-called personal cancer medicine on the Internet includes analysis of tumor tissues, help interpreting tumor data or advice on the best treatments for an individual’s tumor, as well as testing for cancer risk. . Gray and her colleagues note in JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute that tests for inherited risk for developing certain cancers, or those that examine cancer cells have the potential to significantly improve cancer treatment. But because most cancer tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, some of the products being advertised don’t have proven benefits. . The researchers screened 4,910 websites, using search terms like personalized cancer medicine, individualized cancer treatment or targeted cancer care on Google, Yahoo and Bing, as well as gathering sites from scientific literature and conferences. They focused on the top 55 websites that matched their criteria for the study. . Most of the websites researchers found were commercially sponsored (56 percent), while others were promoted by academic institutions (20 percent), private institutions (15 percent) and individual doctors (2 percent).   . Some of the commercial sites offered guidance about discussing their products with doctors, while a small percentage also included a directory of doctors who might provide their tests or services.   . An expert panel helped determine whether the advertised tests had enough evidence to back-up claims of helping to treat cancer. For example, if large randomized controlled trials or large analyses of such trials found the tests effective, the panel considered the information trustworthy.  . The panel found that a minority of websites (28 percent) sold tests they would endorse.   . Half of the commercial websites included test prices, which ranged from $99 to $13,000. And while 85 percent of the websites described benefits of their products, only 27 percent specified potential limitations.     . “The take home message for patients and doctors is that they need to be careful and critically evaluate what they see online,” Gray told Reuters Health. “If patients encounter things online they’re curious about, they should talk to their providers about whether those tests are helpful.” . Dr. Ben Park, an oncologist at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center in Baltimore said the study uncovered important information for patients and doctors. . “This study goes a long way into letting patients and physicians know that much of what is sold had not been truly validated,” said Park. “I think many in our business are aware of the over promise of these tests and the advertisements that accompany them.” . But Park noted that measuring the quality of the web sites was difficult because they were so different from one another.  . “It’s also difficult to impossible to track outcome data since usually there is never follow-up after testing and/or the information could violate HIPAA (federal health) regulations,” he told Reuters Health in an email. . More testing is needed to gauge the effectiveness of personalized testing for cancer, Park said. “To take discovery research into clinical practice takes years to decades of further research and validation. This is no different than how a new drug gets put through multiple levels of clinical testing, yet for some reason, many such steps have been ‘skipped’ for personalized medicine testing.” .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Women who enter menopause at a normal age won’t get much of a heart benefit from taking hormones, according to a fresh look at some past research. . There were some modest benefits among women who took hormones within the first 10 years of menopause, but they also had an increased risk of blood clots, which can cause strokes or travel to the lungs. . The results don’t mean there is no place for hormones after menopause, said Dr. Adrienne Bonham, who was not involved with the analysis. “It’s just that if you’re doing it to prevent cardiovascular disease, you shouldn’t be doing that.” . It’s also important to note that the results do not apply to women who enter menopause prematurely, for example in their 30s, said Bonham, the head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. . The fact that a woman’s estrogen and progesterone levels fall after menopause, while her heart disease risk rises, originally led to the idea that hormone replacement therapy might protect against heart risks. . In the late 1990s and early 2000s, large, rigorous studies found that hormone replacement did not protect against heart disease after menopause. In fact, one study ended early when researchers saw that estrogen plus progestin appeared to increase the risks of stroke, heart disease and breast cancer. . The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology does not recommend the use of hormones after menopause to prevent heart disease. However, women in early menopause without heart disease may consider hormones to help with menopause symptoms. . In recent years, additional evidence has suggested there may be some benefit from hormones for the heart health of women when they first enter menopause, said Dr. Henry Boardman from the University of Oxford, who led the new analysis. . To assess the question, the researchers combined results from 19 randomized trials that included 40,410 women from several countries. About half took some sort of hormone therapy and the other half took a placebo for comparison.  . The women had all gone through menopause and were followed for anywhere from seven months to a little over 10 years. . Overall, there was no evidence that taking hormones prevented heart disease or its complications in women with or without existing heart disease. If anything, it appeared to increase the risk of stroke, according to findings published by The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. . “These confirm existing national and international guidelines that hormone therapy should not be taken to prevent cardiovascular disease,” Boardman said. . To evaluate the question known as the “timing hypothesis” about a possible benefit from hormones for heart health among women when they first enter menopause, the researchers looked at data on those who took hormones in the first 10 years after menopause. . According to Boardman, the results suggested that if 1,000 women under age 60 were taking hormones over seven years, there would be six fewer deaths and eight fewer cases of heart disease, but also five more cases of blood clots, compared to similar women not taking hormones. . He said the results among these younger women should also be interpreted with caution, because the data weren’t originally intended to evaluate the “timing hypothesis.” . “I think the results raise interesting questions,” he said. “There is valid scientific hypothesis underpinning this. I hope this review leads to further research.” . Boardman said it’s important that women and their healthcare providers have the best information to determine whether hormone therapy is the right treatment. . Different groups of women have different risk factors, said Bonham, who added that most doctors – especially specialists – are knowledgeable about the risk and benefits. . SOURCE: .

Caroline Humer|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The entry of copycat biotech drugs into the U.S. market could cut prices of expensive medications by 40 percent to 50 percent, depending on the level of competition among drugmakers, a top executive at CVS Health Corp told Reuters. . CVS is one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers and, along with rival Express Scripts, has put unprecedented pressure on global pharmaceutical makers to lower prices for its clients. . The comments by CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan suggest U.S. drug benefit managers will be pressing for much steeper discounts on new biosimilar drugs than the 20 percent to 30 percent widely expected by Wall Street. . Depending on how similar treatments are, and on demand from doctors and patients, biosimilar pricing could more closely track the face-off among branded drugs, Brennan said in an interview on Wednesday. . Generic versions of traditional pharmaceuticals can usher in discounts of as much as 98 percent. Biosimilars retain a much higher margin due to their more complicated manufacturing process, which can create a new version of a biotechnology drug but not an exact copy. . “As a result of that, with these new ones coming on we are probably going to be seeing something that looks like more of a situation where there are multiple brands,” Brennan said. “In the past that didn’t give you 98 percent discounts. In the past, that would give you 40 to 50 percent discounts.”  . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved on Friday the first biosimilar drug for use in the country, a copy of Amgen Inc’s Neupogen cancer treatment that was made by Novartis. Pricing on the biosimilar has yet to be determined. . Drugmakers that are racing to develop biosimilars include Pfizer Inc and Hospira Inc. In Europe, Hospira already sells copycat versions of Neupogen and Merck & Co’s and Johnson & Johnson Inc’s arthritis drug Remicade. Other biosimilar players include Amgen, Biogen Idec, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Mylan Inc. . Biologic drugs have already been approved in Europe, but pricing varies as each country has a role in negotiating drug costs. . Earlier this year, Express Scripts and CVS pitted two novel treatments for hepatitis C against each other to wrest large price cuts from their manufacturers, Gilead Sciences Inc and AbbVie Inc.  . Brennan said they are likely to use similar tactics as more biosimilars enter the marketplace. That could mean excluding one of the drugs from their reimbursement list for most patients, requiring patients to try the less expensive treatment first or insisting they give prior approval before a patient begins the medication based on their specific medical history, he explained. . Brennan sees competitive pressure ahead for drugs that treat auto-immune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and colitis. . AbbVie’s Humira for arthritis and Remicade are billion-dollar biotech franchises that are close to facing biosimilar versions made by others.  . Express Scripts estimates that about $250 billion could be saved in the next decade if biosimilars for 11 different biological drugs are approved in the United States as expected.  . “Whenever you are engaging in greater competition, we should be able to take advantage of that to get a lower price,” Brennan said. |Wed Mar 11 21:14:04 +0000 2015||Exclusive: CVS says biotech drug copies may bring price cuts of 40-50 percent |5.7576666186685645e+17|http://reut.rs/1B5DZyE
|(Reuters) - Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc said it had delayed submitting a U.S. marketing application for its lead drug, nuplazid, and that its chief executive was retiring. . The company’s shares fell about 22 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, a day after rumors that the company was a takeover target pushed its stock to a record high. . Acadia will now seek approval for nuplazid as a treatment for psychosis associated with Parkinson’s disease in the second half of the year, as it needs more time to prepare its manufacturing operations, the company said. . The company originally intended to submit the application in the first quarter. . “The change in submission timing is not a result of any change to nuplazid’s clinical or safety profile, nor is it a result of any interaction with or request for information from the FDA,” Acadia said in a statement. . Separately, Acadia said Uli Hacksell had retired as chief executive and board member, and Chief Financial Officer Steve Davis would take over as interim CEO. . Hacksell has headed the company since September 2000. . Nuplazid is also being tested for use in Alzheimer’s disease-related psychosis and schizophrenia. .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Being physically active may offset some of the effects of brain aging on seniors’ ability to walk and control their movements, according to a new study. . At the highest level of activity, even when a specific sign of brain aging was present, it did not predict a person’s motor abilities, researchers found. . This may partly explain why older people who are more active tend to have better motor function, the authors write in the journal Neurology. . “The association between physical activity and motor function in older adults is well-established,” said lead author Debra A. Fleischman of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “What is less understood is the biological basis of that association.”  . Older people often have the small white spots known as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance images (MRI) of their brains. An increased number of these spots has been linked to movement difficulty, such as trouble walking.  . In the new study, the researchers used data from an ongoing study of aging, focusing on 167 people 60 to 96 years old without dementia. The participants had all worn activity monitors for up to 11 full days. . They also underwent MRI brain imaging and 11 motor performance tests, measuring grip strength, pinch strength, finger tapping as well as tests of lower body function. . Based on their own reports, the study participants were physically active for an average of four hours per week. . People with more white matter hyperintensities on their MRI scans tended to have poorer motor function, and those who were more active each day tended to have better motor function, but total daily activity was not related to the number of brain spots, the authors write.  . With statistical modeling, they found that as activity level increased, the number of white matter hyperintensities became less important for predicting motor function. . For participants in the 90th percentile of daily activity, who walked an extra one and a half hours each day, there was no association between hyperintensities and motor function. But for those at the 50th percentile there was an association – more hyperintensities were tied to poorer function. . “What was notable was that WMHs had no effect on motor function for the persons at the highest percentile of physical activity, whereas they did affect motor function for those at the 50th percentile and the effect was even stronger for the persons at the 10th percentile of activity,” Fleischman told Reuters Health by email. . White matter hyperintensities are common for older people and have been linked to cognitive impairment, stroke and death as well as motor function, she said. . Exercise did not seem to protect against these spots, but did appear to somehow circumvent their effect on motor function. But this study only looked at people at one point in time, so it does not indicate that one factor, like exercise, caused another factor, like better motor function, she noted.  . Still, the findings held when she and her coauthors accounted for other possible influences like weight, depressive symptoms, vascular disease, functional status and pulmonary function.   . “To determine whether physical activity is causally related to improved mobility would require a randomized study,” according to Dr. Richard Camicioli of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and Joe Verghese of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. . In an accompanying editorial, they write that it is difficult to tell from this study which aspects of daily activity might have been protective. The nature of physical activity, its complexity and frequency may all be important. . “I think that the important message, and the one that I give to my patients, is that they do not have to be marathon runners to maintain cognitive and motor function through physical activity as they age,” Fleischman said. . Just keep moving in any way that is safe that you enjoy, she said. . SOURCE: .  and .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Poor communication may lead some patients with chest pain to be admitted to the hospital even when their risk for a heart attack is low, a small study suggests. . “Ideally, you want the conversation between a physician and a patient to be as straightforward as possible, but in our study of admissions for cardiac observation, we found the risks of going home were terribly overinflated and so was the potential benefit of staying overnight in the hospital,” said lead study author Dr. David Newman.  . Newman, a researcher in emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and his colleagues surveyed 425 pairs of doctors and patients shortly after the patients were admitted to the hospital for acute coronary syndrome, an umbrella term for situations such as a heart attack or unstable angina where blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked.  . Symptoms can include chest pain, as well as nausea, dizziness and shortness of breath, as well as pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the jaw, neck, back or stomach. Risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity.  . The researchers excluded patients from the study who had a blood test or an electrocardiogram (ECG) confirming that they had acute coronary syndrome.  . Instead, they focused only on how doctors and patients communicated when lab tests did not definitively suggest that hospital admission was necessary.  . The average age of patients in the study was 58, and the group was roughly half men and half women. Slightly more than half of the patients had annual incomes of $50,000 or less. About 40 percent had no education beyond high school.  . Patients reported that their physicians spoke to them about their chances of having a heart attack in 65 percent of cases, but the doctors said they discussed this in only 46 percent of cases.  . Doctors and patients agreed about the heart attack risk only one third of the time, the study found.  . Asked about the odds of a heart attack or other acute event within the next 30 days, doctors said this was possible in five percent of cases, while patients said this eight percent of the time. The average risk for this patient population should be less than two percent, the researchers write in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.  . “Part of the problem could be a difference in risk tolerance between physicians and patients,” said Dr. Erik Hess, a researcher in emergency medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. “A low risk to physicians is you don’t want anyone going home with a myocardial infarction. If a patient learns their risk is two percent they may be willing to take that risk if it means not staying in the hospital overnight.” . Because the researchers didn’t collect outcomes data on patients, the study couldn’t confirm whether less than two percent of the participants actually had an adverse event. They also relied on physicians and patients to correctly recall conversations about the diagnosis and risks, instead of using audio or video recordings to verify what was discussed.  . Still, the findings speak to the need for a communication breakdown to be repaired, said Dr. Daniel Munoz, who teaches cardiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. . “What’s striking is that they were very careful to select patients who weren’t in the active throes of a heart attack and who didn’t have an alarming ECG, and both the physicians and the patients still overestimated the risks,” said Munoz, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . The danger of poor communication about risks, beyond the unnecessary tests and hospitalizations, is the waste of limited resources, said Newman. “People admitted for a cardiac stay can easily get a $5,000 to $10,000 workup in one night, resources that you could spend giving one person primary care for an entire year.” .

|(Reuters) - Specialty Compounding Llc reached a settlement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday, barring the company from producing and selling sterile drugs until it receives written approval from the agency. . The FDA filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in February, alleging that one of Specialty Compounding’s sterile injectable drugs had tested positive for bacterial contamination.  . As part of the deal, Specialty Compounding settled all litigation without an admission of guilt, but cannot resume producing, holding or selling sterile drugs until it receives written approval from the FDA. . The company recalled batches of sterile drugs in August 2013, after the FDA received reports of 17 patients developing bacterial infections after being given an infusion of calcium gluconate made by the company. . The FDA inspected the company’s Cedar Park facility in Texas in August and September 2013, and found unsanitary conditions and numerous other violations. . “Specialty Compounding’s manufacturing practices posed a serious risk to the public health,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Mizer of the Justice Department said.  . Specialty Compounding, co-owned by Raymond Solano, III and William Swail, makes both sterile and non-sterile drugs, and distributes its products to hospitals, surgery centers and clinics across the United States. |Wed Mar 11 19:30:48 +0000 2015||Specialty Compounding to halt production, sale of sterile drugs |5.757406752553288e+17|http://reut.rs/1B5ib64
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists believe they may have found a new weapon in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease — not in the form of a drug but in focused beams of ultrasound. . While the approach has only been tested in mice, researchers said on Wednesday it proved surprisingly good at clearing tangles of plaques linked to Alzheimer’s in the animals’ brains and improving their memory, as measured by tests such as navigating a maze. . In the past, high-energy ultrasound has been combined with injected microbubbles, which vibrate in response to sound waves, to get drugs across the so-called blood brain barrier. . But the new research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, is the first demonstration that ultrasound alone might have a beneficial effect in the memory-robbing condition. . “Our research was very exploratory and we really didn’t expect to see such a massive effect,” Juergen Goetz of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, one of study authors, told Reuters. “I’m really excited by this.” . After several weeks of treating mice that had been genetically altered to produce amyloid plaques, the scientists found the ultrasound almost completely cleared the plaques in 75 percent of the animals, without apparent damage to brain tissue. . While there is still some debate as to whether plaques are a cause or a symptom of Alzheimer’s, the experiment found that the treated mice had improved memory, as measured by three different tests, compared with untreated ones. . The technique works by stimulating microglial cells, which form part of the brain’s immune system, to engulf and absorb the plaques. . Goetz stressed that his research, which used an ultrasound machine from Philips, was at a very early stage and it would be several years before it could be tested in people. . Several hurdles must be overcome first, including long-term checks for side effects in animals and much more research into whether the approach will work with thicker skulls and larger brains. . The next step is to treat sheep, with data from that experiment expected later this year. . Ultrasound devices capable of penetrating the human brain are already being tested for other conditions, with Israeli company InSightec pioneering it for tremors and chronic pain. . Dementia, of which Alzheimer’s is the most common form, affects close to 50 million people worldwide and that number is set to reach 135 million by 2050, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International, a non-profit campaign group. |Wed Mar 11 18:47:51 +0000 2015||Can ultrasound fight Alzheimer's?

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - A wave of H7N9 bird flu in China that has spread into people may have the potential to emerge as a pandemic strain in humans, scientists said on Wednesday. . The H7N9 virus, one of several strains of bird flu known to be able to infect humans, has persisted, diversified and spread in chickens across China, the researchers said, fuelling a resurgence of infections in people and posing a wider threat. . “The expansion of genetic diversity and geographical spread indicates that, unless effective control measures are in place, H7N9 could be expected to persist and spread beyond the region,” they said in a study published in the journal Nature. . The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in humans in March 2013 and has since then infected at least 571 people in China, Taipei, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Canada, killing 212 of them, according to February data from the World Health Organization (WHO). . After an initial flare up of human cases at the start of 2013, the H7N9 appeared to die down — aided in large part by Chinese authorities deciding to close live poultry markets and issue health warnings about direct contact with chickens. . But infections in people increased again last year and in early 2015, prompting researchers to try to understand more about how the virus re-emerged, how it might develop, and how it might threaten public health.  . In this study, an international team of scientists led by Yi Guan of Hong Kong university monitored the evolution and spread of H7N9 over 15 cities across five provinces in China. . By collecting and sequencing a large number of samples, they found that the H7N9 virus is mutating frequently, acquiring genetic changes that might increase its pandemic potential. . A large number of new genetic variants of the virus have become established in chickens and have spread across the country, probably because of poultry trade movement, they said. . Flu experts not directly involved in the research said its findings were interesting but did not necessarily show the H7N9 was changing in ways that made it more likely to develop into a pandemic flu strain. . “What we don’t know from this paper is the significance of all these mutations that are accumulating as the virus persists and spreads,” said Wendy Barclay, an expert in flu virology at Britain’s Imperial College London. “This is especially relevant for human health — does any of this change the pandemic potential of the virus?” . In its latest update on the flu strain, the Geneva-based WHO said it “continues to closely monitor the H7N9 situation” and conduct risk assessments. . “So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has not changed,” it said. . Yi Guan’s team, however, said their analysis pointed to a need for heightened vigilance of H7N9 and for curbing direct human contact with live poultry at markets. . “Permanent closure of live poultry markets, central slaughtering and preventing inter-regional poultry transportation during disease outbreaks are needed to reduce the threat of H7N9 to public health,” they wrote. |Wed Mar 11 18:47:45 +0000 2015||Mutating H7N9 bird flu may pose pandemic threat, scientists warn |5.757298406173532e+17|http://reut.rs/1B59AjT
Tom Miles|GENEVA (Reuters) - Waning interest in Ebola could jeopardize efforts to stamp out the world’s worst recorded outbreak of the disease, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . Case numbers have fallen to a low level and it should be possible to stop transmission by mid-year, but the disease is “not waning” and it is much too early to assume the outbreak will end, said WHO Assistant Director General Bruce Aylward. . “We talk often about how steep the drop in cases has been. The only thing that has dropped more quickly and more steeply is the new contributions in financing,” he told reporters in Geneva.  . The year-old Ebola outbreak has killed 9,976 people and fears of its spread commanded headlines globally in the second half of last year.  . Case numbers have dwindled to a range of 100-150 for almost the past eight weeks and the disease has been geographically concentrated around Freetown and Conakry, the capitals of Sierra Leone and Guinea respectively. But the failure to make further inroads is “alarming”, Aylward said.  . “Getting from here to zero is going to require another reinvestment (in the drive to tackle the outbreak).” . Liberia, where Ebola once raged, has had no new cases in 20 days but it will need to count 42 days from its last negative Ebola test result before it is declared free of the disease.  . Sierra Leone, the country worst hit by the outbreak, has reported 58 cases in the past week, the lowest figure since last June. Guinea had the same number of new cases, bringing the cumulative number of cases in all three countries to 24,282.  . It became difficult to visit, invest or work in the affected countries after Ebola struck, but the nations are in some ways even more isolated now as the epidemic retreats, Aylward said. . “Today those travel challenges still remain, direct foreign investment has not returned to the countries, and at the same time it’s no longer in the press, it’s no longer in front of people ...

Toni Clarke|(Reuters) - Consumer watchdog Public Citizen has called on U.S. health regulators to withdraw a proposal that would allow pharmaceutical companies to distribute medical literature suggesting a drug’s risk is less than stated on the label. . In a letter released on Wednesday, the organization urged Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to withdraw the proposal, saying pharmaceutical companies could “sell more drugs by making them seem safer than FDA has judged them to be.”  . Last June the Food and Drug Administration proposed allowing the distribution of new risk information about approved drugs, saying that a drug’s safety profile “evolves” as exposure to the product increases. . The FDA said it would allow distribution of new information in medical journals showing that the severity or frequency of a side effect is lower than described on the product label. The new data could even “call into question a causal relationship between a drug and an event in the approved labeling.” . Companies would not be allowed to distribute literature about newly identified risks or information that shows an already identified risk is more serious than stated on the label. Such information would need to be reviewed by the FDA and potentially included in the label. . The proposal, critics say, would strip all meaning from current laws requiring FDA approval of a drug’s label, which includes its risks, benefits and other prescribing information.  . HHS said it would respond to Public Citizen’s letter. . “Secretary Burwell appreciates hearing from stakeholders,” a spokesperson said. “The FDA is currently reviewing and considering all comments received from the dockets on the draft guidance.” . An FDA spokeswoman said the agency “does not have any specific timeline to share” on when its review might be complete.      . The FDA requested public comment on the proposal and has not yet issued final guidance. Public Citizen obtained copies of 1,771 public comments under an open records request and made them available publicly. Of those comments, roughly 99 percent oppose the proposal. . “This is a misguided FDA proposal that could result in physicians relying not on approved warning labels but on information provided by drug companies that may be more concerned with profits than patients,” wrote one commentator. . Another said “drug reps stretch the truth more than enough.” Yet another asked: “How can this be considered in any way? Where I come from you do not let the fox in the hen house.” . Among supportive comments, Public Citizen drew attention to one from the Medical Information Working Group, representing big drug companies including Allergan Inc, Amgen Inc, Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Inc, who argue they should be allowed to distribute the literature under the First Amendment.|Wed Mar 11 17:31:35 +0000 2015||FDA proposal to allow drug reps to circulate data draws protests |5.757106758524682e+17|http://reut.rs/1D6bDeA
|LONDON/FREETOWN (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday a military healthcare worker had tested positive for Ebola while working in Sierra Leone and airport officials there said the patient would be flown home overnight. . “An investigation into how the military worker was exposed to the virus is currently underway and tracing of individuals in recent contact with the diagnosed worker is being undertaken,” Public Health England said in a statement. . Airport officials said that a plane was due in at around midnight local time (07:00 pm EST) to transport the patient back to the United Kingdom. . Former colonizer Britain has sent nearly 800 soldiers to help organize a campaign to control the epidemic in Sierra Leone and to build treatment centers. In addition, hundreds of national health workers have volunteered to assist there. . Two Britons who contracted the virus have already been successfully treated at the Royal Free hospital in London, the country’s designated center, and other healthcare workers have also been treated there. . It was not immediately clear why the patient would not be treated in the British Kerry Town Ebola facility near the capital Freetown which has a special section intended for infected healthcare workers and international staff. . Ebola has now killed nearly 10,000 people in the three worst-affected countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and infected more than 24,200 people since the outbreak began in Guinea a year ago. . Rates of new infections have come down swiftly in recent months, however, and Liberia last week released its last known Ebola patient from hospital. . Sierra Leone remains the country with the highest rate of transmission and as of 10 March still had 127 patients in Ebola treatment centers across the country, according to a government health ministry report. . A clinical trial of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp’s experimental drug TKM-Ebola-Guinea was due to start on Wednesday in Sierra Leone, Britain’s Wellcome Trust global health charity said. |Wed Mar 11 17:31:35 +0000 2015||UK military healthcare worker tests positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone |5.757106741076992e+17|http://reut.rs/1B4VsHh
|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Arkansas, the third-largest U.S. turkey producer and home to Tyson Foods Inc, the nation’s biggest chicken company. . Shares of Tyson and other poultry companies, including Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc, tumbled on concerns the discovery will further limit U.S. trade with Asia and Latin America.  . Countries like Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua have already restricted poultry exports from states that have suffered bird flu outbreaks, including Minnesota, Missouri, California and Oregon. . Tyson’s stock price was down 4.9 percent at $37.85 at 12:30 p.m. CDT (1730 GMT) after hitting a five-month low of $37.35. Pilgrim’s Pride shares sank 7.3 percent, and Sanderson Farms shares lost 5.4 percent. . The infected flock of 40,020 turkeys in Boone County, Arkansas, is located within the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along which the same strain of H5N2 bird flu was previously identified in Minnesota and Missouri. . Arkansas officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, according to USDA. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.  . Confirmation of the outbreak came after the USDA said on Tuesday said there was a suspected case of bird flu in Arkansas. |Wed Mar 11 17:31:35 +0000 2015||Highly pathogenic bird flu detected in Arkansas turkey flock: USDA |5.7571067232088064e+17|http://reut.rs/1D6bDuQ
|People living in Hamburg’s St. Pauli’s nightclub district are used to hordes of drunken tourists, crime and prostitution but many are fed up with late-night revelers who urinate on public and private buildings. . A local interest group has now applied a special water-repellent paint, also used in shipbuilding, on two especially frequented buildings in the renowned nightclub district near the port to deter ‘Wildpinkler’, as Germans call them. . Ultra-Ever Dry super-hydrophobic was developed by auto-makers Nissan. Its oleophobic nano-coating is water repellant, meaning that those revelers who urinate against it will end up soaking themselves. . “Wild peeing has been a problem here for a long time. But in recent years, it got worse,” Julia Staron, who organized the group, told Reuters. . “Next week, we are also planning to paint the problem area around ‘Zur Ritze’ (nightclub) and put up the signs. But owners obviously have to approach us because we can’t just run around painting someone else’s building,” said Staron. . In a video posted on YouTube that drew 181,000 viewers on its first day alone, Staron is shown putting up signs in German and English that say: “Hier nicht pinkeln! Wir pinkeln zurueck” (Do not pee here! We pee back!). . The special hydrophobic paint is, however, expensive. . Staron said it costs about 500 euros (530 USD) to paint a six-square meter area (65 sq. feet), but that it was worth the effort and was already having a positive effect on newly protected walls.|Wed Mar 11 17:15:44 +0000 2015||Hi-tech paint gives urinating revelers a soaking |5.757066863311831e+17|http://reut.rs/1D67abA
William James|LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament approved legislation on Wednesday to ban branding on cigarette packs, drawing immediate threats of legal action from the country’s $29 billion tobacco industry. . Aimed at improving public health and cutting the number of child smokers, the measure is likely to crimp tobacco company profits and emulates Australia, which in 2012 enacted a law forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain olive green packaging with images showing the damaging effects of smoking. . British lawmakers effectively ended years of political debate, private lobbying and public consultation by passing the legislation by a margin of 367 votes to 113.  . “We want all children in our country to grow up free from the burden of disease that tobacco brings,” Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said in a statement, adding that the legislation should come into force by May 2016. . The proposal must still be debated and passed by the upper house of parliament before becoming law. . British American Tobacco told Reuters it anticipated launching a legal challenge within 30 days of the legislation’s final approval. . “We’ve been forced into a position where they’re going to be taking our property, so we will bring a legal challenge,” said Jerome Abelman, head of corporate and regulatory affairs.  . Imperial Tobacco Group said that if the measure became law the firm would be “left with no choice but to defend our legal rights in court”. Japan Tobacco International said it expected to challenge the legislation and Philip Morris International said it was prepared to seek compensation. . The new rules would initially take effect in England only, though the Welsh government has said it will follow suit and Northern Ireland and Scotland are considering a similar step. . Tobacco is responsible for 6 million deaths a year globally and the World Health Organization estimates that number could rise beyond 8 million by 2030. . As well as causing cancer and other chronic respiratory conditions, smoking is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, the world’s No. 1 killer. . “Standard packs will help reduce the number of lives blighted by this lethal product and help us move towards a tobacco free generation,” said Harpal Kumar, chief executive of the charity Cancer Research UK.  . A YouGov opinion poll conducted in February showed 72 percent of the British public supported plain packaging, with only 15 percent objecting to such proposals. . In 2014, Britain’s tobacco market was estimated to be worth  $29 billion, according to Euromonitor International, and in the same period the government provisionally estimated it collected 8.2 billion pounds ($14.24 billion) in cigarette duty. A pack of 20 cigarettes typically costs over 8 pounds ($12). . Tobacco firms have fiercely resisted the legislation, saying plain pack laws, which will also force product names to be printed in standardized fonts, infringe intellectual property rights covering brands and will increase counterfeiting and smuggling. |Wed Mar 11 16:30:52 +0000 2015||British parliament votes to ban branding on cigarette packs |5.756953958310871e+17|http://reut.rs/1B4Lk1r
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - If every man with erectile dysfunction were screened for heart disease, more than a million events like heart attack or stroke could be avoided over 20 years and more than $21 billion saved, according to a new estimate. . Treating erectile dysfunction itself would save additional money, adding up to more than $28 billion in savings, the authors project. . Erectile dysfunction (ED) has been tied to heart disease because the risk of both rises with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity and smoking, they write in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. . Not all men with ED have ED caused by vascular disease, but some do, said lead author Dr. Alexander W. Pastuszak of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. . “If you are able to identify the men with ED caused by vascular disease, which also causes (cardiovascular disease), then you can treat those men and prevent cardiovascular events such as heart disease and stroke,” he told Reuters Health by email. . For the new estimate, the authors reviewed literature on the occurrence of ED among men with cardiovascular disease. . Comparing Medicare reimbursements for cardiovascular risk factor screening to the average cost per acute cardiovascular event, the authors estimated how much increased screening would cost and how much it would save by preventing more severe health problems. . More than 18 million men in the U.S. have ED, more than eight million men have cardiovascular disease, and about two million have both, the authors write. . Men with cardiovascular disease risk factors who begin taking statin medications and otherwise treating their condition reduce their risk of an acute heart event by almost 20 percent over the next five years. Based on that, the authors assumed that screening and treating these men would reduce the number of acute events over the same period by 20 percent. . The study team notes that it costs an average of $138 dollars to screen men with ED for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes and it would cost the same man more than $11,000 for an acute event like a heart attack.  . Over the next 20 years, more than five million men who visit the doctor with ED will likely have undiagnosed high blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes, the authors project. Screening and treating these men would cost $2.6 billion and prevent 55,000 acute heart events, saving $20.4 billion in treatment expenditures. . Treating the underlying risk factors would eliminate more than a million cases of ED as well, saving an additional $9.7 billion on ED medications over time. . The link between ED and cardiovascular disease was uncovered in 2000, after drugs like Viagra had become available, according to Dr. Charalambos Vlachopoulos of the Cardiovascular Diseases and Sexual Health Unit of Athens Medical School in Greece, who was not involved in the new research. . ED comes from dysfunction of the small arteries of the penis at the level of the blood vessels’ inner lining, he told Reuters Health, and that dysfunction extends to arteries throughout the body. . Most men who have ED and cardiovascular disease start experiencing erectile dysfunction two to three years before a heart event, Vlachopoulos said.  . Men with trouble getting or maintaining an erection should visit their doctors and be evaluated for underlying heart risk factors, Pastuszak said. Screening is easy and involves evaluating exercise ability by asking whether men are able to walk a mile on flat land in 20 minutes or climb two flights of stairs in 10 seconds without any chest discomfort, blood tests to check for diabetes and altered blood lipids, and blood pressure measurement, he said. . “Not all people with ED have to undergo a thorough cardiological screening,” Vlachopoulos said. “If they have a higher risk profile, if they have diabetes or hypertension or hypercholesterolemia then they have to consult with a cardiac specialist, especially if they have symptoms like chest pain, fatigue or shortness of breath,” he said. . “Many men are afraid of seeing a doctor and would rather suffer silently,” Pastuszak said. “These men should also know that they shouldn’t be afraid to talk about their ED, and should join the national conversation about ED and the growing number of men who are seeing their physicians for ED and getting treatment not only for their ED but also for the CVD that may be as yet undiagnosed.”  . “Finally, and perhaps most importantly, men should know that early diagnosis and treatment of CVD and its risk factors can save them not only money, but can improve their quality of life by preventing more morbid cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke,” Pastuszak said.   .

|LONDON (Reuters) - A clinical trial of Tekmira’s experimental drug TKM-Ebola-Guinea will start on Wednesday in Sierra Leone, Britain’s Wellcome Trust global health charity said. . The drug, a so-called “synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic”, is designed specifically to target the strain of Ebola virus causing a vast epidemic centered mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . An earlier version of the TKM-Ebola drug — targeted at a different strain — has already been tested in healthy human volunteers.  . The efficacy of the Guinea version will now be tested in Ebola patients in a fast-tracked trial funded by Wellcome, with results expected in the second half of this year, the charity said in a statement. |Wed Mar 11 14:49:06 +0000 2015||Trial of Tekmira's TKM-Ebola treatment starts in Sierra Leone |5.756697839637791e+17|http://reut.rs/1B4tprv
P.J. Huffstutter|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc has removed gentamicin, a key antibiotic for human use, from company hatcheries, the company told Reuters on Tuesday. . Arkansas-based Tyson, the nation’s largest chicken producer, said the drug and other antibiotics have not been used at its 35 hatcheries since Oct. 1, 2014. The company had not previously given details of what drugs were used at the hatcheries, where chicks are born and kept briefly before being moved to poultry farms. . Gentamicin is a member of an antibiotic class considered “highly important” in human medicine by the federal Food and Drug Administration. . The poultry industry has long been under pressure to stop feeding medically important antibiotics to otherwise healthy livestock. Meat companies have used the drugs both to stave off disease and to promote more rapid growth. . Last week, McDonald’s Corp said its U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections. Tyson Foods is a major chicken supplier to McDonald’s. . Tyson told Reuters this week it is also testing alternatives to medically-important antibiotics for use on the farms that house its chickens after they leave the hatcheries. It says it does not use antibiotics for growth promotion on the farms, but does use them, according to its website, “when prescribed by a veterinarian to treat or prevent disease.” . Rival chicken producer Perdue Farms announced last summer that it had stopped using all antibiotics in its hatcheries, including gentamicin, because it wanted “to move away from conventional antibiotic use” due to “growing consumer concern and our own questions about the practice.” . Gentamicin has been commonly used in hatcheries to fight off infection or prevent disease, including in fertilized eggs, livestock veterinarians and other poultry producers say. . Tyson sees the policy shift as “a significant first step toward our goal of reducing the use of antibiotics that are also used in human medicine,” according to its website. . Tyson has reduced the volume of medically-important antibiotics used in its chicken business by 84 percent since 2011 and the “vast majority of the antibiotics used to raise our chickens are never used in humans,” according to a company statement. . While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, the risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans. Reuters found last year that major U.S. poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized. |Wed Mar 11 11:44:14 +0000 2015||Tyson continues effort to cut antibiotics from chicken production |5.756232589906043e+17|http://reut.rs/1B3WHqc
|ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss organization that helps people take their own lives and defends their right to refuse medical treatment says its membership reached a record high last year after a 20 percent surge in requests to join. . Exit, which provides lethal drugs to help the terminally ill die, said on Wednesday its membership rose to 81,015 people in the German- and Italian-speaking part of Switzerland up from 67,602 in 2013. It helped 583 people to die in 2014.  . The organization attributed the rise to an aging population, rising numbers of patients suffering from dementia, and a greater desire among people to determine the course of their lives. . It also said the surge may have been prompted by media coverage of a vote by members last year to extend its services to elderly people who are not terminally ill, such as those suffering from psychological or physical problems. . Assisted suicide is permitted in Switzerland if performed by someone with no direct interest in the death. It is however illegal for someone to deliver the lethal dose rather than just making it available to the person who wishes to die. . Swiss organizations such as Exit and Dignitas have gained international attention as a result. In 2009, prominent British orchestra conductor Sir Edward Downes and his wife traveled to Switzerland in order to end their lives through assisted suicide, according to their family at the time. . In Europe, euthanasia is legal only in Belgium and the Netherlands. The French parliament is debating a bill that would let doctors put terminally ill patients into “deep sedation” until they die. |Wed Mar 11 09:56:03 +0000 2015||Record numbers sign up to Swiss right-to-die organization |5.755960338053202e+17|http://reut.rs/1D4mtBE
|LONDON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament are expected to vote to ban branding on cigarette packs by a large margin later on Wednesday, a move that would force manufacturers to adopt plain packets in England by 2016. . The measure, aimed at improving public health and cutting the number of child smokers, is likely to crimp tobacco firms’ profits and would emulate Australia, which two years ago enacted a law forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain olive green packaging with images showing the damaging effects of smoking. . Lawmakers are expected to vote according to their consciences rather than under party political instruction, and a significant minority of parliamentarians from Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative Party is likely to try but fail to derail the measure. . Lawmakers will not debate the matter, which has already been the subject of years of lobbying and consultations.   . The new rules would initially take effect in England only, though the Welsh government has said it will follow suit and Northern Ireland and Scotland are considering a similar step. . Tobacco firms have fiercely resisted the new law, saying plain packs infringe on intellectual property rights covering brands and will only increase counterfeiting and smuggling.  |Wed Mar 11 08:59:54 +0000 2015||Parliament set to vote to ban branding on cigarette packs |5.755819042436833e+17|http://reut.rs/1D4aBj8
|LONDON (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s cancer drug Keytruda, which works by boosting the immune system but has yet to be licensed in Europe, is the first medicine to be made available to patients in Britain under a new early access scheme. . The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said on Wednesday that the treatment had been cleared to treat adults and children from 12 years of age with advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, after other drugs had failed. . Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, was accepted under the scheme based on the significance of early study findings and unmet medical need. It had already received a “promising innovative medicine” designation in Britain in October 2014. . The British initiative, which has similarities with a U.S. scheme that has accelerated the development of so-called “breakthrough” medicines, follows criticism that Britain’s state-run healthcare system is too slow to adopt new treatments. . The new early access program is funded by drug companies. . While Keytruda is already approved in the United States, Merck’s application for marketing authorization in Europe is still under review. |Wed Mar 11 08:08:02 +0000 2015||Merck cancer drug is first approved under UK early access scheme |5.755688520058757e+17|http://reut.rs/1B3qRKe
Naomi Tajitsu|WELLINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese demand for New Zealand infant formula has fallen after a threat by suspected environmental activists to contaminate the product with an agricultural poison, the head of an exporter group said on Wednesday.  . Orders for infant formula, prized among China’s growing middle class, have slumped after New Zealand police on Tuesday said letters were sent to the national farmers’ group and dairy giant Fonterra in November accompanied by packages of infant formula laced with poisonous pesticide 1080, formally called sodium fluoroacetate. . Following the announcement, China said it would increase scrutiny of milk powder imports from New Zealand, which depends on dairy products for about a quarter of its export earnings. . China is New Zealand’s biggest dairy buyer, purchasing $3.11 billion worth of milk powder and other products in 2014, nearly one-third of all global exports. The announcement has stung the New Zealand dollar which hit a five-week low on Wednesday. . Small New Zealand companies marketing formula in China were already seeing a cut in orders, said Michael Barnett, chairman of the New Zealand Infant Formula Exporters Association. . “We’ve had our first response from the distribution network. They’ve reduced their orders, some of them by up to 70 percent,” he told Reuters, adding that any negative online exposure could fan concerns in China. . The association includes small businesses which brand and market infant formula products manufactured by Fonterra and other New Zealand dairy companies. . China said it was stepping up measures to examine New Zealand milk powder even as New Zealand’s agriculture ministry (MPI) on Wednesday reiterated that the pesticide had not entered the dairy supply chain. . “China has already taken steps and will demand each batch of milk powder imported from New Zealand has an official New Zealand certificate that it does not contain 1080,” China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on its website. . The MPI said it began informing and consulting with major overseas dairy customers and regulators about the threat in the last three to four weeks, roughly a month after Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, began testing dairy products for the poison in mid-January. . “The overseas markets and regulators we’ve reached out to are responding in a very calm way,” said Scott Gallacher, director-general of the Ministry of Primary Industries. . The scare is the latest threat to New Zealand’s dairy sector, which exported nearly $11 billion in milk products in 2014, and follows a contamination scare in 2013, when a botulism-causing bacteria was believed to be found in one of Fonterra’s products. The discovery was found to be false.  |Wed Mar 11 03:29:01 +0000 2015||China to scrutinize New Zealand milk powder imports after poisoning scare |5.7549863588818125e+17|http://reut.rs/1B2QRp0
Tom Polansek|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A suspected case of avian influenza has been identified in poultry in Arkansas, the third-largest U.S. turkey producer and home to Tyson Foods Inc, the nation’s biggest chicken company, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday.    The infection, if confirmed, threatens to widen trading restrictions from countries such as Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua that have already limited U.S. poultry exports due to bird flu outbreaks in states ranging from Minnesota and Missouri to California. . “There is a suspect case in Arkansas, but testing is ongoing,” USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said. . Arkansas producers have been on alert for the virus since Minnesota and Missouri confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu in the past week. The Minnesota case was the first in the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along the Mississippi River that also includes Missouri and Arkansas.    Bird flu is contagious and can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 48 hours. The virus has not been identified in humans and is not expected to pose a public health risk, according to USDA. . “It’s in the wild bird flyway coming from Canada,” Texas state veterinarian Dee Ellis said of the virus. “That’s obviously how it went from Minnesota to Missouri to Arkansas.”    Ellis could not confirm the Arkansas case. . On Wednesday, Texas will announce strengthened testing requirements for poultry coming in from states with bird flu outbreaks in a bid to keep out the virus, he said.    No flocks grown for Tyson have been diagnosed with bird flu, spokesman Worth Sparkman said, adding the company had become more diligent about biosecurity at poultry farms because of the virus.    The suspected case in Arkansas was found in a turkey flock, said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms Inc, the nation’s third-largest poultry producer. He cited information from the Texas Poultry Federation.To prevent bird flu from spreading to its facilities, Sanderson is starting to bar outsiders from entering barns and to require increased cleaning of trucks hauling feed and chickens between farms, Cockrell said. In the past, employees have changed their clothes on airplanes after visiting infected locations, he added. . Transmission “can happen, whether it comes in on feces on your boot or a piece of a feather that got on a shirt when you’re out doing environmental inspections on a farm,” Cockrell said.H5N2 was also found in turkey flocks in Minnesota and Missouri. The facilities were immediately quarantined, flocks were culled and authorities said the birds would not enter the food system. |Wed Mar 11 03:29:01 +0000 2015||Suspected bird flu in Arkansas poultry threatens exports |5.7549863385399706e+17|http://reut.rs/1D3cfkU

Transmission “can happen, whether it comes in on feces on your boot or a piece of a feather that got on a shirt when you’re out doing environmental inspections on a farm,” Cockrell said.  . H5N2 was also found in turkey flocks in Minnesota and Missouri. The facilities were immediately quarantined, flocks were culled and authorities said the birds would not enter the food system.        |Tue Mar 10 23:14:32 +0000 2015||Suspected bird flu case found in Arkansas poultry, USDA says |5.754345901956956e+17|http://reut.rs/1D2o7E0
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - For people with heart disease, high levels of stress coupled with depression increase the risk of heart attack and death, according to a new study. . “We found that the combination of high stress and high depression symptoms was particularly harmful for adults with heart disease during an early vulnerability period,” said lead author Carmela Alcantara of Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. . Alcantara and colleagues followed more than 4,400 people age 45 and older with coronary heart disease, a buildup of plaque in the arteries which is the most common form of heart disease. . Between 2003 and 2007, participants had in-home examinations and completed stress and depression questionnaires. For example, they reported how often during the previous week they felt depressed, lonely or cried, and how often during the past months they felt overwhelmed or like life was out of their control. . Almost 12 percent of the participants had high stress, almost 14 percent had high levels of depression and 6 percent reported having both. . After roughly six years of follow-up, 1,337 participants had  a heart attack or died.  . The 6 percent of people with both high stress and depression were 48 percent more likely to die or have a heart attack within two and a half years of the home visit than people without both of these risk factors.  . There was no increased risk over longer periods or for people with either depression or stress, but not both, according to results in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. . “We were surprised that high stress, and high depression, alone did not increase the risk of another heart attack or death, in analyses that accounted for important medical, behavioral, and demographic factors,” Alcantara told Reuters Health by email. . Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health, but it can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes. . Previous studies tied stress and depression to the development of heart disease as well, though this study was limited to people who already had the condition, Alcantara said. . “More research is needed to understand why psychosocial factors like these are so often tied to heart health in particular,” she said. . During periods of stress, the part of the nervous system that regulate the heart and other organs “makes the heart beat harder and faster causing blood pressure to increase, a potential cause of heart attacks and strokes,” Dr. Phil Chowienczyk, who was not part of the Circulation study, wrote in an email to Reuters Health. . In a recent paper in the journal Hypertension, Chowienczyk and colleagues from the King’s College London report that normally, the body regulates blood flow by releasing a molecule that lets blood vessels open wider to prevent blood pressure from rising too much. . People with high blood pressure seem to release less of that molecule, particularly during stress, according to their findings - and this may contribute to stress-induced cardiovascular crises. . Behavioral stress and depression management therapies may help improve medical outcomes for people with heart disease, Alcantara said, but more research is needed in that area. . SOURCES: .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - More young people in Britain are learning about sex at school than years ago, according to a series of surveys. . The trend toward school-based education may be positive, said Dr. Clare Tanton, the study’s lead author from the University College London.  . As schools educate young people about sex, education from less “authoritative sources” like friends and first sexual partners becomes less common, she noted.  . “School-based sex ed has the potential to reduce inequalities in information and we found that those reporting school as their main source were less likely to report wanting more information,” Tanton told Reuters Health by email. . As reported in the journal BMJ Open, the researchers analyzed data from a survey conducted between 2010 and 2012 of nearly 4,000 people ages 16 to 24. Their answers were compared with previous surveys from 1990–1991 and 1999-2001.  . The young people identified where they learned about sexual matters, and where specifically they had learned the most. Their options included family members, friends, school lessons and doctors. . They chose from a list of factors they would have liked to know more about when they eventually did start having sex, like sexual feelings, how to say “no,” contraception or masturbation. . Roughly four out of 10 people reported in 2010-2012 that school had been their main source of sexual information when they were growing up. This was an increase from about three out of 10 people in 1990-1991. . In 2010-2012, about a quarter of respondents said their friends were the main source of information. About 7 percent of men and about 14 percent of women said their parents were their main sources of information about sex. . About 12 percent of men and about 5 percent of women said their first sexual partner educated them most about sex.  . Some young people – mostly men – reported the Internet and pornography as their main sources of information about sex. . While roughly 70 percent of people wished they had more information before becoming sexually active, that rate was similar to past studies. . In a companion analysis, the authors found that people whose main source of information was school, particularly women, tended to start having sex at an older age, use safer sex practices, and have fewer experiences with abortion or distress around sexual experiences. . But Tanton said the quality of school-based sex education is variable in Britain.  . One 2013 report found that sex and relationship education needed improvement in about a third of schools, she said. Many focused more on the mechanics of intercourse than on actual relationships. . “It is important that wider aspects sexual health and of healthy relationships are considered from both young women’s and young men’s perspective,” said Dr. Wendy Macdowall of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. . Macdowall, the lead author of the companion analysis, said it was surprising to see how low parents featured on the list of sources and how gendered it was. . Many men would have preferred their fathers to have been a main source of information, but that was rarely the case, Tanton noted. . Macdowall said more than half of young men and just under half of young women did not report an “authoritative” main source of information, like parents, school or doctors. . It’s hard to say if these findings would have been similar in other countries, Tanton said. . SOURCE: .  and .

Lindsay Dunsmuir|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Johnson & Johnson subsidiary pleaded guilty on Tuesday to selling liquid medicine contaminated with metal and agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday. . The subsidiary, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, pleaded guilty to one federal criminal charge in the case.  . In 2010, the company launched mass recalls of certain children’s over-the-counter-medicines, including Infants’ Tylenol and Children’s Motrin, made at its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania plant. . It was the latest in a series of recalls at the time. There were far-reaching multiple recalls from 2008 to 2010 involving hundreds of millions of bottles and packages of consumer brands such as Tylenol, Motrin, Rolaids, Benadryl and other products due to faulty manufacturing. The recalls kept widely used products such as Children’s Tylenol off pharmacy shelves and seriously tarnished J&J’s once-sterling reputation. .     In addition to metal particles getting into liquid medicines, there were moldy odors and labeling problems. For example, the label for Sudafed allergy tablets incorrectly repeated the word “not” to say “do not not divide, crush, chew or dissolve the tablet.” . In the case involving metal particles, the troubles began in May 2009 when a consumer complained after noticing “black specks” in the bottom of a bottle of Infants’ Tylenol. The specks were found to be nickel and chromium particles. .     In 2010, Johnson & Johnson’s U.S. consumer product sales fell by more than 19 percent, a decrease of $900 million. The rash of consumer medicine recalls in 2009 and 2010 were largely responsible for the first back-to-back years of company sales declines since World War Two. . Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for McNeil Consumer Healthcare, said the plea agreement “closes a chapter” and that the company has “been implementing enhanced quality and oversight standards across its entire business.” . As part of the agreement, McNeil also agreed to further safety measures before reopening its Fort Washington facility. |Tue Mar 10 20:50:32 +0000 2015||Tylenol maker to pay $25 million for selling metal-contaminated drugs |5.753983539383337e+17|http://reut.rs/1B1GmlP
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - A modified Mediterranean diet with local foods may be easier for some people to stick with and also result in weight loss, suggests a new study from Germany. . People on a Mediterranean diet that used more familiar foods and portion-controlled sweets lost weight after 12 weeks and kept most of it off for one year, researchers report. . They write in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition that Mediterranean diets high in olive oil and nuts help people lose weight and prevent heart disease. . But some people, including those in Europe and outside the Mediterranean, may find it difficult to stick with such a diet, they add. . To test a modified diet, Anja Austel from Gottingen University Medical School in Germany and colleagues randomly assigned 225 overweight or obese Swedish adults to follow the diet right from the start of the study, or to be added to a waiting list for 12 weeks and then follow the diet.  . Participants also received information about keeping off the weight they lost. . Unlike the traditional Mediterranean diet’s emphasis on olive oil and nuts, the modified diet substituted local flavors like neutral- and butter-flavor canola oil, walnut oil and walnuts. It also allowed for two portion-controlled sweets per day. . The California Walnut Commission and the Taste of Sweden Deutschland, who manufactured the flavored canola oil, funded the study. Oil and walnuts were provided to the participants for free. . After 12 weeks on the diet, participants lost an average of just over 11 pounds. The average waist measurement fell by almost two inches. . By comparison, while they were on the waiting list, members of the control group lost an average of one pound, and had almost no change in waist circumference. . After 12 weeks on the diet, participants also had a reduced body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight in relation to height. There was hardly any change in BMI while people were on the waiting list. . About 72 percent of the participants complied with the diet during the first 12 weeks, and about half made it through the year - at which point they had kept off about nine pounds. Their cholesterol also improved. . Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian with the heart and vascular group at the Cleveland Clinic who wasn’t involved with the study, said she was impressed by the amount of weight lost during the study. . “Typically what we suggest, just in general and as well as from a long term weight management standpoint, is if you lose about a pound a week you’re more likely to sustain that weight loss,” she said. . Dr. Miguel Angel Martinez-Gonzalez, who also was not involved with the new study, told Reuters Health by email that the study was “well designed, and it adds to the potential transferability of the Mediterranean diet to other non-Mediterranean settings.” . Martinez-Gonzalez of the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, said the traditional Mediterranean diet does allow for some flexibility.  . He said the diet has six major beneficial components: olive oil (especially extra virgin olive oil), fruits and nuts, vegetables, legumes, cereals and whole grains and fish. Meat and dairy products are presumed to be detrimental and should only be consumed sparingly, and red wine can be consumed in small amounts.  . Zumpano thinks people can get the benefits of a Mediterranean diet even if they substitute different oils. . “If you don’t like olive oil, use walnut oil,” she said. “I think peanut oil is fine, I think sunflower oil is fine – any of your polyunsaturated fatty acids.” .

Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) - Surgery to change penis appearance may not do much to stop locker-room teasing in high school, a new study suggests. . The urologists who conducted the study say parents who bring their young sons to be circumcised - or to get rid of some leftover foreskin after a circumcision - often say they’re worried that their child may be teased later in life because of the appearance of his penis.  . “We were looking to find out if the parents’ concerns about teasing in the locker room were valid,” said Dr. Chris Cooper, the study’s senior author from the University of Iowa.  . As reported this month in The Journal of Urology, the researchers surveyed 290 undergraduate men at the University of Iowa about their high school gym classes and sports and any teasing they witnessed or experienced in the locker rooms. . Overall, 47 percent had seen others being teased about their penises - usually on a weekly basis. . Penis size was the reason for 83 percent of the taunts, the researchers found. A third of taunts focused on not being circumcised or having a “strange” looking penis. . Only 10 percent of the students reported actually being teased themselves, but Cooper said that may be an underestimate. Again, though, penis size and being uncircumcised were commonly to blame for the teasing. . The vast majority of the college students in the survey were circumcised, the researchers write. There was no difference between the uncircumcised and circumcised groups when the students were asked if they wished their penis had a different appearance. . The researchers found that the experience of being teased or witnessing teasing also did not have a significant effect on whether students wished for a different penile appearance. . Furthermore, being uncircumcised did not increase a student’s overall odds of being teased. . “The question then becomes: for those young men who were teased, would corrective surgery have made a difference?” Cooper said in a phone interview. . The answer, he said, is that while some children might benefit from having surgery to correct the appearance of their penis, the main subject of teasing - size - is not correctable by surgery. . Cooper said the study’s results are limited, because they only surveyed one group of men from one Midwestern college, with  higher-than-average circumcision rates. . 	Charbel El Bcheraoui, a global health researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved with the new study, told Reuters Health by email that teasing “is a form of verbal bullying which can have long-term and short-term psychological effects on the victim.” . Those risks include social isolation and decreased self-esteem, said El Bcheraoui. . This type of teasing should be addressed using social and educational strategies, he said. . As for whether an individual should undergo surgery to alter the appearance of his penis, Cooper said it’s ultimately a judgment call. .

Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly 11.7 million people have either signed up or re-enrolled for insurance coverage under the U.S. healthcare reform law, more than the 9.1 million predicted by the Obama administration,health officials said on Tuesday. . As of Feb. 22, about 8.8 million signed up in one of the 37 states that use online exchanges operated by the federal government and 2.85 million were in the 14 states, and Washington, D.C., that operate their own exchanges, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. . The Democratic-backed Affordable Care Act, narrowly passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition, aimed to help millions of Americans without health insurance obtain coverage. Conservatives criticize the law, commonly called  Obamacare, as government overreach. . The online exchanges, or marketplaces, are geared toward those who do not receive insurance through their employer and provide tax subsidies on a sliding scale to make health coverage affordable for low-income people. . In the states that use the federal exchange, called healthcare.gov, 87 percent qualified for a tax credit averaging $263 per month, according to HHS. It said more than half of consumers in states using healthcare.gov bought a plan that cost $100 or less after tax credits. . Enrollment across the board has largely exceeded expectations, health officials said. The enrollment period for 2015 coverage opened on Nov. 15 and closed on Feb. 15.     . President Barack Obama’s healthcare policy has been challenged in the courts since the outset. In the latest case, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on March 4 and is expected to decide this year whether or not to throw out tax subsidies in states that do not operate their own marketplaces. . If the court rules against the Obama administration, up to 7.5 million people in at least 34 states would lose the tax subsidies, according to consulting firm Avalere Health. . More than 4.1 million people under 35 years old have purchased health insurance through state and federal exchanges, the HHS said Tuesday, about a third of enrollees. |Tue Mar 10 20:19:18 +0000 2015||Nearly 11.7 million signed up for Obamacare health insurance: HHS |5.753904928101663e+17|http://reut.rs/1D1IRM8
Kathryn Doyle| (In para 15 (3rd para from bottom), corrects attribution of quote by changing “she said” to “Beebe-Dimmer said”.) . By Kathryn Doyle . (Reuters Health) - Women with close male relatives with prostate cancer are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, a new study confirms. . These findings, from the large Women’s Health Initiative, reinforce the results of a 1994 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the authors write. . “This is not the first study to examine this relationship, but it is one of the larger to date, if not the largest study,” said lead author Jennifer L. Beebe-Dimmer of Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit. . Cancer is a disease of the DNA, she said, and family clustering indicates that breast and prostate cancers may have genes in common, . Beebe-Dimmer and her colleagues used data for more than 78,000 women in the Women’s Health Initiative who were over age 50 and cancer-free when the study began in 1993. At the start they had comprehensive physical exams and gave detailed personal and family medical histories. . Most women remained in the study for more than 10 years. . By 2009 there had been 3,506 new breast cancers in the original group.  . Overall, more than 11,000 women had a first-degree relative – mother, sister or daughter - with breast cancer, and this was more common for those who were eventually diagnosed themselves. Twenty percent of women with breast cancer had first-degree relatives with the disease, compared to nearly 15 percent of those who did not develop breast cancer. . There was a similar, but very slight, association with prostate cancer, the researchers reported in Cancer.  . More than 11 percent of women who developed breast cancer reported a first-degree relative with prostate cancer, compared to about 10 percent of women without the disease. Having a father, brother or son with prostate cancer increased the risk of breast cancer by about 14 percent. . Compared to women with no family history of breast or prostate cancer, those with a family history of both were 80 percent more likely to develop breast cancer, the authors found. . “We know that the major breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also linked to prostate cancer,” Beebe-Dimmer told Reuters Health by email. That may explain some of the clustering, she said. . Researchers have been reporting on familial links between breast and prostate cancer for 40 years, said Mary-Claire King of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, in email to Reuters Health.  . “It is good to see the link confirmed” in the Women’s Health Initiative, said King, who was not involved in the new research. . “Both of these cancers are relatively common, so that it is possible when cancers are diagnosed in multiple family members it may be due to chance,” Beebe-Dimmer said. “It may also be an exposure to something in the environment.” . The decision to increase breast cancer screening will depend on how many male relatives have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and at what age, she said, with more diagnoses at young ages being particularly telling. . “Knowledge of breast cancer family history is still extremely important,” Beebe-Dimmer said. She would not recommend BRCA1 or 2 genetic testing for women with a family history of prostate cancer but no history of breast or ovarian cancer. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - A smoker trying to kick the habit may be better off alone than with a spouse or partner who also smokes, a new study suggests. . “If your partner smokes, and you need to quit, it’s harder to succeed than it would be if you were living alone,” said Rachel Margolis, a sociology researcher at the University of Western Ontario. . Margolis and her coauthor Laura Wright mined data from 5,250 smokers ages 50 to 85 who participated in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study between 1992 and 2010. Participants were interviewed an average of about six times, over the course of about 12 years. . At the first interview, participants were on average about 56 years old and they typically smoked about 17 cigarettes a day, slightly less than a pack. Slightly more than half of the participants stopped smoking at some point during the study period. . Those who got separated or divorced had the lowest success rate for quitting smoking: 51 percent. People who stayed with a smoker had a 52 percent success rate.  . About 60 percent of those who lived alone were successful at quitting. But the odds were highest, at about 68 percent, for people with a non-smoking partner or a partner who tried to quit at the same time. . To be sure, not every marriage is the same, and the authors didn’t have data on the quality of relationships or the many aspects of spousal behavior that might impact attempts to quit smoking. They also didn’t have enough same-sex couples to compare their success to heterosexual peers, and they couldn’t tell how cohabitation stacked up against marriage.  . Still, the study is part of an emerging field of research that is upending traditional notions of marriage as automatically beneficial for health, Margolis said. . “The older research was really looking at marital status and health at one point in time and taking a picture that was way too simple for our social world,” she said. “One of the things this study does is look at the fact that partnership is varied, and partnership is not static.” . There are many nuances to the relationships people have with their partners, as well as with friends and family, that can impact their ability to quit, said Mieke Beth Thomeer, a sociology researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  . If they do quit, how well it sticks for people in relationships will depend a great deal on what’s happening in the home, said Thomeer, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . “There’s a difference between trying to quit when your partner smokes in the house and when they can’t smoke in your presence,” Thomeer said. “It may be that if your spouse is the only person still smoking in your life that might not be as influential as if all of your other friends still smoke.”  .

Anastasia Moloney|BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Brazil, where a woman is killed every two hours, is imposing tougher punishments on those who murder women and girls, as part of a government bid to stem a rise in gender killings.  . President Dilma Rousseff said the new law gave a legal definition to the crime of femicide - the killing of a woman by a man because of her gender - and set out jail sentences of 12 to 30 years for convicted offenders. . The law also includes longer jail terms for crimes committed against pregnant women, girls under 14, women over 60 and people with disabilities. . Brazil joins 15 other Latin American countries which have brought in laws against femicide in recent years. . “This law typifies femicide as a grave crime and identifies it as a specific crime against women. It’s a way to talk about this problem, make it visible by giving it a name and increasing sanctions for this crime,” said Nadine Gasman, head of the agency United Nations Women in Brazil. . “It has taken us a long time to say that the killing of a woman is a different phenomenon. Men are killed in the street, women are killed in the home. Men are killed with guns, women with knives and hands,” Gasman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. . The number of women murdered in Brazil rose by 230 percent from 1980 to 2010, government figures show. . An average of 4,500 women are killed in the country every year, Gasman said. . “Femicide is part of the big increase in violence in general in Brazil. The underlying causes are discrimination against women and inequality, and in Brazil black women are the poorest and the most discriminated against,” she said. . More research is needed to better understand the reasons for the big increase in gender killings in Brazil, Gasman said. . Femicide is a widespread problem across Latin America.  . More than half the 25 countries with the highest femicide rates are in the Americas, according to a 2012 report by the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project in Geneva, based on 2004 to 2009 figures. . It is common for victims of femicide to have a long history of domestic violence and the perpetrators are often the victims’ current or former partners, family members or friends, U.N. Women says. . “Our experience in the region and in Brazil shows femicide is part of a cycle of violence and it’s the most intense form of violence ... that becomes graver and graver. It doesn’t come out of the blue,” Gasman said. . Femicide also stems from a macho culture that tends to condone violence against women and blames women for it, which in turn leads to low prosecution rates for gender-related crimes.  . “This is a further step in Brazil’s legislation in the fight against sexism that kills women daily in our country,” Brazilian congresswoman Maria do Rosario said on her Facebook page, after the femicide law was introduced. . The challenge now is to ensure that the law is put into practice and that police, prosecutors and forensic experts are trained in how to investigate cases of femicide. . “It’s always a challenge implementing laws but having this law makes it compulsory to investigate this crime with a gender perspective,” Gasman said.  |Tue Mar 10 18:19:34 +0000 2015||Brazil passes femicide law to tackle rise in gender killings |5.753603629896417e+17|http://reut.rs/1D1goWH
Alisa Tang|BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Researchers have long puzzled over why children in India, despite being wealthier, are shorter and smaller than children in sub-Saharan Africa. . At least part of the answer may be a patriarchal society that puts young women on the lowest rung of the social ladder, according to a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). . Delhi-based economist Diane Coffey found that maternal health in India is worse than previously believed, and that  42.2 percent of Indian women of childbearing age are underweight. . “In India, young, newly married women are at the bottom of household hierarchies, and have even lower social status than older women,” said Coffey, a doctoral student at Princeton and visiting researcher at the Delhi School of Economics. . “At the same time that Indian women become pregnant, they are often expected to keep quiet, work hard and eat little,” she said, adding that young women cook family meals but often eat only leftovers, after everyone else has finished. . Because weight gain during pregnancy averages 7 kg in both India and Africa - compared with U.S. recommendations of 12.5 to 18 kg for underweight women - many Indian women reach full-term pregnancy weighing less than an average pre-pregnant sub-Saharan African woman. . Infants whose mothers do not weigh enough when they are born are more likely to die in the first month of life or be underweight themselves, leading to stunted physical and cognitive growth later in life. . Before Coffey’s new estimates, the most commonly cited statistic was from the Indian government’s latest demographic and health survey from 2005, showing that 35.5 percent of all adult women, aged 15 to 49, are underweight, she said. . However, pregnancy in India is concentrated between the ages of 18 and 25, so Coffey adjusted the statistics and arrived at a more precise figure for underweight women in that age range, nearly 7 percentage points higher. . By contrast, in much poorer Africa, 16.5 percent of pre-pregnant women are underweight, the study said. . Coffey recommends the Indian government set up a monitoring system to get more accurate numbers, and implement the National Food Security Act (NFSA) passed in 2013, which includes a provision of 6,000 rupees ($95) in maternity benefits. . “Although there are no easy solutions for the crisis of maternal underweight in India, it is extremely disappointing that last month’s budget didn’t allocate funds for universal maternity benefits,” said Coffey, who founded and heads the nonprofit Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (rice).  . “Implementing this Act, which was passed nearly two years ago, would be a good first step in addressing the problem,” she added. |Tue Mar 10 17:09:54 +0000 2015||Many young Indian women underweight, their babies too: research |5.753428293938299e+17|http://reut.rs/1D0YpQ1
|(Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration said it approved United Therapeutics Corp’s drug to treat neuroblastoma, a rare cancer that typically occurs in children below 5 years. . Unituxin is the first drug approved to treat high-risk neuroblastoma patients who have a greater chance of tumors recurring or progressing after chemotherapy. . There are an estimated 650 cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed in the United States each year. The disease, slightly more common in boys, forms from immature nerve cells. . Unituxin, a combination of mouse and human DNA, is an antibody that sticks to the surface of the cancer-affected cells and uses the body’s immune system to destroy the cells.  . The safety and effectiveness of the drug were tested in a clinical trial comprising 226 patients.

|(Reuters) - Highly effective but expensive new pills to treat hepatitis C drove a 13.1 percent increase U.S. prescription drug spending in 2014, the fastest rate of increase in more than a decade, according to Express Scripts. . The company, which is the biggest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits and administers pharmaceutical care for many leading employers, has warned frequently about the runaway cost of new medicines now reaching the market. . Its 2014 drug trend report, released on Tuesday, showed that spending on specialty drugs, including conditions like cancer and multiple sclerosis as well as hepatitis C, made up more than 31 percent of drug expenditure last year. . “For the past several years, annual drug spending increases have been below the annual rate of overall healthcare inflation in the U.S., but that paradigm is shifting dramatically as prices for medications increase at an unprecedented and unsustainable rate,” Glen Stettin, Express Scripts senior vice president of clinical, research and new solutions said in a statement. . The United States spent 743 percent more on hepatitis C drugs in 2014 than in 2013, according to Express Scripts, reflecting the arrival of new pills Harvoni and Sovaldi from Gilead Sciences and Viekira Pak from Abbvie. . Upcoming innovations, including a wave of novel immune-system boosting cancer drugs and so-called PCSK9 inhibitors for high cholesterol, will continue to challenge U.S. healthcare providers, the company added. |Tue Mar 10 13:17:47 +0000 2015||Hepatitis C pills drive surge in U.S. drug costs: report |5.75284416076972e+17|http://reut.rs/1B07WQq
Naomi Tajitsu|WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Suspected environmental activists have threatened to contaminate infant formula in New Zealand, the world’s largest dairy exporter, in an attempt to halt the use of an agricultural poison on pests such as rats and possums. . New Zealand police said on Tuesday letters were sent to the national farmers’ group and dairy giant Fonterra in November accompanied by packages of infant formula laced with 1080, demanding that use of the toxic pesticide be stopped by the end of March.  . The announcement pushed the New Zealand dollar to a six-week low over concerns about the possible impact on the country, which depends on dairy products for about a quarter of its export earnings. . Trading in New Zealand’s dairy companies and futures was halted for a while following the second milk-safety scare to hit the country over a two-year period. . Police said no traces of the poison resembling salt crystals were found in any products in factories. The Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) also sought to assure consumers, saying the chances of contamination were extremely low. . “We are confident that New Zealand infant and other formula is just as safe today as it was before this threat was made. People should keep using it as they always have,” said MPI Deputy Director-General Scott Gallacher. . Security of production facilities and the supply chain had been increased, the police said. . “Whilst there is a possibility that this threat is a hoax, we must treat the threat seriously and a priority investigation is underway,” said Police Deputy Commissioner Mike Clement in a statement.  . He said no further letters had been received after the initial batch and the matter was being treated as blackmail rather than terrorism. . Fonterra, which controls nearly 90 percent of the country’s milk supply and collected roughly 14 billion liters of the liquid last year, said in-house tests conducted since January had not found any traces of the poison in its dairy products including infant formula powder. . “We can fully assure our customers and consumers that all of our milk and products are safe and of high quality, and our supply chain continues to be secure and world-class,” Fonterra CEO Theo Spierings said in a statement. . “We have taken immediate and decisive steps to give our customers and consumers added confidence - including increased testing and security measures.”     . The poison 1080 is extremely toxic and is used extensively in New Zealand, including in national parks and around the Milford Sound, one of the country’s biggest tourism draws, to control pests such as stoats, rabbits, deer, rats and possums.  . While these non-native species cause damage to the native flora and fauna, conservation groups have long criticized the use of 1080 because of the unintended impact on native wildlife, and there have been occasional protests against its use and unsuccessful campaigns to have it banned.    . The latest threat to the country’s dairy industry, which exported $11 billion in milk products in 2014, follows a contamination scare in 2013, when a botulism-causing bacteria was believed to be found in one of Fonterra’s products. . The incident prompted a recall of infant formula, sports drinks and other products in China, its biggest buyer, and other countries before the discovery was discovered to be false. . Dairy products make up more than 7 percent of New Zealand’s gross domestic product. . The New Zealand dollar fell on Tuesday to as low as $0.7278, its weakest since early February, following the announcement, and analysts were bracing for any economic fallout from the incident.   . “It’s just a threat and at this stage it hasn’t been carried out,” ANZ agricultural economist Con Williams said. . “It’s really the reputational issue given the sensitivity about food safety issues, and those things are impossible to quantify.” .

Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health researchers said on Monday they are targeting millions of smartphone users with Apple Inc’s new software tool, hoping to collect an unprecedented amount of data on major diseases by tracking their behaviors via iPhone. . The ResearchKit software tool, an open source platform, allows researchers to design applications that use built-in sensors on the iPhone along with data from other wearable devices to gather real-time health data. Scientists from Stanford University School of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College are among the first to offer apps for diseases like diabetes and heart disease. . For example, Massachusetts General Hospital’s GlucoSuccess app allows diabetics to participate in a research study that gives feedback on how their diet and exercise patterns impact daily glucose readings. It asks volunteers whether they have taken all of their medications or inspected their feet. . “It’s very hard in practice for people to carry out all the recommendations and stick with them over time,” said Dr. Stanley Shaw, co-director of the Center for Assessment Technology and Continuous Health at Massachusetts General. . Other apps released on Monday involve studies on asthma, breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease. For volunteers, the apps are designed to help people with chronic disease follow through with important health behaviors. . For researchers, the data improves upon the many pages of survey questions study volunteers had to fill out, often based on their recollection of what they ate in the prior week or how many minutes they put in at the gym. . Shaw said the fact that Apple made ResearchKit open source will allow “a whole host of medical researchers” to develop apps for their own research projects. . “We view this as the opening salvo,” he said. . The MyHeart Counts app will collect data about physical activity and cardiac risk factors for Stanford scientists studying heart disease. It allows users to complete tasks, such as performing a six-minute walk if they are able, and answer surveys from their iPhone, and provide them with an assessment of their heart health and information on how to improve it. . The app can tap into data gathered by other wearable gadgets such as Jawbone or Fitbit, but it can also be used with the iPhone, as long as people remember to keep their phones turned on, said Dr. Euan Ashley, chair of Stanford’s biomedical data science initiative. . Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, sees mobile health playing a major role in the president’s $215 million precision medicine initiative. . He anticipates tech companies will use large patient studies as a “test bed for a lot of the technologies they are developing.”  . “The Googles and the Apples and the Qualcomms are certainly paying close attention to the potential of this,” Collins said in a recent interview with Reuters. . Researchers say ResearchKit simplifies their recruiting work. Volunteers can decide how much data to share directly with the research institutions. “The data does not go to Apple,” Ashley said. . Dr. Eric Schadt, a genomics professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at New York’s Mount Sinai, used the platform to develop an asthma app along with Weill Cornell Medical College and LifeMap Solutions, a subsidiary of BioTime. . The fact that researchers can recruit, consent and enroll participants remotely should produce study sample sizes that are “orders of magnitude” greater than in the past at a fraction of the cost, Schadt said.  |Mon Mar 09 23:11:30 +0000 2015||Got diabetes?

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - The gap in suicide risk between young people in rural U.S. communities and those in more urban areas is widening, a new study suggests. . Possibly due to differences in mental health services, isolation, firearm access and economic factors, suicide is twice as common among young Americans in rural communities as in urban areas, the researchers write in JAMA Pediatrics.  . Previous studies found rural and urban difference, but what’s new here is that the differences are growing, said study leader Cynthia Fontanella, from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. . Fontanella and her colleagues say suicide is the third most common cause of death among people ages 10 to 24. It was listed as the cause of death for 66,595 people in that age group from 1996 through 2010. . For the new study, they looked suicides data for U.S. youths from 1996 through 2010. . Overall, for every 100,000 males ages 10 to 24, about 20 in rural areas committed suicide every year, compared to about 10 per year in urban areas.  . And for every 100,000 females in that age group, about 4 died by suicide each year in rural communities, compared to about 2 each year in more urban areas. . The researchers estimate that the rural-urban gap in suicide risk increased about 59 percent among males and 93 percent among females between 1996 - 1998 and 2008 - 2010. . The widening gap appears to be due to falling suicide rates in urban areas coupled with relatively stable suicide rates in rural communities, Fontanella said. . The gap in suicide risk persisted even after the researchers accounted for differences in healthcare access and social and economic traits. . Still, Fontanella said there may be residual problems in accessing mental health services in rural areas that could contribute to the gap, including lack of specialists and facilities. Also, stigma against metal health services is greater in rural areas, she said. . Other possible contributors to the increased suicide risk are economic hardship and isolation, the researchers write, adding that increased access to lethal methods of suicide may be a factor. . They say that while gun ownership is reportedly falling in urban communities, it remains relatively stable in rural areas. . They also found that in rural areas, suicide by firearm was about three times as common as in urban areas, and suicide by suffocation and hanging was about twice as common as in urban areas. . In an editorial, Dr. Frederick Rivara wrote that recent research suggests that trigger locks, gun lockboxes or safes can reduce the risk of suicide and unintentional injury by up to 70 percent. . Still, about 41 percent of U.S. adolescents report easy access to firearms, wrote Rivara, an editor of JAMA Pediatrics from the University of Washington in Seattle. . “Most concerning is that adolescents with a history of mental illness and those with a history of suicidality were as likely to report access to guns kept in the home as were those without such histories,” he added. . Fontanella and her colleagues suggest that integrating mental health services into primary care visits may improve access. Additionally, access to so-called telemedicine may allow people in rural areas to access mental health services through technology. . School education programs and the education of key community members about suicide may also help reduce suicide risk in rural areas, the researchers write. . They say safe storage campaigns or policies to reduce firearm access among young people in rural areas may be particularly effective in reducing suicides. . SOURCE: .  and .

|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned on Monday that Pfizer Inc’s quit-smoking drug, Chantix, has been associated with seizures and that some patients who drink while taking the drug may become aggressive or black out. . The agency said it approved an update to the drug’s label  in September but issued the public notice to ensure patients are aware of the changes “and can consider this new information when making prescribing decisions.” . Typically such warnings are made at the time of a label change. . Chantix, known chemically as varenicline, was approved in 2006. The FDA subsequently updated the label to include a warning, highlighted by a black box, of neuropsychiatric side effects, including suicidal thoughts, hostility and agitation. . Pfizer has asked the FDA to remove the black box, saying its own studies show no association between Chantix and severe psychiatric side effects. In October an FDA advisory committee recommended keeping the black box pending the outcome of an ongoing safety study. . Boxed warnings are reserved for the most serious of risks. . The FDA said on Monday it had examined a variety of studies, including analyses conducted by Pfizer. The studies had limitations that prevented the agency from drawing reliable conclusions. . The company is conducting an additional safety study of the drug, which generated $647 million in revenue in 2014. Results of the trial are expected in late 2015. The FDA said it is keeping the black box in place at least until the results of the trial are announced. |Mon Mar 09 20:38:15 +0000 2015||U.S. FDA declines to remove serious warning on Pfizer's Chantix |5.750328753026785e+17|http://reut.rs/1AXzWV2
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday released ResearchKit, an open-source software tool designed to give scientists a new way to gather information on patients by using their iPhones. . Several top research institutions have already developed applications to work on the ResearchKit platform, including those pursuing clinical studies on asthma, breast cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. They include Stanford University School of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College. . The format will allow users to decide if they want to participate in a study and decide how their data is to be shared with researchers. . “With hundreds of millions of iPhones in use around the world, we saw an opportunity for Apple to have an even greater impact by empowering people to participate in and contribute to medical research,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s senior vice president of Operations, said in a statement. . The ResearchKit platform is designed to work hand in hand with Apple’s HealthKit software, which allows iPhones to work with health and fitness apps that gather information on weight, blood pressure, glucose levels and asthma inhaler use. . The ResearchKit also allows researchers access to accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope and GPS sensors in the iPhone to gain insight into a patient’s gait, motor impairment, fitness, speech and memory. . The software is also designed to help researchers build more diverse study populations, which traditionally have been limited by physical proximity to large academic medical centers.  |Mon Mar 09 19:17:55 +0000 2015||Apple's ResearchKit to give scientists ready access to study subjects |5.7501265718870426e+17|http://reut.rs/1CWnlZ6
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Currently, a gluten free diet is the only way to manage celiac disease. But new drugs in clinical trials with humans, as well as more in the pre-clinical phase, may one day allow people with the disorder to enjoy gluten again. . These options are still years from commercial availability, but early results have been encouraging, according to a review of the drug pipeline in Gastroenterology Report. . “Based on data on ClinicalTrials.gov, there are two investigational products we are aware of which may enter large confirmatory trials in the not too distant future,” said lead author Dr. Klaus Gottlieb, senior medical director of the immunology and internal medicine department for Quintiles, a company that provides bio-pharmaceutical development services and consulting in Durham, North Carolina. . “One of them is an enzyme that splits the molecule in wheat that causes celiac disease, gluten, into smaller harmless products and another one promises to make the gut less leaky and thus prevent potentially toxic substances (from) reaching deeper layers where they may cause inflammation,” Gottlieb said.  . Two million Americans and 3.5 million Europeans have celiac disease, although more than half in the U.S. are not diagnosed, the authors say. People with the disorder must avoid eating gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley. If people with celiac disease consume foods that contain those grains, their immune response leads to intestinal damage, malnutrition and other problems. . Several new therapies have shown promise in human trials, appearing at least somewhat effective. None have yet entered safety trials, the final step before Food and Drug Administration approval and commercial availability. . It’s still hard to say when one of these options will reach the market, but if all goes well it could happen in three to five years, Gottlieb told Reuters Health by email. . For one potential oral therapy, patients take a mixture of two enzymes that split the gluten molecule into smaller harmless products. In a trial of adults with celiac disease, those taking this drug had no change in their intestinal biopsies after eating gluten, while those taking a placebo did have evidence of injury to the intestinal lining. . However, symptoms were similar in both groups. . Three daily doses of another drug, designed to control an inflammatory process in the intestines, did appear to reduce diarrhea, indigestion and abdominal pain symptoms in one trial. . Several others in earlier stages of development are aimed at suppressing the immune response to gluten and preventing intestinal inflammation. . Before the drugs are approved, it’s hard to say if they will allow people with celiac disease to eat gluten in small amounts, large amounts, or without restriction, Gottlieb said. . “If they eat a lot of gluten, they may still have some symptoms and perhaps other long-term health consequences,” he said. Some may be best to take right before eating gluten and others might be more effective when taken on a regular schedule. . SOURCE: .

Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - An injection for double chin reduction developed by Kythera Biopharmaceutical Inc was unanimously backed by an independent panel of experts on Monday, bringing the drug a step closer to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . Kythera’s stock has nearly tripled since it went public in 2012 as investors bet on what could be the first approved drug in the United States to reduce localized fat deposits. . The FDA typically accepts the panel’s recommendations. .  The drug, ATX-101, is a formulation of synthetically derived deoxycholic acid, which destroys fat under the chin, leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected. . Other injectables, such as Allergan Inc’s Botox and dermal fillers are normally used to smoothen areas of the face. .  Fat removal involves more radical procedures - limited to surgeries performed under general anesthesia and liposuction - and higher costs. . Submental, or below the chin, liposuction costs between $2,700-$5,175, according to the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery.  . Kythera has not revealed its pricing plans for the injection. .  Submental fat, known colloqially as a “double chin” can be caused by a plethora of factors including genetics and lifestyle, and can be resistant to diet and exercise.  . The drug is widely expected to win approval by May 13, when the FDA is scheduled to make its final decision. . Analysts estimate it will generate at least half a billion dollars in peak U.S. sales. . Makers of dermatologic and aesthetic drugs, including Nestle SA’s Galderma, Allergan Inc, and Johnson & Johnson will likely find ATX-101 attractive and could look to acquire rights to the drug or offer to buy the company, Cowen & Co’s Ken Cacciatore said in a client note. . Kythera’s stock was halted on Monday, but had jumped about 25 percent on Thursday when an FDA staff review concluded that the drug’s benefits outweighed its risks. . The stock closed at $53.13 on Friday.     .  The drug is also being reviewed by Canadian and Swiss regulators.       . Last year, Kythera regained rights to the market the drug outside the United States and Canada from a unit of Germany’s Bayer AG. . Westlake Village, California-based Kythera entered into separate license agreements last month with Actelion Ltd and the University of Pennsylvania to develop a potent approach to treat hair loss.

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Women with close male relatives with prostate cancer are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, a new study confirms. . These findings, from the large Women’s Health Initiative, reinforce the results of a 1994 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the authors write. . “This is not the first study to examine this relationship, but it is one of the larger to date, if not the largest study,” said lead author Jennifer L. Beebe-Dimmer of Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit. . Cancer is a disease of the DNA, she said, and family clustering indicates that breast and prostate cancers may have genes in common, . Beebe-Dimmer and her colleagues used data for more than 78,000 women in the Women’s Health Initiative who were over age 50 and cancer-free when the study began in 1993. At the start they had comprehensive physical exams and gave detailed personal and family medical histories. . Most women remained in the study for more than 10 years. . By 2009 there had been 3,506 new breast cancers in the original group.  . Overall, more than 11,000 women had a first-degree relative – mother, sister or daughter - with breast cancer, and this was more common for those who were eventually diagnosed themselves. Twenty percent of women with breast cancer had first-degree relatives with the disease, compared to nearly 15 percent of those who did not develop breast cancer. . There was a similar, but very slight, association with prostate cancer, the researchers reported in Cancer.  . More than 11 percent of women who developed breast cancer reported a first-degree relative with prostate cancer, compared to about 10 percent of women without the disease. Having a father, brother or son with prostate cancer increased the risk of breast cancer by about 14 percent. . Compared to women with no family history of breast or prostate cancer, those with a family history of both were 80 percent more likely to develop breast cancer, the authors found. . “We know that the major breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also linked to prostate cancer,” Beebe-Dimmer told Reuters Health by email. That may explain some of the clustering, she said. . Researchers have been reporting on familial links between breast and prostate cancer for 40 years, said Mary-Claire King of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, in email to Reuters Health.  . “It is good to see the link confirmed” in the Women’s Health Initiative, said King, who was not involved in the new research. . “Both of these cancers are relatively common, so that it is possible when cancers are diagnosed in multiple family members it may be due to chance,” she said. “It may also be an exposure to something in the environment.” . The decision to increase breast cancer screening will depend on how many male relatives have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and at what age, she said, with more diagnoses at young ages being particularly telling. . “Knowledge of breast cancer family history is still extremely important,” Beebe-Dimmer said. She would not recommend BRCA1 or 2 genetic testing for women with a family history of prostate cancer but no history of breast or ovarian cancer. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Letting patients see their medical records while they’re in the hospital might ease worry and confusion without extra work for doctors and nurses, a small study suggests.  . “The hope is that increased transparency achieved by sharing electronic medical records with patients while they’re in the hospital would make them more engaged in their care, more satisfied, and more likely to ask questions and catch errors,” said lead study author Dr. Jonathan Pell, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado in Denver.  . Patients didn’t think they could catch medical errors, “so that piece didn’t come out the way we had hoped it would,” Pell said. “But we were also pleasantly surprised that many of the doctors and nurses didn’t see their work load increased by patients having access to their records.” . These days patients more often have access to electronic medical records from checkups and outpatient treatments, but typically only after care is completed – and not for procedures while they’re in the hospital.  . To see what patients might learn from reviewing their medical records during their hospital stay, Pell and colleagues gave tablet computers to 50 people – all selected because they knew how to use the Internet. Most had a computer at home, and more than half had a laptop or smartphone with them in the hospital.  . About three in four earned $45,000 a year or less. Their average age was about 42. They were 34 percent male, 60 percent white, 22 percent black, and 6 percent Latino.  . Beforehand, 92 percent of patients thought reviewing the electronic charts would help them understand their medical condition and 80 percent expected this to help them comprehend doctors’ instructions. After reviewing their charts, these figures dropped to 82 percent and 60 percent, respectively. . But at the same time, patients feared that reading the records would make them more worried and confused, and this didn’t happen. Instead, the proportion of patients who were worried dropped to 18 percent from 42 percent, and confusion fell from 52 percent to 32 percent. . The researchers also asked 42 health care providers how they thought patients would respond to viewing the records.  . Before patients got the tablets, the 14 nurses surveyed thought they’d be asked to do more once patients saw their electronic records. But afterward, only half the nurses said this would result in them being asked to do more. . Out of the 28 doctors and other providers surveyed, 68 percent expected to be asked for more before patients saw the records, but only 36 percent did afterwards. . Clinicians and nurses were more optimistic than patients that sharing the charts would help patients spot medication errors, but this sentiment decreased significantly among all groups once the records were actually shared.  . While it only involved a few people at a single hospital, and included patients who appear to be early adopters of technology, it still has implications for how records might be shared with patients elsewhere, said Dr. Andrew Rosenberg, chief medical information officer at the University of Michigan Health System. . “It’s encouraging that this wasn’t a sample of all affluent, white men, because that suggests you may be able to try it with a broader population of patients,” said Rosenberg, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s also encouraging there doesn’t appear to be a major signal of harm for the patients and it didn’t create more work for the doctors and nurses.” . Still, including patients with less education or limited English may require more work to address health literacy issues, said Dr. Jonathan Darer, chief innovation officer for the division of clinical innovation at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania.  . While early adopters of technology and well educated people may have an easier time understanding their medical records, said Darer, who wasn’t involved in the study, many families “will struggle to read their records with any great understanding.”  .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - A plant-based diet may lower the risk of colorectal cancers, particularly if it includes seafood and fish, a large U.S. study finds. . Previous research suggests that vegetarians have a reduced risk of certain cancers, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. The current study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers fresh insight into the health benefits of different types of plant-based diets. . “We were surprised to find that pescovegetarians had a significantly lower risk of colorectal cancers than people on other vegetarian diets,” said lead study author Dr. Michael Orlich, an assistant professor in medicine and public health at Loma Linda University in California.  . Orlich and colleagues used dietary questionnaires, medical records, and cancer registries to examine the link between eating habits and cancer prevalence in a nationwide sample of 77,659 Seventh-Day Adventists, a religion that encourages a healthy lifestyle and abstinence from smoking and drinking.  . After an average follow-up of 7.3 years, there were 380 cases of colon cancer and 110 cases of rectal cancer. Overall, compared to regular meat eaters, the vegetarians were 22 percent less likely to have colorectal malignancies, the study found.  . Pescovegetarians, which the researchers defined as people who ate fish at least once a month and meat less than once a month, had the biggest risk reduction – 43 percent. . For lacto-ovo vegetarians, who consumed eggs and dairy while limiting fish and meat to less than once a month, the risk reduction was 18 percent. Vegans, who ate eggs, dairy, fish, and meat less than once a month, had a 16 percent risk reduction. . Even limiting fish and meat to once a week had some benefit; semi-vegetarians had an 8 percent risk reduction.  . “The comforting takeaway is that a person doesn’t need to be vegan and cut out all eggs, dairy, and fish to get some benefit in terms of reducing the risk of cancer,” said Dr. Leonard Saltz, chief of the gastrointestinal oncology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.  . According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately 4.7 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with colon and rectum cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2009-2011 data. . The new study isn’t conclusive, because it didn’t randomly select people to follow specific diets. Still, it offers more evidence in support of a diet often recommended for cancer prevention, said Saltz, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . “To the degree you can adjust your diet so it is primarily fruits and vegetables and seafood, it’s healthier,” Saltz said. “We’re not saying you’re committing suicide if you have a cheeseburger, but it should be a treat, not a regular occurrence.” . Several nutrients in fish may help protect against colorectal cancers, said Stacy Kennedy, a specialist in oncology nutrition at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  . Fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown in previous research to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of some types of cancer, said Kennedy, who wasn’t involved in the current study. . Many fatty fish are also a rich source of vitamin D, which has been shown to protect against colon cancer and other malignancies, she said.  . “Making small changes in your diet can be really helpful for cancer prevention,” Kennedy said. “For somebody already on a plant-based diet this study can help inform their choices about what to include in their meals, and for somebody who is eating more red meat this could encourage them to gradually cut back on that and add more fish and vegetables.” .

|PARIS (Reuters) - President Francois Hollande’s government announced on Monday a reform aimed at making it easier for low-earners to get access to a doctor, risking the ire of medics who complain the new funding arrangements will leave them out of pocket. . The standard current practice in France is to pay 23 euros up-front for a consultation and be reimbursed by the public health insurance fund later - an arrangement the Socialist government argues puts many low-earners off going to the doctor. . The reform makes it free for the patient at the point of use and requires the general practitioner to seek payment from the fund. Practitioners argue this will raise their administrative workload and lead to late payments for their services. . “The (arrangement) will be made available for everyone because it is fair and extends access to healthcare,” Health Minister Marisol Touraine told a news conference, adding that it would be in place by the end of 2017. . Touraine said the government would create a specific guarantee mechanism to ensure doctors were paid.  . Doctors across France have already staged lightning strikes against the measure and called a March 15 protest. |Mon Mar 09 13:30:25 +0000 2015||France pushes health reform despite medics' anger |5.7492520484305306e+17|http://reut.rs/1AVNOyR
Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - With spring just weeks away and as people begin training for upcoming marathons, research shows men and women are naturally conditioned to run the endurance races differently. . In a study published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, scientists who researched runners in 14 marathons found that women who tackle the 26.2-mile (42-km) race paced themselves more evenly than men. . But whether this reflects a difference in nature, nurture or a combination of the two remains an open question. . “We need to find out why women are pacing differently,” said Dr. Sandra Hunter, professor of exercise science at Marquette University in Milwaukee. “Is it the physiology, or is it a risk-taking psychology for the men?” . Hunter is one of several researchers who compared the sex differences in marathon pacing among 92,000 performances. While the extent varied, the sex difference in pacing occurred at all 14 marathons studied, the study showed. . Successful distance running requires appropriate and almost even pacing, so the findings suggest that women are superior to men in this way, Hunter said. . “The better runners tend not to slow dramatically,” she said. “Among the slower runners, the sex difference widens.” . One explanation is that men are naturally more competitive and risk-taking, going harder and slowing dramatically, Hunter said. But that theory ignores the physiological differences between the sexes. . “The best women will never outrun the best men,” she said.   . “Physiological differences explain that men will always be faster: Women have smaller hearts, more fat to carry, less hemoglobin, less muscle mass.” . Exercise physiologist and running coach Tom Holland tells his marathoners it is not who goes fastest, it is who slows down the least.  . Holland, author of “The Marathon Method,” preaches negative splits, or the strategy of running the second half of the race faster than the first. . “For the first eight to 10 miles (13-19 km) you have to run at an intensity that feels almost too easy, but for the average person, that takes a lot of discipline,” he said, adding he has seen many men hitting the wall at about mile 20 (32 km). . “As a racer I like to get behind women,” he said, “because historically they’re more even-paced.” . Hunter believes too much about exercise performance is based on men alone.   . “The assumption is that women respond the same,” she said. “Sometimes they do; sometimes they don’t.”  |Mon Mar 09 12:22:58 +0000 2015||For many marathon runners pacing may be a matter of gender |5.749082312581079e+17|http://reut.rs/1AVzFBQ
|GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN (Reuters) - A wearable device that stimulates the sense of balance with electric “noise” could help Parkinson’s disease patients, according to Swedish scientists. . Scientists from the University of Gothenburg’s Sahlgrenska Academy have developed a portable pocket-sized vestibular, or balance, stimulation device in a bid to improve the lives of Parkinson’s sufferers. . The research was led by Associate Professor Filip Bergquist, who said the simple device was similar to the TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy which is used for pain relief, for example in child birth. . “So this is really not a very complicated device. It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what’s called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything,” Bergquist explained. . The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located. . Parkinson’s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness. . Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson’s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia. . In earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals’ motor skills and balance. . The researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson’s patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients’ balance and the combined symptoms. . Parkinson’s sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier. . “I have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated,” he said. . Unfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom’s balance problems. . Bergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough. . He also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment. . “What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson’s disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said. . The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home. If those trials prove successful, the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years.|Mon Mar 09 12:22:57 +0000 2015||Electric 'noise' treats Parkinson's symptoms |5.7490822951747174e+17|http://reut.rs/1CUIAdP
|In South Africa’s scenic wine growing Western Cape, the Audacia winery wants to revolutionize the region’s famous industry after patenting a new technique that used Rooibos and Honeybush in the production of wine, beer and ciders. . With wine lovers globally looking for healthier ways to consume their favorite tipple, research conducted by the Department of Viticulture and Oenology at Stellenbosch University, found there were powerful antioxidants in Rooibos and Honeybush which may help preserve the wine naturally. . This method has the potential to eliminate the need for sulphur dioxide and other synthetic materials and preservatives. . Journalists were recently invited to sample the new Rooibos drinks at the Audacia wine farm in Stellenbosch. . Rooibos, a South African native tea, has been grown in the country for centuries. In the past decade, it has become popular with health-conscious consumers around the globe, leading to growing production and sales. . “Roughly half the rooibos crop is exported, the rest is consumed on the African continent of which the vast majority would be in South Africa. South Africa being the biggest rooibos consuming country in the world. If you look further afield Botswana has become a very strong market for rooibos. Zimbabwe also knows the product very well there are several brands in Zimbabwe, then if you look at what some of the supermarket chains are doing in Africa Nigeria for instance, rooibos typical South African brands are finding their way into those markets as well,” said Dawie De Villiers, managing director of cape natural tea Products. . The new Rooibos wine is the brainchild of wine farm owner Trevor Strydom who started experimenting with the process after drinking a cup of rooibos tea served by his daughter. . He and winemaker Michael van Niekerk put rooibos teabags in wine and found that it reduced the need for allergy-inducing sulphur and other common preservatives. . They now use the rooibos wood chips in the wine making process instead of the traditional oak. . “I see it being drunk all over the world, we registered the patent in 83 jurisdictions worldwide, we are already exporting the wine to China and it definitely will be drunk all over the world,” said Strydom. . Rooibos and honeybush wood are unique in that they contain no caffeine, low tannin levels making them ideal for use in wine, beer and cider as a natural preservative and flavoring product. . “It’s going to have definite effects on the global market because the market looks at competitors and especially not having to add sulphur ,there’s a huge advantage to the process and that changes the brand, it gives you a new brand that the health conscious world looks at so I’m pretty certain on the back of the rooibos brand that’s already around the world you will definitely see traction, but then even as a standalone product because its new its innovative it’s got a marketing edge and obviously if they do it cleverly they will get market share quite quickly,” said Alan Winde, minister of economic opportunities for the Western Cape government. . The Rooibos brand is internationally patented, making it a unique and typical South African product. . The plant is grown in the Cedarberg region of Clanwilliam and draws hundreds of tea lovers every year to the district. . In the Western Cape roughly 167,000 people are employed in the wine sector.|Mon Mar 09 12:22:57 +0000 2015||Rooibos wine targets health-conscious drinkers |5.749082278188196e+17|http://reut.rs/1AVzFBV
Vidya L Nathan|(Reuters) - CTI BioPharma Corp’s experimental blood cancer drug achieved the main goal of a late-stage study, but at least two analysts said the pill would not directly compete with Incyte Corp’s treatment. . The company’s shares shot up 10.9 percent in early morning trading, but were up only 4 percent at midday on the Nasdaq. . CTI BioPharma said on Monday its pacritinib significantly reduced the size of the spleen in patient’s suffering from myelofibrosis, a form of blood cancer that makes the bone marrow produce too much of any type of blood cell. . “... we could see pacritinib ultimately finding a niche in the (myelofibrosis) market among low platelet patients and perhaps taking incremental share away from Incyte,” Wells Fargo Securities analysts wrote in a note. . UBS Investment Research analysts also said CTI’s drug was not a direct threat to Incyte’s Jakafi, the only treatment for myelofibrosis to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . A second late-stage study would determine how well pacritinib would compete with Jakafi, Janney Montgomery Scott’s David Lebowitz said. . Jakafi, approved in November 2011, generated $357.6 million in revenue last year. Baxter International Inc bought the rights to sell pacritinib in November 2013. . Nearly 18,000 patients are estimated to live with myelofibrosis in the United States, CTI said. . The differentiating factor between the two drugs was that patients whose platelet counts went down, a condition called thrombocytopenia, responded to pacritinib. . CTI said its pill was significantly better than the “best available therapy” prescribed by patients’ doctors. The therapies, however, did not include JAK 2 inhibitors. . Jakafi and pacritinib belong to a class of cancer-fighting drugs called JAK inhibitors, which disrupt production of a protein key to regulating the immune system and contributes to the growth of cancer cells. . Pacritinib brought down spleen size by 35 percent, CTI said but did not disclose in how many patients. . Jakafi had achieved the same target in 45 percent patients in its late-stage study. |Mon Mar 09 11:51:22 +0000 2015||CTI BioPharma blood cancer drug meets main goal in trial |5.749002809212928e+17|http://reut.rs/1CUAMsk
Nicholas Vinocur|PARIS (Reuters) - France’s parliament will debate a bill on Tuesday allowing patients on the brink of death to stop treatment and enter a “deep sleep” until they die, a move some critics say amounts to euthanasia in disguise. . If passed, the legislation would give dying patients in the secular but traditionally Catholic country more power over their own treatment. It would also bolster Socialist President Francois Hollande’s image as a social reformer after a hotly contested move to legalize gay marriage in 2012. . Jean Leonetti, a center-right lawmaker and doctor who authored the law, told Reuters the bill would allow patients with “hours or days to live” to request to be placed under general anesthetic right through to the moment they die. . “The patient has to be at the end of their life and suffering despite the treatment given,” Leonetti said.  . “When these elements are present, I (the doctor) am obliged to start sedation that is deep and continues until death.” . Such a request would effectively let patients set their own death in motion, as the state of deep sleep is irreversible. But proponents say it stops short of assisted suicide and differs from euthanasia in that the time of death cannot be determined. . Currently, doctors in France can suspend treatment under some circumstances for patients who ask for it, provided they provide palliative care to reduce suffering, similar to other European countries. . In Europe only Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland allow euthanasia, with doctors actively assisting patients seeking death. In the United States, Oregon, Washington and Vermont allow doctor-assisted suicide.  . French law has evolved little since a 2005 reform setting out when doctors could decide to suspend treatment, despite Hollande voicing support for authorizing euthanasia during his 2012 presidential campaign. . But the debate returned to the fore last year with the case of Vincent Lambert, a young man who fell into a deep coma after a car crash and whose family members have clashed in French and European courts over whether or not treatment should be pursued. . “(Sedation) is not a universal response to suffering at the end of life,” said Stephane Mercier, head of the palliative care unit at Paul-Brousse hospital in Paris, adding that doctors were already equipped to ensure minimal suffering at the end of life. . But pro-euthanasia campaigners said the bill does not go far enough. . “Everyone says there is no suffering but nobody has ever been in that position (near death),” said Jean-Luc Romero, head of the Right to Die in Dignity association. |Mon Mar 09 11:35:47 +0000 2015||French parliament debates 'deep sleep' bill for end of life |5.74896356109738e+17|http://reut.rs/1AVpUU8
Michael Fleeman|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Doctors at a San Francisco hospital on Friday completed kidney transplant surgeries in a rare organ-transplant chain from living donors that resulted in healthy kidneys going to six sick people. . The group of 12 donors and recipients, ranging in age from 24 to 70-years-old, were recovering after their operations at California Pacific Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Dean Fryer. . “All the surgeries went smoothly. Everybody is now in their recovery rooms and getting some well-deserved rest,” Fryer said, adding that donors typically can be released in two to three days and recipients in three to five days. . The first round of operations began on Thursday and all the surgeries were completed by late Friday afternoon, Fryer said. Five surgeons and dozens of hospital staff were on hand for the two days of procedures, he said. . Among those recovering from Thursday’s surgery was Zully Broussard, 55, of Sacramento, California, a so-called altruistic donor who had triggered the domino effect. . Broussard, whose son and husband both died of cancer, offered to donate a kidney to a friend, but the friend ultimately had to use another donor, according to hospital officials. . Broussard was still willing to donate, so she was matched with a man she did not know from Benicia, California. That man’s sister-in-law, who was not a match for him, agreed to donate her kidney to a Fresno woman, while her son, in turn, would be a donor for another woman, and so on. . This was the largest kidney swap in the 44-year history of California Pacific’s transplant center. In 2011, the hospital became the state’s first to do a five-way swap, Fryer said. |Sat Mar 07 05:08:11 +0000 2015||Six-way kidney swap complete at San Francisco hospital |5.740740388233544e+17|http://reut.rs/1CKdR34
Julie Steenhuysen|LA JOLLA, Calif. (Reuters) - One of the earliest tasks in President Barack Obama’s $215 million “precision medicine” program will be finding a way to piece together data from a hodgepodge of existing studies, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. . Several providers already undertaking such studies have expressed interest in participating in the program, which will gather loads of health information and genetic data on more than 1 million Americans to develop targeted medicines, Collins told Reuters in an interview this week at the Future of Genomic Medicine conference in La Jolla, California. . Volunteers include Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic, the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin, Geisinger Health System and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.     . But before picking partners, NIH must figure out how to take medical records from different health systems and make them work together. . “That’s a high priority early on,” Collins said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean all of the data is in one place being operated by the same software,” he said. . But the software has to be transparent, and the data must be “exquisite,” Collins said. “That’s not easy.” . A large study of U.S. citizens has been in Collins’ sights since 2004, just a year after he successfully led an international team to sequence the first human genome as director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. . Collins said his 2004 proposal fell flat, but dramatic drops in the cost of genomic sequencing and the adoption of electronic medical records are making it feasible. . The goal of the project is to better understand the drivers of human disease and develop medicines targeted to an individual’s genetic makeup. . Collins is keenly interested in putting patients in charge of deciding how their data will be used. . “You want individual participants to have control over their data and have a dynamic opportunity to change the level at which they are willing to give access to possible research partners,” he said. . To sort out the details, Collins has designated NIH Deputy Director Kathy Hudson and Yale geneticist Dr. Richard Lifton to lead a panel to carry out the initiative.  . The panel will spend the next several months considering various proposals, and by September or October, Collins expects to have “a good sense of how we want to start this off.” |Sat Mar 07 01:36:59 +0000 2015||NIH director sees solving data puzzle as key to U.S. precision medicine |5.740208902597591e+17|http://reut.rs/1APkb2p
|(Reuters) - The Republican-controlled West Virginia legislature on Friday banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, overriding the governor’s veto and joining 11 other states in prohibiting abortion at that point. . The state Senate voted 27-5 to override the veto by Governor Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat. The state House of Delegates had voted to override his veto on Wednesday. . Tomblin had rejected the measure on Tuesday. He cited constitutional concerns since the bill barred termination of some pregnancies before the fetuses were viable. . A spokesman for Tomblin said the governor wanted the ban to target a later gestational period to ensure legality. The law takes effect on May 26. . Planned Parenthood said in a statement that bans on abortion after 20 weeks had been passed in 11 other states since 2010.   Idaho and Georgia have similar bans but they are not being enforced because they are undergoing legal challenges. . The reproductive health advocacy group said abortions after 20 weeks were rare and usually occurred due to maternal health risks. . Last year, eight abortions took place in West Virginia after 20 weeks, it said. |Fri Mar 06 23:40:05 +0000 2015||West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks over governor's veto |5.739914692892426e+17|http://reut.rs/1CJgXnS
Roxanne Nelson|Even if they haven’t been diagnosed with heart disease, diabetics with classical heart-risk factors like smoking and elevated “bad” cholesterol are at heightened risk of serious heart-related “events” and death, according to a new study. . Among people with diabetes but not heart disease, researchers linked more than a third of cardiovascular “events” - such as heart attack and stroke – and 7 percent of deaths to inadequate control of heart risk factors. . That means those cardiac events and deaths might have been avoided with better control of the known risk factors, the study team writes in Diabetes Care. . “The take home message from this study is that adults with diabetes can reduce their risk of cardiovascular events, and patients should work together with their provider to set a care plan including goals and strategies to reduce modifiable risk factors,” said lead author Gabriela Vazquez-Benitez, a research investigator at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  . “This can include regular care visits, screening, laboratory, weight, and blood pressure,” she told Reuter’s Health in an email. . The risk factors for cardiovascular problems in diabetes are well known and include high blood pressure, smoking and poor control of blood sugar. If more attention were paid to these risk factors, the rate of cardiovascular problems and death could be substantially reduced, the study team argues. . There are nearly 25 million Americans with diabetes and if current trends continue, more than one in three adults are projected to develop the disease.  . Stroke and coronary heart disease are the major causes of complications, deaths and healthcare costs in adults with diabetes, they write. . The authors point out that medical advances have improved the health of people with diabetes, especially when it comes to cardiovascular problems. But for people with diabetes as a group, the burden of cardiovascular problems remains very high. . In their study, Vaquez-Benitez and her team analyzed data on nearly 860,000 adults with diabetes.  . They looked at rates of major cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks and heart failure, as well as deaths from all causes, plus four risk factors: blood pressure, levels of LDL cholesterol, smoking and blood sugar levels over the months.  . The authors emphasize that overall rates of major cardiovascular complications and deaths were “substantially higher” in people with diabetes who already had heart disease, compared to those without it. . But delaying diabetes complications is possible, Vazquez-Benitez said, not only for cardiovascular events but for problems like nerve damage and kidney disease. . “Although there is a genetic component of diabetes, there are modifiable risk factors that can reduce risk of heart attack, stroke and death,” said Deborah Greenwood, a registered nurse and president of the American Association of Diabetes Educators. Lowering blood sugar, LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as quitting smoking can greatly reduce risk, she said.   . All adults over 45 should be screened for diabetes so it can be diagnosed and treated early, said Greenwood, who was not involved in the study. For most people with so-called pre-diabetes, she pointed out, losing 5 to 7 percent of body weight and doing 150 minutes of physical activity per week could avert progression to full-blown diabetes. . She also emphasized the importance of participating in diabetes self-management education and partnering with a credentialed diabetes educator to change behaviors and improve modifiable risk factors. “A diabetes educator will work with you to develop a plan specifically tailored to your individual needs, preferences and lifestyle to ensure success,” Greenwood said.  .

Kim Palmer|(Reuters) - Incoming students at Ohio State University’s Columbus campus will be required to provide proof of vaccinations for measles and a number of other communicable diseases starting in August, a school spokesman said on Friday. . Ohio State will continue to allow the roughly 12,000 new students to seek vaccination exemptions based on religious, medical or philosophical grounds similar to those in Ohio elementary and secondary schools, spokesman Gary Lewis said. . The university will require proof of vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and chicken pox, Lewis said. . All U.S. states require certain vaccines for students but at least 20 extend exemptions for a range of personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . A mumps outbreak at the university a year ago spread to outlying areas, reaching nearly 500 people. By comparison, Franklin County, which includes the university’s Columbus home, typically sees one reported mumps case a year. . The university’s policy change was made after consultations with federal, state, city and school experts, Lewis said. . Ohio does not require vaccinations to enroll in a university and vaccination reporting will not be required for returning students, students at satellite campuses or staff and faculty. . All students planning to live in campus housing will be required to provide proof of a meningitis vaccination, Lewis said. |Fri Mar 06 21:40:39 +0000 2015||Ohio State to require vaccinations for incoming students |5.739614127137751e+17|http://reut.rs/1AOVZwV
Lisa Rapaport|Stretches that work several muscle groups at once are great for upper-body warm-ups before a workout, an Australian study finds.  . Although athletes and coaches often swear by stretching, many common pre-workout routines may not actually enhance performance, said lead author Matt McCrary, a master’s degree candidate at the University of Sydney. . Higher load dynamic warm-ups are “the best bet” in most situations, said McCrary. For the upper body, these include push-ups, dumbbell back flys, and resisted lateral raises, he told Reuters Health by email. . Dynamic stretches focus on getting the blood flowing and increasing range of motion by using multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Unlike static stretches, which generally involve holding a single pose for a minute or two, dynamic stretches use a series of controlled movements. . To analyze the effect of upper body warm-ups, McCrary and colleagues reviewed findings from 31 past studies.  . The review, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, included 628 people playing sports at many levels, from youth leagues to college athletics and adults in recreational activities. Most studies involved sports where upper body strength is essential, such as baseball, football, tennis, golf, kayaking and shot put.  . The review found that high-intensity dynamic stretching improved strength and flexibility while delaying muscle soreness.  . But low-intensity stretching had little effect on performance, which agrees with previous research on upper body warm-ups, McCrary said.  . “Flexibility increases are generally unrelated to any type of performance improvements,” he noted.  . Heating and cooling during a warm-up also does little to improve performance, the study found. While applying heat to specific muscles before strenuous activity may minimize the loss of flexibility in the days following the workout, this practice didn’t show other benefits.  . And for baseball players, batting warm-ups didn’t work as well when bats were much lighter or heavier than those used during games.  . “This runs somewhat contradictory to the prevailing narrative that higher load warm-up is better than lower load warm-up,” McCrary said. “The two theories here are that warm-up swings with a heavier weight bat significantly and sub-optimally alter swing mechanics and/or that a resisted movement longer in duration than a baseball bat swing is necessary to produce a warm-up effect.” . While high intensity dynamic stretching can help elite and professional athletes, the same warm-ups may not be a good idea for more casual exercisers, said Dr. Kazuki Takizawa, an associate professor of sports training science and exercise physiology at Hokkaido University in Japan. . “Warm-up exercises may reduce injury by improving performance for serious athletes,” Takizawa said in an email. “But recreational athletes and weekend warriors are at a lower physical fitness level, especially in aerobic capacity, and they may fatigue by warm-up exercise and reduce performance.” . Takizawa also made a distinction between endurance sports like long-distance running or cycling and more intense activities done for shorter periods.  . “Short-term, high intensity exercises need vigorous warm-up,” Takizawa said. “But long-term endurance exercises do not.” . Because the study didn’t look specifically at injury prevention, it’s impossible to say for sure how intense dynamic stretching or other warm-ups might affect the risk for injuries, McCrary said.  . “We haven’t really zeroed in on what kinds of warm-ups best prevent injuries,” he said. “Anecdotally, I feel like warm-ups definitely do play a role in injury prevention, however, further study is required before I’d be able to confidently make any recommendations or explain how or why this is the case.” .

But for the approximately five million people with a gambling addiction, the next few weeks can present temptation, or torture.  . “It’s riskier than a lot of people think,” said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, sponsoring Problem Gambling Awareness Month, now underway. “The guy sitting down the hall could have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling. For him, this could be devastating.”  . The FBI estimates that more than $2.5 billion is wagered illegally each year on March Madness, a time in which calls to the Council’s helpline spike. “This has become a national gambling holiday,” Whyte said.  . According to sports analyst Danny Sheridan, the “Madness” of the tournament isn’t the basketball, but the bets. While the buy-in for small office pools may be only one or two hundred dollars, the cost to enter contests in Wall Street workplaces easily approaches seven figures. “It gets bigger and bigger each year,” Sheridan said. . But among many - primarily novice - gamblers entering the action, the first bets may trigger dangerous biological and psychological responses.  . “No one starts out to be a problem gambler. All gambling starts out recreationally,” Whyte said. In problem gamblers, he warns, wagering rewards the same pleasure pathways activated by illegal drugs.   . Tampa-based psychotherapist and certified gambling counselor Damon Dye points out that many who develop compulsive tendencies do so if they are feeling disconnected in personal relationships, isolated or bored. Employers can be challenged in identifying workers struggling, as problem gamblers are often skilled at hiding their addictions.  . “These are high-functioning, successful, respected people, who do very well financially and that we look up to,” Dye said. Among the most prone are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or who are comfortable with risk taking, and who have experienced some sort of “big win.” . For Arnie Wexler, that win was $54 at a racetrack when he was 17. His “chase” to replicate that one small success set off a decade and a half of gambling that eventually bankrupted his family. Wexler admits stealing from employers to pay off debts and wishing that either he or his family would die, so he wouldn’t have to tell them the truth.   . “I thought about killing myself every day, but I didn’t have enough guts,” said Wexler, now a certified gambling counselor and author of the newly-released autobiography, All Bets Are Off: Losers, Liars and Recovery from Gambling.  . “I would gamble on two cockroaches coming out of the carpet, which would come closer,” Wexler said. “That’s what a sick gambler does.”  . Sports betting consumed the Brooklyn native. “There were times when I had sex with my wife, and she would say, ‘I think I hear a ball game.’ But even though I would tell her she was crazy, I had a ball game on the transistor radio under her pillow.” . Wexler maintains that if he were still gambling, he would be in prison; with the availability of credit cards and ATMs, money is easier to come by.  . And this time of year, the circumstances are just too tempting, he said. Gamblers who are addicted, who haven’t gotten help yet, “will hear March Madness promotions and the odds and lines, and that juices them up,” he said.  . Social pressure is also at play, according to Dye. If a colleague doesn’t want to participate, don’t push.  . “For problem gamblers, the gambling urge is setting in, and they’re caught thinking they can’t say anything to get support, so they’re relying on strong will,” he said. “They go along with the bracket, because they don’t want to feel awkward.” |Fri Mar 06 20:01:37 +0000 2015||March Madness ‘gambling holiday’ risky for compulsive gamblers |5.739364903859487e+17|http://reut.rs/1CIstzW
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Friday approved Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc’s drug for the treatment of two rare, often fatal invasive fungal infections that target patients with blood cancers. . The Food and Drug Administration approved sale of the anti-fungal drug, Cresemba, for use against invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. . The approval had been expected after an expert advisory panel to the FDA in January voted 11-0 that Astellas had demonstrated sufficient safety and efficacy to support Cresemba for aspergillosis and 8-2 for mucormycosis. The panel cited the need for additional treatments. . In clinical trials, the drug, also known as isavuconazonium, proved at least as safe and effective in reducing mortality as voriconazole, which Pfizer sells under the brand name Vfend, the current standard of care for aspergillosis. . “Today’s approval provides a new treatment option for patients with serious fungal infections and underscores the importance of having available safe and effective antifungal drugs,” Edward Cox, head of evaluation of antimicrobial products for the FDA, said in a statement. . Cresemba received a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation from the agency, which is used as an incentive to spur development of antibacterial or antifungal drugs that treat serious or life-threatening infections. The designation comes with an additional five years of marketing exclusivity. . Astellas expects to begin selling the drug “in the coming months,” said Jim Robinson, head of the company’s U.S. operations. . Invasive aspergillosis is a rare, life-threatening fungal infection seen predominantly in patients with compromised immune systems, such as those with leukemia. Mucormycosis is a very rare, rapidly progressing invasive fungal infection also with high rates of morbidity and mortality. . Cresemba is also being tested against another serious fugal infection called invasive candidiasis, Robinson said. That would address a larger patient population than the two infections in the initial approval.   |Fri Mar 06 19:45:56 +0000 2015||U.S. FDA approves Astellas drug for invasive fungal infections |5.739325460750008e+17|http://reut.rs/1AOGYve
Janice Neumann|After giving birth, women often struggle with reduced sexual desire and arousal, but how they delivered – by cesarean or vaginally – is not to blame, a small study suggests. . Women in the study were just as likely to report sexual problems 12 weeks after delivery, regardless of how they gave birth, although complaints did differ somewhat between the C-section and vaginal-delivery groups. . “The message for pregnant women is that sexual dysfunction in some aspects or domains is expected and is not permanent,” said senior author Dr. Taymour Mostafa, a professor of andrology and sexology at Cairo University in Egypt. . Pregnancy and delivery can cause physical changes that often cause pain during sex, reduced desire, difficulty achieving orgasm and fatigue, Mostafa and his colleagues write in the International Journal of Impotence Research.  . Many women with these problems don’t ask for help from doctors, even though they want to, the authors note. . The researchers surveyed 200 women six weeks after giving birth, and again at 12 weeks. The average age was 25 to 30; most were highly educated and living in urban areas. Forty-five percent delivered vaginally; 55 percent had a C-section.   . Six weeks after delivery, 43 percent of the women noticed a difference in sex, with 70 percent feeling pain and 30 percent fatigue. By 12 weeks, however, 38 percent said their sex lives were improved because of more intimacy and less pain. . Overall, the risk of problems was similar for both delivery modes. But those who delivered vaginally felt much less desire, arousal and lubrication than the C-section group, though not much difference in ability to have an orgasm, satisfaction or pain. The women who had a C-section only noticed a significant difference in their level of desire after 12 weeks. . “Many women are afraid (to resume sexual intercourse), so I think fear plays into that part of desire,” said Sandi Tenfelde, a women’s health nurse practitioner and researcher at the Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, Loyola University Chicago.   . “If you are concerned about the changes that happen in your body and you’re nervous about what it’s going to feel like, that fear can reduce the desire,” she said. . “Women can also have pelvic pain or perineal (between vagina and rectum) pain, depending on their mode of giving birth, that may also impact not only their desire but their arousal,” Tenfelde said. . Tenfelde praised the researchers for doing a study on a subject that needed more answers. . Women who return for their six-week postpartum check “are reassured that everything is normal and healing, but many women recognize that their body has changed during pregnancy and after birth and they are wondering how they will recover from the physical changes that happen with pregnancy and birth,” she told Reuters Health. 	 . “Until we can start asking those questions, it’s hard for us to give that anticipatory guidance to help women recover and heal and understand what is expected,” Tenfelde said. . Mostafa and colleagues say the new father’s state of mind can also affect sex after giving birth. . “The role of the male partner is highly important for good understanding of these changes, support, encouragement and avoiding criticisms,” Mostafa told Reuters Health. . Tenfelde said couples could have a “desire discrepancy,” where the typical six weeks of waiting for sex after a birth was long and frustrating for a partner but a woman still felt apprehensive. But, Tenfelde said, couples could find other ways to be intimate. . “There are lots of ways to be intimate with your partner after the birth of a baby (hand holding, cuddling, massage and genital stimulation without vaginal penetration). Finding alternate ways of being intimate without vaginal penetration can be very therapeutic for the couple,” Tenfelde said. . SOURCE: .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Getting too little sleep is linked to poor health, but short naps might partly offset that effect, a small study suggests. . Sleep deprivation can have a negative impact on brain function, metabolism, hormones and the immune system. While research has shown that a 30-minute afternoon nap can restore alertness, the current study is the first to examine whether napping has any impact on stress or immune system function, said Brice Faraut, a sleep researcher at Université Paris Descartes-Sorbonne Paris Cité in France.   . Faraut and colleagues studied 11 healthy young men who typically slept seven to nine hours each night, didn’t smoke and didn’t normally take naps.  . Two separate times, each man participated in a three-day session of sleep tests in a laboratory where food intake and lighting were strictly controlled and no alcohol, caffeine or medications were allowed.  . During one session, they slept normally for one night but then were only allowed to sleep for two hours the next night. The men could sleep as much as they liked on the third night.  . The other session was the same - except the men were allowed to take two 30-minute naps the day after their sleep was restricted.  . The study team collected urine and saliva samples each day to measure levels of norepinephrine, a substance that’s typically released when the body is under stress. It increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure and blood sugar. . The men’s norepinephrine levels were more than doubled in the afternoon after the night of sleep restriction, compared to the day after they had slept normally. But there was no change in norepinephrine when participants were allowed to nap.  . Lack of sleep also affected an immune-regulating molecule called interleukin-6, which dropped when the men were sleep-deprived but stayed normal when they were allowed to nap.  . This relatively short nap duration can be a “powerful countermeasure to sleep debt,” Faraut said in an email, adding that the findings need to be tested in real-life situations. . Michael Grandner, a sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the study, said the immune findings were somewhat contradictory to the existing literature.   . “But these are complicated processes, and studies like these, that examine what happens during partial recovery, (help) us understand all of the ways that sleep is important for health and functioning,” Grandner told Reuters Health by email.  . Grandner differentiates between two types of napping. . “First are naps that you take because you are so exhausted that you cannot stay awake,” Grandner said. “A nap in this case may help a little, but being that exhausted is a sign of insufficient sleep or a sleep disorder and it’s unlikely that the nap can completely fix the problem.”  . “You might have a sleep disorder like sleep apnea (which is a very common cause of sleepiness) or you may be sleep deprived,” he said, “which has been shown to be an important risk factor for weight gain and obesity, heart disease, poor performance, and many other outcomes.” . Grandner said the second type of nap is one you take to refresh yourself.  . “Rather than a nap by necessity, this is a nap by choice,” he said. “These naps, since they are not in the context of exhaustion, have the opportunity of boosting your performance (rather than simply making up for lost sleep).”  .

|LONDON (Reuters) - A sprinter from Sierra Leone, who disappeared after competing in last year’s Commonwealth Games, has been sleeping rough in London, afraid to return home because of the Ebola virus, the Guardian reported on Friday.  . Jimmy Thoronka raced in the 4x100 meters relay in Glasgow but disappeared at the end of the competition in August. . He failed to return to Sierra Leone after discovering that several members of his family had been killed by the deadly virus.  . “I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola,” he was quoted as saying.   . “I couldn’t stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on... . “I wanted to go to London for a while after the Games but my bag with my money and passport in it was stolen at Glasgow station.  . “I was scared to go to the police in case they arrested me and put me in a cell so I begged someone at the station to pay my fare to London and they agreed to do that.” . While watching an African TV channel, Thoronka discovered that his mother had also died of Ebola and later found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by the virus. . He now sleeps in parks and on night buses while begging for money to buy food.  . “We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England,” he said. . “Some days I don’t think I’m going to make it and just feel like killing myself. . “My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don’t see how that can happen now... . “I’m very frightened of what will happen to me. Life here is very bad for me but if I return to Sierra Leone I don’t think I will make it.” . Ebola has killed nearly 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea during a year-long epidemic.  . The virus is still widespread in Sierra Leone, which recorded 81 new cases in the week to March 1, including 26 in the capital Freetown. |Fri Mar 06 14:35:18 +0000 2015||Missing sprinter from Sierra Leone sleeping rough in London |5.738543703637975e+17|http://reut.rs/1AO4sR7
Deena Beasley|(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday gave a green light to sales of the country’s first “biosimilar,” or copied version of a biotechnology drug, by approving Novartis’ white blood cell-boosting Zarxio. . The drug contains the same active ingredient as Amgen Inc’s  Neupogen, or filgrastim, which generated 2014 sales of $1.2 billion worldwide. . The Food and Drug Administration said it approved Zarxio for  the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used - preventing infections in cancer patients undergoing various treatments. . The move had been expected after Zarxio, which is made by Novartis’ Sandoz generics unit, won unanimous backing from an FDA panel in January. . Biosimilars have been available in Europe since 2006. Health insurers have said biotech drugs with expired patents should also face lower-cost competition in the United States, leading to savings in the same way generic versions of conventional medicines have cut prescription costs. . The FDA, however, only received the authority to approve biosimilars with the passing of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in 2010. . Biological medicines, whose price tags can run into tens of thousands of dollars per patient per year, account for about 30 percent of U.S. drug spending. . Unlike chemical compounds, such as aspirin or statins, biotech drugs are made inside living cells, and tiny variations are inevitable, depending on the exact production process. As a result, a copycat version can only ever be similar to the original, rather than identical. . One technical uncertainty with a biosimilar is its official generic name, an important point for pharmacists filling prescriptions. The FDA said Zarxio would, for now, carry the hyphenated name “filgrastim-sndz” while the agency works on a comprehensive naming policy. . In a statement, Amgen said it believed Neupogen, with a wholesale price of $315 for the lowest packaged daily dose,  “continues to have an important role to play in helping patients.”  . Sandoz declined to specify Zarxio’s pricing ahead of the U.S. introduction. “The only thing we can say is it will be competitively priced,” Carol Lynch, global head of biopharmaceuticals and oncology injectables, told Reuters.  . Amgen has sued to block Zarxio. Sandoz previously agreed to delay its U.S. launch until a court decision on Amgen’s request for a preliminary injunction, or until April 10, whichever comes first. A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for March 13. |Fri Mar 06 14:35:17 +0000 2015||Novartis wins approval for first U.S. biosimilar drug |5.738543686314967e+17|http://reut.rs/1CH5W6w
|(Reuters) - Eli Lilly has lost a patent case in Germany over its blockbuster Alimta lung cancer drug to generic producer Actavis, hitting the U.S. drugmaker’s future sales hopes for the medicine. . Alimta generated worldwide sales of $2.79 billion for Lilly last year, making the medicine its biggest-selling product. . The German appeal court ruled that Actavis would not infringe patents held by Lilly if it marketed an alternative salt form of the drug, known generically as pemetrexed, once the compound patent expires in December 2015. . The ruling contradicts a previous verdict by a lower court in Germany and Lilly’s general counsel, Michael Harrington, said the company would fight the decision. . “We will seek permission to appeal this ruling to the German Supreme Court,” Harrington said in a statement on Friday. . Lilly contends that Alimta should continue to enjoy exclusivity to June 2021 because of patents covering a vitamin regimen that is used with the drug. These patents relate to the administration of folic acid and vitamin B12 to patients before and while they receive Alimta to prevent side effects. . Lilly suffered a similar setback in the English High Court last May. . In that case the English court gave corresponding declarations of non-infringement regarding Alimta’s vitamin regimen patents in France, Italy and Spain, the first example of such foreign jurisdiction for a European patent.  |Fri Mar 06 14:03:45 +0000 2015||Eli Lilly loses Alimta drug patent case in Germany to Actavis |5.7384642958997914e+17|http://reut.rs/1CGX2Gh
Maria Caspani|NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Diseases spread through dirty water and poor sanitation are the fifth biggest killer of women worldwide, causing more deaths than AIDS, diabetes or breast cancer, researchers say.  . Nearly 800,000 women die every year because they lack access to safe toilets and clean water, said the development organization WaterAid, which analyzed data from the Seattle-based Institute of Health Metrics research center. . “This completely unacceptable situation affects women and girls’ education, their health, their dignity and ultimately, in too many cases, results in an early and needless death,” WaterAid CEO Barbara Frost said in a statement. . The only conditions more fatal for women than the lack of decent sanitation are heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the report. . More than 1 billion women, or one in three women around the world, do not have access to a safe, private toilet, while 370 million - one in 10 - do not have access to clean water, according to WaterAid. . More than 2 billion people gained access to clean water between 1990 and 2012, but nearly 750 million remain still lack what the United Nations recognizes as a human right. . Dirty water and poor sanitation are at the root of problems such as maternal and child mortality, and sexual violence.  . Many women in developing countries give birth at home without access to clean water, exposing themselves and their babies to infections. . Without safe toilets, women and girls have to venture outdoors to relieve themselves, often at night, putting them at risk of sexual harassment and assault. . Moreover, in many poor countries fetching water is considered a the responsibility of women and girls, who spend hours each day trekking to and from wells, keeping them from attending school or caring for their families. |Fri Mar 06 05:21:15 +0000 2015||What kills more women than AIDS and breast cancer?

Nathan Layne|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp is working toward eliminating the sale of chicken and meat from other animals raised with antibiotics that are vital to fighting human infections, senior executives at the third-largest U.S. retailer told Reuters on Thursday. . The ongoing push by Costco, which sells 80 million rotisserie chickens a year, highlights growing pressure on the supply chain in the wake of this week’s announcement by fast-food giant McDonald’s Corp that it would stop buying chicken raised with so-called “shared-use” antibiotics within two years.  . “We are working towards, and working with our suppliers and the regulatory agencies... to see how we can get rid of shared-use antibiotics in animals,” Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety at the Issaquah, Washington-based retail giant, said in a phone interview. . “I think all of us want to move to a point where we can get the human-use antibiotics out of the system. It’s going to take time.” . Wilson and Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said the company did not have a target date for reaching that goal, a reflection of supply constraints. . Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the rate of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. . Scientists and public health experts say whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and can enable the strongest to survive and multiply. Frequent use of low-dose antibiotics, a practice used by some meat producers, can amplify that effect. The risk is that so-called superbugs might develop cross-resistance to medically important antibiotics. . “I mean, you’ve got to protect human health beyond everything, and so we think eliminating shared-use antibiotics is the right way to go,” Wilson said. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued voluntary guidelines to regulate antibiotic use by producers of poultry and other livestock. Antibiotics rated medically important by the FDA for growth promotion are scheduled to be phased out by December 2016. . Wilson said Costco has been working with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the goal of eliminating shared-use antibiotics. The Center for Veterinary Medicine is involved in the effort as well, he said. . Over the years Costco has grown into one of the largest retailers of food. Fresh food, including meat, produce, deli and bakery items, accounted for 13 percent of its $110 billion in net sales in the last fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2014.  |Fri Mar 06 00:42:19 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Costco working to end use of human antibiotics in chicken |5.7364474535807386e+17|http://reut.rs/1AMDOIh
|(Reuters) - A federal investigator who tested positive for a deadly bacteria that affected five monkeys at a Louisiana primate research facility did not contact it while she was at the lab, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. . The worker likely became exposed to the bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, during previous travels to parts of the world where the bacteria is endemic, Jason McDonald, a spokesman at the CDC, told Reuters.  . Five monkeys at the high-security Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans were accidentally infected with or exposed to the bacteria late last year.  . Three of them had to be euthanized. The other two showed antibodies that indicated they had been exposed but never had any symptoms, Tulane officials said.  . The rhesus macaque monkeys had been housed in the veterinary clinic of the center, about 40 miles north of New Orleans. Research on the bacteria, which was being done to find a vaccine, has been halted while investigators determine how the bacteria escaped from its confines in the lab, Tulane spokesman Mike Strecker said.  . The clinic, which has been decontaminated, is believed to be where the monkeys contacted the bacteria while they were being treated for routine illnesses and injuries suffered in their breeding colony. . Lab workers, veterinary staff and other personnel have tested negative for the bacteria, CDC officials said earlier this week. . The bacteria can cause a disease called melioidosis in both humans and animals. It has a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other diseases like tuberculosis or pneumonia, according to the CDC. . In late January, the investigator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture became sick after having visited the center, and an antibody test indicated she had been exposed to the bacteria, Strecker said. . But testing this week showed her antibody levels had not grown since her visit to the clinic, MacDonald said. That indicated the exposure was an old one, he said, and occurred before her investigation at the center.  . CDC officials did not identify the country in which the investigator had been traveling, but said the bacteria was endemic in regions including Southeast Asia and Australia. |Thu Mar 05 23:10:16 +0000 2015||Inspector testing positive for deadly bacteria didn't get it at Louisiana lab: CDC |5.736215771132723e+17|http://reut.rs/1AMw0Gr
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Many Americans would not have quick access to the best healthcare options during a stroke, even under the most ideal circumstances, according to a new computer model. . In a hypothetical model, if each state had up to 20 hospitals providing the best possible care for people having strokes - which is not the current reality - more than a third of Americans would still be more than a 60-minute ambulance ride away from one of those medical centers. . Using a helicopter or other air transportation would improve that number but still leave many Americans more than an hour away from the nearest center, the study found. . “There are effective treatments for stroke, but they are time sensitive,” said lead author Dr. Michael Mullen. “The faster a patient is treated, the more likely they are to be eligible for acute stroke therapies and the more effective those therapies will be.” . Timely transport to a qualified medical center is especially important with recent evidence supporting a new method to clear stroke-causing blood clots from the brain, said Mullen, a neurologist from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, in an email to Reuters Health. . That procedure, he said, “is resource intensive and will not be available in all hospitals.” . Starting in 2003, medical centers could be certified as primary stroke centers, making them go-to hospitals for stroke patients. Starting in 2012, they could also be certified as comprehensive stroke centers to show they deliver the most advanced stroke care. . For the new study, the researchers used a computer model to show which primary stroke centers should be upgraded to comprehensive centers to optimize access for as many Americans as possible. . By the end of 2010, there were 811 primary stroke centers that were potential candidates for upgrade, the researchers report in the journal Neurology.  . Each state had between 0 and 96 primary stroke centers, and only about 66 percent of Americans were within a one-hour ride to one of those centers, they found. . Under what the researchers consider a best-case scenario, converting up to 20 of those hospitals in strategic locations in each state would give about 63 percent of Americans access to a comprehensive stroke center within an hour drive. . By adding air transportation as an option to those centers, 86 percent of Americans would be an hour away from one of the comprehensive stroke centers. . Even so, access would vary considerably by state. Everyone in most Northeastern states would have access to a comprehensive stroke center by ground or air within 60 minutes, compared to only about 15 percent of people in Wyoming. . “I think that the primary take-away is that even under optimal circumstances Comprehensive Stroke Centers may not be rapidly accessible to everyone in the population and there will likely be significant geographic variability in access to these centers,” Mullen said. . The researchers caution that comprehensive stroke centers are new and still need to show that they deliver better care than traditional hospitals. . One neurologist not involved with the study said the current approach to stroke care has elements in common with approaches used in trauma care and for heart attacks.  . For heart attacks, Dr. David Miller said, many hospitals can provide initial care and then transfer patients to other hospitals - but trauma patients are usually taken directly to regional centers that provide very advanced care. . “Stroke is in-between,” said Miller, director of the comprehensive stroke center at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. . As of now, he said, the most important thing is for people experiencing the symptoms of stroke to get medical attention and notify 911. . “If it’s a small emergency room that’s a block away, you get them there,” Miller said. . The American Stroke Association recommends FAST to identify the symptoms of a stroke: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911. . SOURCE: .  and .

Jessica Dye|(Reuters) - A California jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc unit to pay $5.7 million in the first trial over injuries blamed on the TVT Abbrevo, one of numerous transvaginal mesh products that are the subject of thousands of lawsuits.   . Following more than three days of deliberations in Kern County, California, jurors found Ethicon liable for problems with the TVT Abbrevo’s design and for failing to warn about its risks, according to a lawyer for plaintiff Coleen Perry.  . Perry was awarded $700,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $5 million in punitive damages after jurors in the Bakersfield court found Ethicon’s conduct amounted to “malice,” her lawyer said.  . The verdict is the fourth win for plaintiffs suing Ethicon over transvaginal mesh. More than 36,000 lawsuits have been filed against Ethicon in state and federal courts over the devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.  . The Abbrevo, one of Ethicon’s newer models of mesh products, was cleared for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010 to treat stress urinary incontinence. Perry, who was implanted with it in 2011, said she began experiencing a “pulling-type” pain almost immediately after surgery.  . Perry said the mesh began to erode in her body, causing pain that she said she expects to last the rest of her life, according to testimony Reuters saw on Courtroom View Network.  . Ethicon’s lawyers said the product was thoroughly vetted before it hit the market and that doctors considered the mesh used in the Abbrevo to be the “gold standard” for incontinence treatment.  . Peter de la Cerda, a lawyer for Perry, said the verdict sent a “clear message to Ethicon” about its “improper conduct in designing and marketing the Abbrevo.”  . Ethicon spokesman Matthew Johnson said the company believed it has strong grounds for appeal. Ethicon stands behind the safety and effectiveness of the Abbrevo, as well as its development and marketing, he added.  . Ethicon won one trial over mesh in federal court in West Virginia, where another trial over its mesh products started on Monday.  . Ethicon, Boston Scientific Corp and C.R.

Julie Steenhuysen|LA JOLLA, Calif. (Reuters) - A new genetic test that sequences the blood of pregnant women for signs of diseases such as Down Syndrome in their fetuses are turning up unexpected results: a diagnosis of cancer in the mother. . In as many as 40 cases, women who took Sequenom Inc’s MaterniT21 test, which scans their genetic code and that of their fetus, had abnormal changes that could signify cancer. In at least 26 of these women, that test turned out to be accurate. . Such tests from Sequenom and other companies, sequence the mother’s blood, which includes both the mother’s DNA and fetal DNA from the placenta. The unintended detection of disease lends weight to the idea that some cancers can be traced through non-invasive tests, when tumors shed their DNA into the bloodstream. . Dr. Eunice Lee, 40, a San Francisco anesthesiologist, was one of those women.  . Speaking at the Scripps Future of Genomic Medicine Conference, Lee said she was hoping for a normal result for her baby. Instead, Sequenom advised her to seek cancer screening. A full body MRI identified a large tumor in her colon, which doctors removed in the 15th week of her pregnancy. . Sequenom’s chief scientific officer, Dr. Dirk van den Boom, said the company is gathering data on the other women whose tests indicated abnormalities. So far, he said he is not aware of any false positive results. . Other researchers have had similar findings. Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium developed a blood test for signs of Hodgkin’s lymphoma after detecting the illness in pregnant women. . Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts University said the noninvasive prenatal tests represent the “biggest clinical implementation of genomic medicine to date,” with more than 1 million having been performed since 2011. Other companies offering such tests include Illumina, privately held Natera and Ariosa Diagnostics, acquired by Roche in December. . Most often, DNA from the mother comes from bone marrow, but if she has cancer, it may also be coming from her tumor. . Such results are raising ethical concerns. Lee said she was not told that the test might identify a cancer. Van den Boom said the company has struggled about what to do with such results, but favors disclosing the information.  . Bianchi said there is “pressing need” for guidance on how to disclose unforseen findings discovered by prenatal tests, noting that there no professional guidelines on how to deal with them. |Thu Mar 05 21:23:59 +0000 2015||Prenatal blood tests detect cancer signal in some women |5.7359483176055194e+17|http://reut.rs/1CDj10C
Michael Fleeman|(Reuters) - Doctors at a San Francisco hospital began an unusual series of kidney transplants on Thursday with six living donors providing organs to six patients in a chain that began with a woman  described as an altruistic donor unrelated to any of the recipients. . The first donor and recipient went into surgery at California Pacific Medical Center at 7:30 a.m., with two more donor-recipient pairs on the schedule for Thursday, then the remaining three pairs on Friday, hospital spokesman Dean Fryer said. . The chain of donations began when Zully Broussard, 55, of Sacramento, whose son and husband both died of cancer, offered to donate a kidney to a friend, but the friend ultimately had to use another donor, according to hospital officials. . Still willing to donate, even to a stranger, Broussard was matched with a man from Benicia, California, triggering a domino effect. That man’s sister-in-law, who was not a match for him, agreed to donate her kidney to a Fresno woman, while her son, in turn, would be a donor for another woman, and on it went. . “I’m excited, not nervous,” Broussard told San Francisco’s KNTV news on the eve of surgery. “I know there’s going to be a life out there that’s extended. I feel like there is a higher power behind all this, making it happen. I didn’t realize it was so huge. I’m just a small part of the chain.” . The six-way transplant involving a dozen people is the largest kidney swap in the 44-year history of California Pacific’s transplant center. In 2011, the hospital became the state’s first to do a five-way swap, Fryer said.  . “It is just amazing that we’re able to create this large of a chain within a single hospital,” Fryer said. “You’ve got six people who now have a second chance at life.” |Thu Mar 05 19:49:39 +0000 2015||San Francisco hospital begins rare six-way kidney transplant chain |5.735710934804726e+17|http://reut.rs/1CCVP2v
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Based on a new analysis, the health benefits of having a drink a day may be exaggerated, UK researchers say.  . Only women over age 65, if anyone, might get a protective effect from light drinking, compared to people who never drank,  the study found. . Much past research has shown that people who drink a low to moderate amount of alcohol – about one drink per day – fare better than both heavy drinkers and those who abstain completely. . But that non-drinker comparison group may be skewing the results, according the new study’s lead author Craig S. Knott of the department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London. . People who used to drink but don’t anymore, for whatever reason, tend to be less healthy and more likely to die than others, he told Reuters Health by email. . “With existing research having largely grouped former and never drinkers together, there was the possibility that reductions in risk among lighter drinkers may be partly due to their comparison against people who are simply less healthy,” he said.  . And people who have never had alcohol may have other health conditions that make drinking unsafe and make them less healthy than others, he noted.  . When he and his coauthors left out former drinkers and compared light, moderate and heavy drinkers to those who only occasionally drank, the apparent benefits of drinking disappeared almost entirely. . They used annual, nationally-representative surveys of English adults age 50 or older collected from 1994 to 2008 and including a total of more than 45,000 people. At each survey, the participants reported how often they consumed alcohol during an average week and how much they drank on the heaviest drinking day of a typical week. . As other studies have found, currently drinking alcohol was associated with a lower risk of death in almost all age groups and levels of drinking compared to people who were not current drinkers, based on a linked database of deaths in England.  . But when the researchers excluded those who used to indulge but had given it up, the apparent protective effect remained only for men between ages 50 and 65 and women over age 65. Protection was minimal for the men and only applied to those who drank at least seven pints of beer in an average week. It was broader, but still low, for the women, the authors write in BMJ. . Some other studies have in fact found the opposite, that alcohol in moderation is more effective for men than women, according to Dr. Giovanni de Gaetano of the University of Milan in Italy, who was not involved in the new study.  . “Relative to occasional drinkers, there was little to no indication that regular light consumption may actually be of benefit in any age-sex group, at least in terms of mortality risk,” Knott said.  . Any reductions in risk that remained after the study team adjusted for personal, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, and left out the former drinkers, could still be the result of other biases in group selection, inaccurate alcohol reporting or residual factors that haven’t been accounted for, Knott said.  . “On this basis, it seems sensible for current drinkers to consider moderating the amount of alcohol they consume, and for non-drinkers to remain abstinent,” he said.  . Assigning a group to drink alcohol and another to abstain for a study would be unethical, so researchers have to try more sophisticated ways of comparing people in the real world and trying to account for other differences between them, he noted. . There is no good biological explanation for why light drinking might benefit older women, according to Jürgen Rehm, director of the Social and Epidemiological Research (SER) Department of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada. . “Let us face it: alcohol is not consumed for health reasons,” Rehm told Reuters Health by email. “To avoid too much risk, people should drink lightly, best one drink at most per day. Most European drinkers exceed this limit and put themselves into risk.” . As age increases, it gets harder and takes longer for the body to eliminate ethanol from the blood, the authors note. Alcohol-related hospitalizations and deaths are most common for older age groups, they write.  . “Nobody should drink alcohol for health reasons,” Rehm said. . SOURCE: .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters) - Young Americans are increasingly using suffocation and hanging to commit suicide, according to government data released on Thursday. . Deaths by those means rose every year from 1994 to 2012 among females and males aged 10 to 24 year olds, for reasons that remain unclear, according to a report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). . Unlike suicide attempts that involve poisoning, suffocation and hanging are much more likely to result in death, the researchers noted. . “A person’s first attempt may be their last attempt,” said Dr. Eric Caine, director of the Injury Control Research Center for Suicide Prevention at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who was not involved in the new report. . By 2012, the rate of suicide by suffocation and hanging had reached 4.5 deaths per 100,000 among young men, up from 3 per 100,000 in 1994, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The rate among young women more than tripled, to 1.7 per 100,000 in 2012 from 0.5 in 1994. . Overall suicide rates decreased among young males to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2012 from 15.7 in 1994, the CDC researchers found. Rates rose slightly among young females to 3.2 per 100,000 in 2012 from 2.7 in 1994. . Guns were the most common way young men committed suicide, at a rate of 5.9 per 100,000. Among young women, suffocation and hanging were most common, surpassing firearms in 2001. Suicide by poisoning was least common for both sexes. . While the rate of suicide by firearms fluctuated during the study period, suicide by suffocation and hanging increased steadily. . “Certain methods appeal to certain people,” Caine said. “It’s not true that if you prevent suicide in one method, they go to another.” . The CDC researchers write that people should be aware of the increased use of more lethal suicide methods, a trend that underlines the need for early prevention strategies to keep young people from having suicidal thoughts and to identify those at risk. |Thu Mar 05 18:35:04 +0000 2015||Suicide by suffocation increasing among U.S. youths: study |5.735523216129229e+17|http://reut.rs/1CCsSns
|(Reuters) - An updated experimental form of AbbVie Inc’s Humira arthritis drug has clear advantages over the original that could help the company confront looming cheaper biosimilar forms of the blockbuster medication, Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said in an interview. . “It’s a fundamental change in the formulation of Humira,” Gonzalez said. “I wouldn’t describe it as a tweak.” Asked if AbbVie intends to switch current Humira patients to the new formulation, if it is approved, he said it was too soon to predict, but that such a strategy would make sense. |Thu Mar 05 18:03:41 +0000 2015||AbbVie CEO says new form of Humira could thwart generics |5.735444249883443e+17|http://reut.rs/1CCecVt
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Dentists may be able to screen patients for diabetes while cleaning their teeth, a small study suggests. . Researchers found that testing for diabetes using blood that appears on the gums during a routine oral cleaning might be just as accurate as a standard screening that gets a blood sample by pricking the finger with a tiny needle.  . “There are more than 8 million people in this country who have diabetes and don’t know it, and many of these people see a dentist much more regularly than they see a primary care provider,” said lead study author Sheila Strauss. . “If dentists can screen for diabetes, it may help people get treated sooner when we can get better results managing their disease,” said Strauss, an associate professor of nursing and co-director of the Statistics and Data Management Core for New York University’s colleges of nursing and dentistry. . Worldwide, nearly one in 10 adults had diabetes in 2014, and the disease will be the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, according to the World Health Organization.  . Most of these people have type 2, once known as adult-onset, diabetes, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy.  . Strauss and colleagues focused their research on testing hemoglobin A1c, a protein in red blood cells that gets coated with sugar over time, making it a gauge of average blood sugar levels for the past two or three months.  . The researchers collected blood samples taken from the gums and the fingers of 408 people treated at dental clinics in New York City. They tested for diabetes, when A1c is at least 6.5 percent, and for elevated “prediabetic” A1c levels of at least 5.7 percent. . To make sure they got enough blood from the gums, they only included people in the study who said that their gums bled when they brushed or flossed their teeth. . The study team also limited participation to people at greatest risk for diabetes. To be included, people had to be at least 45 years old. Or, if they were younger, they had to be overweight and have at least one other risk factor such as an immediate family member with diabetes, a daily routine with little or no exercise, or an ethnicity or race with high diabetes risk, including Latino, black, Native American and Pacific Islander.  . The oral-blood and finger-prick test results matched in 97.8 percent of cases diagnosing diabetes, and in 92.9 percent of cases finding prediabetes. And, the oral blood test was able to accurately rule out diabetes 99.1 percent of the time, according to the results published in the American Journal of Public Health. . Because the sample for the study wasn’t random, and participants were instead selected based on their expected risk for diabetes, it’s possible that the results might not apply to a wider population of people, Strauss said.  . One advantage of the selection criteria, though, is that many people with bleeding gums have periodontal disease or gingivitis – both oral health problems that are more common among diabetics, she said. . While the screening approach tested in the study would need to be proven effective by additional research, the possibility of dentists doing oral screenings for diabetes has the potential to help many undiagnosed people get treatment, said Betul Hatipoglu, an endocrinologist and clinical associate professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.  . To be sure, dentists would need training on how to explain the test results to patients who are positive for prediabetes or diabetes, and they would also need a plan in place to refer these people to specialists who can treat the disease, added Hatipoglu, who wasn’t involved in the study. . “If the test in this study proves effective with more research, it is going to help get many individuals, especially young adults, who are not going to see a primary care provider unless they are sick,” Hatipoglu said. . “I can also see this helping men in their 30s who don’t see anybody except to get their teeth cleaned, or women who only go to the OB-gyn to get an annual checkup or prenatal care and don’t think about anything else,” she said. .

Zachary Fagenson|MIAMI (Reuters) - A $5 million class-action lawsuit filed this week in Florida accuses hardwood and laminate flooring giant Lumber Liquidators, Inc of selling products laden with cancer-causing chemicals. . The case, filed on Tuesday in federal court in Miami, claims the company “deceptively manufactured, labeled and sold the toxic laminate flooring.” . A similar lawsuit was filed late last year in California.  . U.S. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, called on federal agencies Wednesday to investigate the Delaware-based company’s flooring.  . “Because this could affect millions of homeowners, it’s imperative we get some answers quickly,” Nelson said. . His statement followed a report Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that found high levels of the carcinogen formaldehyde in the lumber company’s products. . The report sampled Chinese-made laminate flooring sold in California, Virginia, Florida, Texas, and Illinois.  . Out of 31 samples, CBS found only one was compliant with California formaldehyde emissions standards. . Lumber Liquidators representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. . The company has disputed the network’s testing methods and said it complies with U.S. emissions regulations.  . In the Southern District of Florida the case is number 1:15-cv-20876, Joaquin F.

James Harding Giahyue|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia’s last Ebola patient left hospital on Thursday to cheers of delight from friends and family, a year after the West African country reported its first case.  . Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, was once at the heart of an epidemic that has killed nearly 10,000 across West Africa. Liberia has reported no new Ebola cases in 13 days, but can be deemed  Ebola-free only after 42 days have passed — double the normal incubation period for the virus. . Dressed in a bright orange T-shirt and multi-colored beads, a joyous Beatrice Yardolo greeted a small crowd outside the Chinese Ebola treatment center in the Paynesville suburb of Monrovia, where she was hospitalized for two weeks. . Chinese healthcare workers took turns to congratulate her, offering a bouquet of red flowers, a toy panda and a survivor’s certificate, as soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) looked on. . “I am very grateful to the Chinese treatment center and the Almighty God that I lived to see this day. I did not know I would make it,” said Yardolo, who comes from the St. Paul’s Bridge suburb, which has since January been one of Liberia’s last remaining hot spots. . Yardolo has lost three children to the hemorrhagic fever. Ebola spreads through bodily fluids like saliva and vomit and her family is thought to have been infected by a son who caught it while working as a dental hygienist. . “It makes me feel happy. It makes me feel like our country is coming to the end of a very horrible period,” said her son Joel Yardolo. . “Today signifies a very great day for our country. When the news was bad, we reported it. We stand here today to signify good news,” said Tolbert Nyenswah, head of Liberia’s Ebola response. . However, Nyenswah called on Liberians to observe strict measures to eradicate the disease, adding more than 100 Ebola contacts were still under surveillance. . Health officials say a lack of compliance with guidelines has created additional contacts in recent weeks. . In one instance, a woman was sent away from a clinic even though she was Ebola positive. In another, a policewoman with the disease helped her son skip quarantine, a Western health official in Liberia said. . Since the epidemic was first discovered a year ago, the rate of infection has sometimes ebbed only to flare up again more fiercely. Neighboring Sierra Leone appeared to be controlling the outbreak in Freetown until fishermen carried the virus back, causing a spike in cases. . The World Health Organization said Guinea and Sierra Leone reported a total of 132 new cases in the week to March 1, an increase of 34 over the previous week. |Thu Mar 05 16:15:45 +0000 2015||Liberia releases last known Ebola patient from care |5.735172622436311e+17|http://reut.rs/1ALSuHC
|(Reuters) - An injection for “double chin” reduction developed by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc cleared the first hurdle toward approval as U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff concluded the drug’s benefits outweighed its risks. . Kythera’s stock jumped as much as 25 percent as investors bet on what could be the first approved drug in the United States to reduce localized fat deposits. . The drug, ATX-101, is a formulation of deoxycholic acid, which destroys fat cells under the chin but leaves surrounding tissue largely unaffected. . Existing options are limited to surgeries performed under general anesthesia and liposuction. . No safety issues associated with long-term use of ATX-101 have been identified so far, FDA reviewers said on Thursday.  . An independent panel of experts will meet on Monday to discuss the drug and recommend to the FDA whether it should be approved. The FDA typically accepts the panel’s recommendations. . Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said he expects the drug to be approved by May 13, when the FDA is scheduled to make its final decision. . Last year, Kythera regained rights to the market the drug outside the United States and Canada from a unit of Germany’s Bayer AG. . The drug is also being reviewed by Canadian and Swiss regulators. |Thu Mar 05 16:13:17 +0000 2015||FDA staff backs Kythera's injection to reduce double chin |5.735166425729884e+17|http://reut.rs/1CBJ4Fv
Daniel Gaitan|(Reuters Health) - Advocates hope that people with colorectal cancer and their caregivers will dress in blue on Friday to raise awareness about the disease, which is the second-leading cancer-related cause of death in the U.S. . Each year on the first Friday in March, supporters hold “Dress in Blue Day” to encourage more Americans to be tested for the disease. In 2000, President Clinton designated March as National Colon Cancer Awareness Month. Blue is the long-established color. . “You need to be screened, and Dress in Blue Day is about getting people to recognize that,” said Eric Hargis, CEO of Colon Cancer Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit patient advocacy organization. . Andrea Shepherd, executive director of the Colon Cancer Prevention Project, a Kentucky-based nonprofit working to eliminate preventable colon cancer death, hopes that all health care organizations participate in the day. . “Wear blue and talk about colon cancer. Talk about screening, talk about prevention of this disease, talk with your family and ask if they’ve been screened or if the disease runs in your family,” she told Reuters Health. . Shepherd, a former reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal, joined the organization after her father died from the disease at age 57. . While a small percentage of people have genes that increase their risk, most of the time colorectal cancer “just occurs,” without risk factors, said Dr. Mary F. Mulcahy of the Department of Hematology Oncology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. . Colon cancer occurs equally in men and women, Mulcahy said, most commonly when people are in their early 60s. Experts recommend that people get screened at age 50.  . The National Cancer Institute advises people at average risk of colorectal cancer to get screened at regular intervals with either high-sensitivity fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. People should talk with their doctor to determine which test is best for them. . Because polyps and colorectal cancers can bleed, FOBTs check for tiny amounts of blood in feces that can’t be seen. FOBT costs about $5 per test before insurance, according to Colon Cancer Alliance, Inc. If the FOBT is positive, then a colonoscopy is necessary.  . But it’s a mistake to think the disease is totally preventable, Mulcahy said. “Advocates say that and it makes it out like the people who get it, it’s their fault.” She added, “You don’t want to give that message. . “Not everybody has identifiable polyps,” she added, and a significant number of people get colon cancer before age 50. . “To a large part,” Mulcahy said, “the incidence has decreased, because people get screening colonoscopies that remove polyps, but there are some people who wouldn’t be in the (screening) age group.”|Thu Mar 05 15:55:21 +0000 2015||Wear blue on Friday to raise colon cancer awareness |5.735121298458378e+17|http://reut.rs/1ALRgfn
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - AbbVie’s $21 billion deal to buy Pharmacyclics shows big pharma’s hunger for new drugs at a time when research at smaller biotechnology companies is driving some of the most promising advances in medicine. . Competition for tomorrow’s blockbuster drugs is now intense, inflating the cost of deals and pushing pharmaceuticals to center stage in overall mergers and acquisitions (M&A). . So far this year, pharma deals have accounted for 10.5 percent of total M&A worldwide, up from a more traditional share of 3 to 4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. . AbbVie’s planned purchase of Pharmacyclics is the largest global pharmaceutical deal of 2015 to date and takes M&A activity in the sector to a six-year high. . M&A transactions targeting biotech and pharma companies in 2015 have now reached $59.3 billion, a 94 percent increase over the same period a year ago and the highest volume for this stage in any year since 2009. For a graphic on pharma deals see .  . Across the industry, big drugmakers are eyeing medicines developed by nimble biotech firms as they seek to replenish portfolios that are being eroded as older products face loss of patent protection. . Pharmacyclics gives AbbVie access to a blood cancer treatment called Imbruvica that is expected to be one of the world’s top-selling cancer drugs, reducing its reliance on the ageing rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.  . “This acquisition serves as a reminder that large pharma is willing to pay up for novel, quality products,” said Maxim Jacobs, an analyst at Edison Investment Research.   . The deal also signals AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez’s readiness to chase other assets after a failed deal to buy Shire for $55 billion last year. . In many ways, 2014 was the year of deals that didn’t happen. Not only did AbbVie’s plans for Shire unravel but Pfizer proved unable to land AstraZeneca after a $118 billion takeover fight. . Yet both U.S. predators have now bounced back with alternative deals, with Pfizer agreeing to buy Hospira, a specialist in injectable drugs, for around $15 billion last month. . Valeant Pharmaceuticals also agreed last month to acquire gastrointestinal drugmaker Salix Pharmaceuticals for more than $10 billion in another notable biotech transaction.  |Thu Mar 05 13:44:42 +0000 2015||Biotech buys get pharma M&amp;A off to flying start in 2015 |5.7347925151462605e+17|http://reut.rs/1ALK5UH
|MUMBAI (Reuters) - A panel of advisors to the Indian government has recommended that late-stage clinical trials be waived under certain conditions for some new drugs already being sold on international markets. . Indian law requires all medicines to be tested in late-stage clinical trials before being approved for sale. The requirements can be shortened, deferred, or omitted in certain cases, such as life-threatening diseases. . The recommendations were made last month at a meeting of the Drugs Technical Advisory Board, which advises the central and state governments on technical matters related to drug regulations. . The 19-member panel agreed that clinical trials for new drugs already selling in a “well regulated country” may be waived, if the safety and efficacy of the drug is found to be “favorable”, according to minutes of the meeting. . The evaluation of such new drugs should be made in consultation with experts on specific therapeutic areas, the panel advised. . A waiver to late-stage trials would significantly speed up the approvals process for new drugs and will likely be cheered, chiefly by foreign drugmakers who have decried India’s strict rules and red tape around clinical trial approvals. . The recommendations were posted on the drugs regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s website last week. . They will now go to the health ministry for approval before new rules can be implemented, three members of the panel said on the condition of anonymity as the details are not public yet. . “The waivers will be granted in very rare circumstances, and the global clinical trials of the drug will also be closely looked at to ensure ethnic differences do not affect the efficacy or safety of the drug,” one of the members said. |Thu Mar 05 13:29:08 +0000 2015||Indian panel recommends waiving late-stage trials for some drugs |5.7347533216404275e+17|http://reut.rs/1ALJrXj
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Arrowhead Research Corp said it acquired Novartis AG’s RNAi assets to fortify its position in the field of gene therapy that aims to wipe out disease-causing proteins.  . The deal gives Arrowhead the freedom to operate in any target for any indication, strengthening the belief that RNAi therapeutics is a bilateral field - there’s Alnylam and there’s Arrowhead, Chief Executive Christopher Anzalone told Reuters. . Novartis is eligible to receive $25 million in Arrowhead shares within 30 days, which would make it the second-largest shareholder based on Arrowhead’s market value on Wednesday.     . French drugmaker Sanofi SA bought a 12 percent stake in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc for $700 million last year. . Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapy has stirred the interest of drugmakers as it aims to silence certain genes to inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins. . Available therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, try to inactivate these proteins by binding to them.  . The deal announced on Thursday gives Arrowhead access to Novartis’ RNAi portfolio and associated assets, including various patents and three drugs in the preclinical stage.  . It also includes a component that could enhance the efficiency of Arrowhead’s RNAi triggers, and provides access to some Alnylam intellectual property on 30 gene-targets hand-picked by Novartis. . “It’s a complicated and unsettled IP landscape and we have just increased our freedom here,” Anzalone said.  . Alnylam and another major competitor, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc, extended their partnership earlier this year to cross-license IP on four disease-targets. . Thursday’s transaction, which also includes a $10 million cash component, is reminiscent of a 2011 deal between Arrowhead and Roche Holding AG, where Roche transferred its RNA assets in exchange for a stake.  . The Roche deal gave Arrowhead its delivery platform, which is used to shepherd RNAs to their specified target, shielding them from enzymes that tend to destroy them.  .

Vidya L Nathan|(Reuters) - Dublin-based drugmaker Mallinckrodt Plc strengthened its presence in U.S. hospitals as it agreed to buy privately held Ikaria Inc, a maker of a respiratory drug and its delivery system, for $2.3 billion. . Shares of Mallinckrodt, a seller of generics, specialty drugs and medical imaging agents, jumped as much as 6.7 percent to a record $123.95. . The deal gives Mallinckrodt access to INOmax, which Ikeria says is the only approved product to treat hypoxic respiratory failure in infants. The device that delivers nitric oxide has been available in the market for about a decade and a half. . Hypoxic respiratory failure affects about 25,000-30,000 babies born each year in the United States. INOmax currently caters to about half of that population, Mallinckrodt CEO Mark Trudeau said in a call on Thursday. . Ikaria, owned by a group of investors led by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, is testing INOmax for treating other breathing difficulties and a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and heart. . Madison Dearborn will get 2.8 times the $224 million it invested in Hampton, New Jersey-based Ikaria a little over a year ago, a person familiar with the matter said.  . New Mountain Capital, which invested about $220 million in 2007, will receive as much as $880 million, other people familiar with the matter said. . Analysts from at least three brokerages — BMO Capital, Leerink Swann and Oppenheimer & Co — said the deal made sense for Mallinckrodt. . The deal comes a year after Mallinckrodt, spun off from Covidien Plc in 2013, bought Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion. . Mallinckrodt, which claims to have its products in almost every U.S. hospital, diagnostic imaging center and pharmacy, said it expects Ikeria to add at least $150 million to its sales and 25 cents to earnings per share for the year ending September. . Mallinckrodt, which recorded sales of $866.3 million in its first quarter ended Dec. 26, plans to fund the deal with a combination of cash on hand and debt. . Goldman Sachs is Mallinckrodt’s financial adviser, and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox in Ireland its legal advisers. Ikaria’s legal adviser is Kirkland & Ellis LLP. . Mallinckrodt shares were up 4.3 percent at $121.18 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. |Thu Mar 05 12:50:37 +0000 2015||Mallinckrodt to buy private respiratory drug and device maker for $2.3 billion |5.7346564032711475e+17|http://reut.rs/1CARLQl
Eric M. Johnson|PARKLAND, Wash. (Reuters) - Sealed bags of marijuana dangle behind a counter, curved glass pipes glimmer on shelves, and a steady trickle of middle-aged customers gleefully buys cannabis strains nicknamed Charlie Sheen and Godzilla. . “The Gallery” is similar to more than 100 other lawful state-licensed marijuana retail shops and hundreds of medical dispensaries in Washington state, with one exception: It is operating in defiance of local law. . Its opening on Sunday set up a potential showdown with authorities in Pierce County, about an hour outside Seattle, which has effectively banned recreational pot shops in unincorporated areas so long as the drug remains illegal under federal law, even as medical pot businesses flourish virtually unregulated. . “We didn’t do this to pick a fight with the county,” said co-owner Tedd Wetherbee, 47, in between chatting up customers in his shop in Parkland, in unincorporated Pierce County. . “But at the same time we are state-licensed legitimate businessmen that want to do what the county seems to let other people do without any license.” . Since Washington state legalized recreational marijuana in a landmark 2012 vote that ushered in licensed retail pot shops in July, scores of municipalities have passed laws curbing their operations, from constricted zoning to outright bans. . That has frustrated would-be pot entrepreneurs, such as Wetherbee, who are keen to capitalize on what they call a glut of recreational-use marijuana products with few stores licensed to sell it. Fifty-four percent of Pierce County voters backed marijuana legalization. . “This act of theater will either embolden a bunch of other people to do it, or it will create really great PR for him,” said Dominic Corva, executive director at the Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social Policy. . Wetherbee has argued in lawsuits that local pot-business bans that scuttled his retail plans in two other towns violate state law, and says it makes little sense to ban tightly regulated retail establishments while allowing medicinal shops to operate unchecked. . State lawmakers are weighing proposals to license medical-use stores to, among other things, ensure their products are safe, a move entrepreneurs say would help level the regulatory playing field. . Amid that uncertain landscape, Pierce County authorities say they have visited The Gallery for several inspections and advised Wetherbee he lacked proper permitting. . Pierce County, which had objected to Wetherbee’s application for a state retail pot license but failed to block it, could issue noncompliance and cease-and-desist orders as early as Thursday that could cost up to $1,000 in daily fines if ignored. . Washington state’s top lawyer has said the recreational marijuana law does not prevent local governments from banning pot businesses. But state regulators who grant the licenses do not consider local laws in their review process. . “We have issued other state licenses in places where there are bans and moratoriums, though he is the only retailer that I have heard of, but there may be others,” said Liquor Control Board spokesman Brian Smith. . There was no sign of controversy on Tuesday in Wetherbee’s shop, where pot products are displayed beside sculptures and abstract art. Its nondescript entrance contrasts sharply with the bold signage of a gun shop next door. . A cut-out of former President Bill Clinton invites shoppers to “please feel free to inhale.” A security guard checks that patrons are at least 21 years old. Sealed bags of cannabis strains sell for about $14 to $24 per gram. . Among the patrons was a construction worker who uses marijuana to “kick back” and a 29-year-old former U.S. Army medic battling insomnia and anxiety since returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. . “I was going to a store down in the city (Tacoma), but this is a lot closer to my house,” said the former soldier, who gave his name only as Josh. “I like the environment a lot better too, the gallery feel.” |Thu Mar 05 12:16:57 +0000 2015||Washington state cannabis retailer opens in defiance of county ban |5.734571663481897e+17|http://reut.rs/1CAKxM9
|BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp’s German arm is liable for the cost of operations to replace potentially defective pacemakers, Europe’s top court ruled on Thursday. . The European Court of Justice ruled that, where a medical device has a potential defect, it is possible to classify as defective all products of the same model. . The German company, an importer of Boston Scientific pacemakers and now a subsidiary of the U.S. company, informed physicians in 2005 that a hermetic sealing component might experience gradual degradation, leading to premature battery depletion. . It therefore recommended that doctors consider replacing the devices and agreed to provide replacement devices at no charge to patients. . However, when presented with bills from German health insurers to cover the cost of surgery, Boston Scientific’s German subsidiary contested payment. . The European Court was asked by Germany’s Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof) to rule whether a product should be classified as defective based solely on quality controls showing the risk of a problem without having to determine whether a replaced item itself was in fact flawed. . It was also asked to consider whether the manufacturer should bear the costs of operations to replace its products. The court ruled on Thursday the producer should. |Thu Mar 05 10:33:25 +0000 2015||EU court rules Boston Scientific must pay pacemaker replacement surgery |5.734311123216302e+17|http://reut.rs/1CAneCm
Kate Kelland|LONDON/GENEVA (Reuters) - Final stage trials of an Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck and NewLink Genetics will begin in Guinea on March 7, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. . Signaling global health authorities’ determination to see through trials despite a sharp drop in cases in the West Africa epidemic, the WHO said a second shot, developed by GlaxoSmithKline will be tested “in a sequential study, as supply becomes available”. . More than 23,900 confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola have been reported since the outbreak began in December 2013, including some 9,800 deaths. Nearly 500 health workers have been among the dead in what is the worst ever Ebola epidemic. . All three worst-hit countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - aim to conduct final-stage trials of vaccines, and Liberia is already testing the GlaxoSmithKline and Merck-NewLink shots, while Sierra Leone is expected to announce plans soon. . But recent steep declines in new Ebola cases will make it far harder to prove whether experimental vaccines work, as the vaccine’s effect will be difficult to establish. . The WHO, however, said it was committed to pushing ahead. . “The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let down our guard until we reach zero cases,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, head of the WHO’s Ebola research and development effort. . “An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.” . The trial in the Basse Guinée region, which has Guinea’s most cases, will use a “ring vaccination” strategy similar to that used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. This involves vaccinating everyone who has been in contact with a newly diagnosed person or “index” case.  . “Testing investigational medicines during an epidemic is incredibly challenging, but this approach gives us the best possible chance of finding a safe and effective vaccine in time to save lives,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome Trust, the medical charity that has led the push for Ebola vaccines. . In Liberia, where no new cases have been reported for 13 days, the government says the trial is a “resounding success”.  . But local media has reported that some residents are refusing measles and polio vaccinations amid rumors of a deliberate plot to infect them with Ebola. |Thu Mar 05 10:19:57 +0000 2015||Merck-NewLink Ebola vaccine Phase III trial to start March 7 |5.734277236385587e+17|http://reut.rs/1CAk1CQ
|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer said it would not get any relevant results from a Phase III trial of regorafenib, a drug also known as Stivarga, for the treatment of colorectal cancer, because it failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants. . The study in the third and last phase required for regulatory approval was designed to evaluate regorafenib as an additional treatment of colorectal cancer following surgical removal of liver metastases with curative intent. . “As a result of slow patient accrual, the study will be closed to further enrolment before the study endpoints can be assessed. Importantly, there were no new safety signals from the     study,” Bayer said in a statement. . Bayer will continue to evaluate regorafenib in a number of tumor types, including colorectal cancer, it added. |Thu Mar 05 08:45:22 +0000 2015||Bayer says won't get results from Stivarga trial in bowel cancer |5.73403920007082e+17|http://reut.rs/1CzZP3M
Lisa Baertlein|LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections, the most aggressive step by a major food company to change chicken producers’ practices in the fight against dangerous ‘superbugs.’ . The world’s biggest restaurant chain announced on Wednesday that within two years, McDonald’s USA will only buy chickens raised without antibiotics that are important to human medicine. The concern is that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald’s policy will begin at the hatchery, where chicks are sometimes injected with antibiotics while still in the shell. . “We’re listening to our customers,” Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald’s North American supply chain, told Reuters. She said the company is working with its domestic chicken suppliers, including Tyson Foods Inc, to make the transition. . Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the rate of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. . Scientists and public health experts say whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and can enable the strongest to survive and multiply. Frequent use of low-dose antibiotics, a practice used by some meat producers, can intensify that effect. The risk, they say, is that so-called superbugs might develop cross-resistance to critical, medically important antibiotics. . Superbugs are linked to an estimated 23,000 human deaths and 2 million illnesses every year in the United States, and up to $20 billion in direct healthcare costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food. . Gross said McDonald’s expects its suppliers will treat any animals that become ill, using antibiotics when prescribed. McDonald’s, however, will not buy those treated chickens, she said. . The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.   . This may be a “tipping point for antibiotic use in the poultry industry,” said Jonathan Kaplan, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s food and agriculture program director. . “McDonald’s has so much purchasing power and brand recognition, I think we’re seeing a new industry standard here,” Kaplan said.   . “For public health, this is really a game changer,” said Gail Hansen, a senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts’ antibiotic resistance project. . There are exceptions to McDonald’s new policy. The company will buy chicken from farmers who “responsibly use” ionophores, an animal antibiotic not used in human medical treatment, Gross said. . The phase-out applies only to McDonald’s roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It currently does not affect the company’s approximately 22,000 international restaurants. . The action by McDonald’s, which has been fighting to win back diners and bolster sagging U.S. sales, is in step with consumer demand for food made with ‘clean’ and more ‘natural’ ingredients. But it falls short of similar policies at smaller  chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread Co, which ban the use of ionophores. . Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor, told Reuters in a statement it supported McDonald’s decision and that its chicken operations have reduced the use of antibiotics that are effective in humans by more than 84 percent since 2011. The company expects to continue reductions.  . A Reuters investigation last year revealed that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely fed chickens an array of antibiotics, not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives. . The Reuters report also found that low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some of Tyson’s flocks, including two internal company documents showing the use of bacitracin. Though that drug is not classified as medically important by the federal Food and Drug Administration, bacitracin is commonly used to prevent human skin infections. . Tyson said it disagreed with the findings of the Reuters investigation but has since taken further steps to reduce or halt antibiotic use, including in its chicken hatcheries. |Thu Mar 05 03:05:21 +0000 2015||McDonald's USA to phase out human antibiotics from chicken supply |5.733183538986107e+17|http://reut.rs/1CyReOR
Lawrence Hurley|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court appeared sharply divided on ideological lines on Wednesday as it tackled a second major challenge to President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, with Justice Anthony Kennedy emerging as a likely swing vote in a ruling. . The nine justices heard 85 minutes of arguments in the case brought by conservative opponents of the law who contend its tax credits aimed at helping people afford medical insurance should not be available in most states. A ruling favoring the challengers could cripple the law dubbed Obamacare, the president’s signature domestic policy achievement. . Kennedy, a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases, raised concerns to lawyers on both sides about the possible negative impact on states if the government loses the case, suggesting he could back the Obama administration. But he did not commit to supporting either side. . Chief Justice John Roberts, who supplied the key vote in a 5-4 ruling in 2012 upholding the law in the previous challenge, said little to signal how he might vote. . The court’s four liberals appeared supportive of the government. Conservatives Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito asked questions sympathetic to the challengers. Fellow conservative Clarence Thomas, following his usual practice, asked nothing. . If the court rules against the Obama administration, up to 7.5 million people in at least 34 states would lose the tax subsidies that help low- and moderate-income people buy private health insurance, according to consulting firm Avalere Health. . The court challenge was financed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian Washington group.  . The legal question is whether a four-word phrase in the expansive law saying subsidies are available to those buying insurance on exchanges “established by the state” has been correctly interpreted by the administration to allow subsidies to be available nationwide. . Exchanges are online marketplaces that allow consumers to shop among competing insurance plans. . Kennedy’s concerns focused on the possibility that if the law allows subsidies only for states that set up their own insurance exchanges, it would raise a new, more serious question about whether the law is unconstitutionally coercive by essentially punishing states that fail to establish exchanges. . “There’s a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument,” Kennedy told the challengers’ lawyer, Michael Carvin. . Kennedy said throwing out subsidies would potentially unlawfully pressure states and cause an insurance “death spiral” because premiums would increase. But Kennedy indicated he had an open mind over the challengers’ interpretation of the law. . “It may well be that you’re correct as to these words, and there’s nothing we can do,” Kennedy said. . Alito disputed Obama administration lawyer Donald Verrilli’s assertions about the disruptive impact of a ruling allowing subsidies only in states maintaining their own exchanges. Alito said states could simply establish new exchanges. . “Going forward, there would be no harm,” Alito said. . Most of the 50 states have not created exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have them, with another 34 run by the federal government and three operating as state-federal hybrids. . When Verrilli said people would lose tax credits immediately if the government loses, Alito suggested delaying the ruling’s effective date to the end of the tax year. . Scalia said Congress could potentially amend the law to avoid disruption if the government loses. Verrilli expressed skepticism the Republican-led House of Representatives and Senate would do so. . Asked about Alito’s comments, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said there are “no contingency plans that could be implemented that would prevent the catastrophic damage” to the law from a ruling favoring the challengers.  . Earnest doubted a legislative remedy, saying Republicans who control Congress “struggle mightily to do even the simplest, most politically popular things” and have fought Obamacare “tooth and nail.” . One possible outcome is the court could find the law  ambiguous and defer to the government’s interpretation. In one of his few remarks, Roberts said that would allow a future president to reverse course. One Kennedy remark indicated he would not support resolving the case that way. . On a chilly, damp, cloudy day, a couple hundred demonstrators mostly from pro-Obamacare forces gathered outside the white marble columned courthouse. A couple dozen demonstrators from the conservative Tea Party movement rallied against the law. . The Democratic-backed Affordable Care Act, narrowly passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition, aimed to help millions of Americans without health insurance obtain coverage. Conservatives call Obamacare a government overreach.  . Hospitals have benefited financially from customers newly insured via exchanges. Their shares have been under pressure amid the risk Obamacare insurance would disappear if the subsidies are dismantled as the challengers demand. . During Wednesday’s arguments, Community Health Systems Inc shares rose 5.6 percent, HCA Holdings rose 7.7 percent and Tenet Healthcare Corp rose 6 percent as investors saw Kennedy’s comments as an indication he would side with the government, analysts said. . The case is King v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-114. |Thu Mar 05 01:30:51 +0000 2015||U.S. Supreme Court split over Obamacare challenge |5.7329456871788134e+17|http://reut.rs/1CyxGKz
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators issued an updated safety alert on Wednesday for endoscopes linked to drug-resistant “superbug” bacteria in California hospitals. . The Food and Drug Administration said it was not recommending that healthcare providers cancel procedures performed with a duodenoscope for patients who need them.  . It did recommend that healthcare providers inform patients of the risks, including infection, and benefits associated with the procedure and report to the manufacturer and the FDA if they suspect problems with the equipment have led to patient infections. . The alert followed news on Wednesday that four patients at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles were infected with a drug-resistant bacteria during endoscopic procedures that may have exposed 64 others since August. . On Feb. 19, the UCLA Health System reported that 179 of its patients may have been exposed to the bacteria during endoscopic procedures since October. It said seven of those patients were confirmed to have been infected, and two of them had died. . In a safety alert the same day, the FDA said the complex design of endoscopes linked to the UCLA outbreak may hinder proper cleaning. . The FDA said it wanted to raise awareness among healthcare professionals that the complex design of the devices - flexible tubes that are threaded through the mouth, throat and stomach to drain fluids from blocked pancreatic and biliary ducts - is associated with a risk of multidrug-resistant infections even when a manufacturer’s cleaning instructions are followed correctly. . Makers of the devices, known as duodenoscopes, include Olympus Corp, Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Pentax Medical. . After outbreaks, hospitals that began sterilizing the devices more rigorously than the FDA and manufacturers recommend have not had any further transmissions of dangerous microbes from the devices, the hospitals said. |Thu Mar 05 01:30:50 +0000 2015||U.S. FDA updates safety alert for 'superbug' scopes |5.73294566754943e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWTwVQ
Steve Gorman|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A second top Los Angeles hospital has reported an outbreak of drug-resistant “superbug” infections, and dozens more potential exposures, from procedures performed with a fiber-optic instrument called a duodenoscope. . The notice from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of four such infections and 67 more patients who were at risk coincided with a hospital in Hartford, Connecticut, reporting a similar outbreak involving at least five infections and more than 280 potential exposures. . The Cedars-Sinai cases, like the larger number of infections and potential exposures reported last month at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles, involved a family of germs called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. . The bacteria identified on Wednesday in the Hartford Hospital outbreak was a drug-resistant strain of E.coli.  . But the procedure and instrument implicated at all three hospitals were the same - an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP, performed with a duodenoscope. . The Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, issued an updated safety alert for duodenoscopes, urging medical providers to inform patients of the risks, including possible transmission of infection, associated with the use of such instruments. . The alert also puts providers on notice to report any infections they suspect were caused by problems with the scopes to the manufacturer and the FDA. . The latest flurry of infections has raised new questions about whether manufacturers’ recommendations for disinfecting duodenoscopes are sufficient to protect patients. . The complex design of the instrument - flexible tubes that are threaded down the throat and stomach to the top of the small intestine to drain fluids from blocked pancreatic and bile ducts - may hinder proper cleaning, the FDA has warned. . A senior FDA official said this week that manufacturers’ own tests of disinfection measures they recommend contained flaws that rendered those cleaning procedures unreliable. . Makers of the devices include such camera companies as Olympus Corp (. ), Fujifilm Holdings Corp (. ) and Pentax.     . Olympus was the maker of the single duodenoscope linked to all 71 patients of concern at Cedars-Sinai, from August 2014 to February 2015, and of two suspect scopes tied to 179 potential exposures dating back to October at UCLA.  . Seven of UCLA patients were confirmed to have been infected, and two of them had died. . One of the four infected Cedars-Sinai patients died from “an underlying disease,” not from the bacteria, as the infection had by then been cleared, the hospital said in its statement. . Hartford Hospital said it found five or six of its patients had contracted drug-resistant E.coli last year from two duodenoscopes used in 281 more procedures, leading doctors to conclude that those additional patients may have been exposed. . Both privately run Cedars-Sinai and UCLA, a public hospital, say they were offering potentially exposed patients free home-testing kits. The two facilities also said they have begun using enhanced disinfection procedures, above and beyond the manufacturer recommendations. . Duodenoscopes have been associated with episodic infections for more than a decade. But an increasing number of germs have developed a resistance to antibiotics, making them potentially more dangerous and difficult to treat. |Thu Mar 05 01:30:50 +0000 2015||Second Los Angeles hospital identifies 'superbug' infections |5.7329456459065344e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWTwVS
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is close to buying cancer drug maker Pharmacyclics Inc in the coming days, the Financial Times reported, citing sources. . A bid from J&J is expected to value Pharmacyclics near its $17.5 billion market value or at a premium, FT said on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.  . Shares of Pharmacyclics, which markets blood cancer drug Imbruvica with J&J’s Janssen unit, rose about 3 percent in extended trading.  . Sales of Imbruvica, which has U.S. approvals for four forms of blood cancer, are expected to touch $1 billion in the United States this year, Pharmacyclics has said earlier. . Bloomberg reported last month, citing sources, that Pharmacyclics was mulling a sale and had attracted the interest of J&J and Novartis AG. . Any interest from J&J would be logical, considering its already established relationship with Pharmacyclics, Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville told Reuters.  . Sunnyvale, California-based Pharmacyclics’ shares were trading at $238 after the bell. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had risen about 22 percent since the Bloomberg report on Feb. 25.      |Wed Mar 04 23:49:33 +0000 2015||J&amp;J nearing deal to buy cancer drug maker Pharmacyclics: FT |5.7326907552006144e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWADCs
Caroline Humer|NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. hospital executives said on Wednesday they were optimistic they will avoid the toughest consequences of a Supreme Court decision on whether millions of Americans can continue to purchase subsidized health benefits under Obamacare. . The high court heard oral arguments in the case challenging the federal tax credits that help residents in at least 34 states afford medical benefits under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law.  . Investors interpreted commentary by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a potential swing vote among the nine judges, as favorable to the Obama administration’s defense, boosting hospital shares.     . Since the subsidies were introduced last year, they have helped hospitals reduce the debt accumulated by covering the costs of uninsured patients.  . If the subsidies are deemed illegal for states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange, as many as 8 million people may no longer be able to afford coverage, according to healthcare consultants. An additional 13 states and the District of Columbia have set up their own exchanges and would not be affected. . “I am hopeful that the court will recognize and uphold the intent of Congress, which was to expand coverage as broadly as possible,” Bill Carpenter, chief executive of LifePoint Hospitals, said in an interview.  . If the court rules that the federal government cannot provide the subsidies, Carpenter and other executives interviewed by Reuters said they expected the justices would allow for a transition period before patients lose access to healthcare. . Carpenter said LifePoint is talking to members of Congress from the 21 states where it has hospitals, warning of the devastating effect on patients, particularly in the rural areas it serves. A ruling on subsidies would affect 44 of its 65 hospitals in 13 states. . Alan Miller, CEO of hospital chain Universal Health Services, expects the Obama administration would reach an agreement with Republican opponents of the law to keep subsidies in place through the end of 2015. He believes that is enough time to create a workaround to the Supreme Court ruling. . “The Republicans are already talking about providing coverage until the end of the year, until something else can be worked out,” Miller said, pointing toward the alternative plan being presented by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch and others. “Nobody wants to be in the position of denying healthcare to at least 8 million people.” . Miller said his company was also speaking with members of Congress about the importance of the coverage. Universal Health Services runs hospitals in 37 states, about two dozen of them in states relying on HealthCare.gov.  .     Carolinas HealthCare System has about 40 hospitals in North Carolina and South Carolina, where the federal government provides subsidies. President Joe Piemont said lawmakers would have to act to ensure the newly insured are not left to their own devices if the subsidies are thrown out. . “We won’t let the care fall apart, but this is not an uncertainty that we could endure for a very long time,” he said.    “We’re going to lobby through hospital associations and medical associations to admonish everybody that there needs to be a soft landing here.”  . Ascension Health, which has hospitals and clinics in 16 states using HealthCare.gov, has published opinion pieces in the press advocating the need for the subsidies. But it sees little it can do to influence the Supreme Court.  . “We are not planning for alternatives because we remain optimistic and hopeful,” said Ascension Health CEO Robert Henkel. . Universal Health shares rose 2.7 percent and LifePoint rose 3.6 percent on Wednesday. Community Health Systems, HCA Holdings and Tenet Healthcare all jumped more than 5 percent.

Steve Gorman|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Four patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles were infected with a drug-resistant “superbug” bacteria during endoscopic procedures that may have exposed 64 others since last August, the hospital said on Wednesday. . One of the four infected patients later died from “an underlying disease,” not from the bacteria, as the infection had by then been cleared, Cedars-Sinai said in its statement. . The notice came less than two weeks after another major hospital in Los Angeles, the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, reported that 179 patients may have been exposed to the same carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. . Seven of those patients were confirmed to have been infected and two of them died. . All 68 patients involved at Cedars-Sinai had undergone endoscopy procedures performed from August 2014 to February 2015 with a single duodenoscope, an instrument linked to CRE transmissions at UCLA and around the country, the hospital said. . Cedars, a privately run hospital, said it was mailing letters this week to all 68 patients as a precaution and was offering them a free home-testing kit that can be sent back to the hospital for analysis. . The complex design of the duodenoscope, used to drain fluids from pancreatic and bile ducts blocked by tumors, gallstones or other conditions, may hinder proper cleaning, the Food and Drug Administration has warned. . Cedars said the duodenoscope in question has been removed from use and that the hospital is using enhanced disinfection procedures, above and beyond the manufacturer recommendations, as it has since reports of outbreaks at other hospitals surfaced last month. |Wed Mar 04 22:48:49 +0000 2015||Second Los Angeles hospital identifies 'superbug' infections |5.732537922228552e+17|http://reut.rs/1CxYydu
|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The director of the U.S. National Cancer Institute will step down later this month after nearly five years at the helm of the agency that supports basic research on cancer in academia, industry, and its own labs, the National Institutes of Health  announced on Wednesday. . Dr. Harold Varmus’s resignation will be effective on March 31. Dr. Douglas Lowy, currently the deputy director, will become acting director on April 1. . In a letter to his NCI colleagues, Varmus, who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the cellular origin of certain cancer-causing genes, said he would establish a cancer laboratory at the Weill-Cornell Medical College in New York City and also assist the recently-founded New York Genome Center. . During his tenure, Varmus created NCI’s Center for Global Health, launched an initiative to find drugs that target a particular biochemical pathway involved in cancer, and led the cancer component of the Precision Medicine Initiative announced last month by President Barack Obama. . From 1993 to 1999, under President Bill Clinton, Varmus served as NIH director.

Gene Emery|(Reuters Health) - Doctors have long predicted that less air pollution will produce healthier lungs. Now a first-of-its-kind study of 2,120 children in southern California has documented dramatically better lung function growth as air quality has improved. . Over a 13-year period, the proportion of children with poor lung capacity and lung health fell by half as levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter dropped. The gains were seen both in youngsters who had asthma and in those who did not. . “It certainly supports the efforts that have been made over 40 years to improve air quality,” chief author Dr. James Gauderman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles told Reuters Health. “We would expect improvements in other urban centers to produce similar improvements in children’s health.” . The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, complements research showing that childhood lung function deteriorates and the risk of asthma rises as pollution levels rise. . “This is an association study, so there’s always a question of cause and effect. Maybe these people got healthier on their own, ate better diets. You can never say it’s an absolute proof,” said Dr. Norman H. Edelman, senior consultant for scientific affairs at the American Lung Association.  . “But it’s not a standalone study. It’s based on older studies that show an association between the degree of air pollution and lung function in kids. This turns around and looks at improvement,” he told Reuters Health.  . Gauderman and his colleagues examined the long-term effects in children by studying three groups during three time periods between 1994 and 2011. Typically, the children entered the study around age 11 and were followed for four years, a period when the lungs are developing rapidly. All lived in the Los Angeles area, a region of the U.S. known for air pollution problems, which have been abating as a result of strict state controls. . “We looked at the proportion of children whose lung function was below 80 percent of normal. That’s a cutoff a physician will often use to flag a person for a possible issue with their lungs,” Gauderman said. While 7.9 percent of children fell into that category in 1998, the proportion had dropped to 3.6 percent by 2011. . “We certainly suspected that improving air quality would improve children’s health,” Gauderman said. “We were surprised by the magnitude of the effect that we’ve seen.” . “What’s news about this is the large magnitude of the effect, from 8 percent down to 4 percent,” said Edelman, who was not connected to research. “Asthma is present in 10 percent of the population and that’s a major health problem. If a percentage of those kids is going to have worse asthma because the air pollution has limited their lung growth, that’s a big deal.” . During the study years, the air improved “dramatically,” Gauderman’s team writes in their report. For example, in 1994-1997, each cubic meter of air in one of the most-polluted communities, Mira Loma, had 31.5 micrograms of small particles called PM2.5 that penetrate deep into the lungs. By 2007-2010, Mira Loma averaged 17.8 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air, a 43 percent decline. All five study sites had significant drops in particle pollution and nitrogen dioxide, they note. . Overall, average lung capacity increased by 91.4 milliliters for every decrease of 14.1 parts per billion in nitrogen dioxide. It rose by 65.5 ml for each decrease of 8.7 micrograms per cubic meter of particle pollution. Significant changes were not linked to ozone levels, but levels of that pollutant have not declined as dramatically over time. . “There were significant effects on lung-function growth in both boys and girls, although the magnitude of the air-pollution effect was significantly larger in boys than in girls,” the researchers conclude. . “We found no significant association between growth in height and change in pollution during the study period, which indicates that our findings on lung-function growth are probably not the result of a secular trend in general development,” they write. . California has stricter pollution controls than the U.S. as a whole, but Edelman said even the federal clean air act has cleaned up a lot of pollution “and this study is part of that. We’re making progress. There’s still a long way to go. We still have much more unacceptable effects of air pollution than we should have.” . SOURCE: .

|(Reuters) - Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc said its experimental atopic dermatitis drug failed a mid-stage study to treat chronic itching. . Atopic dermatitis or eczema is a chronic skin rash or inflammation that often appears in infancy. It affects between 9 and 30 percent of the U.S. population, according to the National Institutes of Health. The cause of the disease is unknown. . The study data showed no statistical difference between patients on the drug, tradipitant, and those on a placebo, due to a “very high placebo effect”, the company said on Wednesday. . However, a subsequent analysis showed that patients with higher levels of tradipitant exposure at the time of assessment had clinically meaningful responses to the drug, Vanda said, adding that additional studies may be needed to confirm the findings. . Vanda licensed tradipitant from Eli Lilly and Co in 2012. . Vanda has two other drugs approved for use in the United States. The company regained the U.S. and Canada rights for its schizophrenia drug Fanapt from Novartis AG late last year. . Vanda also markets Hetlioz, which is used to regulate the internal body clocks of blind patients and help normalize sleep patterns. . Vanda’s shares, which closed at $11.06 on the Nasdaq, were down nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading. |Wed Mar 04 22:48:47 +0000 2015||Vanda's eczema drug fails mid-stage study |5.73253786455679e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWoltS
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - A new study of Medicare and private insurance claims confirms that treatment trends for localized prostate cancer differ by U.S. region, by state and even from county to county. . Overall, though, researchers found that newer, less invasive technologies, like laparoscopic prostate removal, have supplanted older treatment methods like open surgery over time. . “There are several treatment options for men with localized prostate cancer,” said lead author Dr. K. Clinton Cary of the urology department at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. . “These options have grown over time to incorporate technology advances,” Cary told Reuters Health by email. Nonetheless, he said, “It is interesting to see how treatment of the same condition varies depending on your geographic location.” . The researchers used data on more than 77,000 men in a Medicare database who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2006 in addition to more than 63,000 in a private claims database between 2002 and 2006. . Radical prostatectomy, surgery to remove the prostate gland and some surrounding tissue, held steady at 12 percent of patients over time in the Medicare group, but increased from 33 to 48 percent by 2006 in the privately insured group.  . This was the most common first method of treatment in the private insurance group in 2002, followed by external beam radiation therapy. In the Medicare group, radiation therapy was the most common first treatment, followed by hormone therapy.  . Nine percent of privately insured men and 14 percent of those on Medicare did not immediately receive treatment and were instead assigned “active surveillance,” also known as watchful waiting, an increasingly common approach to early prostate cancers. . Patients in the private insurer group tended to be younger than those on Medicare, and younger patients are more suited to radical prostatectomy, according to Dr. Axel Heidenreich, director of the urology clinic at University Hospital Aachen in Germany, who was not involved in the new study. . “The significant age difference, however, raises the question if (privately insured) patients have better access to the healthcare system in terms of early detection of prostate cancer as compared to the Medicare patients,” Heidenreich told Reuters Health by email. . In 2002, only a fraction of patients in either group underwent laparoscopic-assisted prostate surgery, a robotic version of the surgery that uses smaller incisions and a thin camera to minimize the invasiveness of the procedure. . By 2006, 41 percent of the surgeries in the private insurance group and 35 percent of the surgeries in the Medicare group were laparoscopic, according to the results published in Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Disease.  . As robot-assisted prostate surgery became more common in both groups, hormone therapy became less common over time. . In New England, counties with more urologists per capita had lower rates of radical prostatectomy and hormone therapy, and areas with more radiation oncologists had higher rates of radiation therapy. This physician-density pattern was not seen in California or Florida, however. . In each state, Cary noted, there was considerable variation in treatments even between counties. “These counties could be bordering one another and yet the proportion receiving radiation could be between 20 to 50 percent higher in one of the counties compared to the other,” he said.  . Although insurance reimbursement was not included in the study, it may unfortunately explain some of the local and regional variation, he said. Presumably, treatments with higher reimbursements would be more common. . “Different treatments would certainly have the possibility to yield various outcomes,” Cary said, although the study did not include that information. Because they didn’t have information about the men’s tumor characteristics, the study team can’t say whether the changes over time or by region are necessarily for the better or worse. . “Variations do exist, but this doesn’t necessarily equate to inappropriate care,” he said.  . “Patients should largely rely on their treating physicians for treatment advice,” Cary said. “Patients may consider seeking second opinions from high-volume centers which may include their local academic medical centers that have experience with all treatment options and can report their own tracked outcomes.” .

|(Reuters) - Akorn Inc announced a policy to prevent the use of its drugs in state executions in response to a call by shareholder New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third-largest public pension fund in the United States. . The company said it would restrict the sale of components of lethal injection to a select group of wholesalers who agree to keep these products out of correctional institutions. . Akorn said it adopted a policy earlier this year to not accept direct orders from prison systems. . Shares of Akorn, which makes versions of sedative midazolam and painkiller hydromorphone hydrochloride, rose as much as 6 percent on Wednesday.  . A combination of the two drugs has been used in executions, including the botched executions in states such as Ohio and Arizona. . Reports of lethal injections going awry have increased scrutiny over the sale of drugs for potential use in executions. . New York State Common Retirement Fund, which held about 0.3 percent in Akorn as of Dec. 31, had urged the company to detail its stance on supply of drugs for state executions at its annual meeting in spring. . New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has also asked Mylan Inc for its stance on the issue.  . Akorn’s shares closed 3.8 percent higher at $51.19 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq.  |Wed Mar 04 21:59:08 +0000 2015||Akorn details policy to prevent use of its drugs in state executions |5.73241290793599e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWdU9R
|GENEVA (Reuters) - Guinea and Sierra Leone reported 132 new confirmed cases of Ebola in the week to March 1, an increase of 34 over the previous week, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . Liberia did not report any new confirmed infections in the week for the first time since May last year, but disease surveillance may not be optimal given the low number of samples, the U.N. agency said in its latest update on West Africa’s epidemic.  . The WHO pointed to signs that communities were still resisting bringing infected family members to treatment centers.  . Only half of the 51 new infections in Guinea came from registered contacts of Ebola patients and some cases are only identified after post-mortem testing, it said.  . The deadly virus is still widespread in Sierra Leone, which recorded 81 new cases, including 26 in the capital Freetown. . “The number of confirmed Ebola virus disease deaths occurring in the community in Guinea and Sierra Leone remains high, suggesting that the need for early isolation and treatment is not yet understood, accepted or acted upon,” the WHO said in a statement.  . “Unsafe burials continue to occur, with 16 reports of unsafe burials in both Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively,” it said. . In all, more than 23,900 confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola have been reported since the outbreak began in December 2013, including some 9,800 deaths, it said. Nearly 500 health workers have been among the fatalities. |Wed Mar 04 20:47:02 +0000 2015||Guinea, Sierra Leone report rise in Ebola in past week, no case in Liberia: WHO |5.7322314685947085e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cxt0EI
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - More than two thirds of U.S. adults, including a majority of smokers, support raising the legal age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21, according to a 2013 survey. . Many municipalities nationwide, including 30 communities in Massachusetts alone, the Big Island of Hawaii and New York City, have passed laws banning sales to people under age 21 in recent years. As of January, 2015, that includes 49 cities in seven states covering 11.5 million people, according to an author of the new study. . “Our surveys have found that the American public strongly supports tobacco policies such as those that restrict where people can smoke and that raise tobacco taxes, so we were not so much surprised to find that most adults overall supported raising the age of sale to 21, but were interested to find both the majority of smokers and of adults ages 18-20 supported raising the age of sale,” Dr. Robert C. McMillen told Reuters Health by email. . McMillen, of the American Academy of Pediatrics and Mississippi State University in Starkville, and his coauthors used the 2013 results from the annual Social Climate Survey of Tobacco Control, which included responses from more than 3,000 randomly selected adults representative of the national population. . Respondents chose a level of agreement with the statement “The age to buy tobacco should be raised to 21.” They also answered questions about their own current and former smoking status. . Slightly more than 70 percent of adults supported or strongly supported raising the tobacco purchasing age, including 57 percent of current smokers. Most people, regardless of smoking status, age, geographic location, race, sex or education level supported the statement, according to the results in Tobacco Control. . “While implemented tobacco control measures often are widely supported in the population, it is more unusual for initiatives in-the-making to be associated with support this high,” said Gunnar Sæbø, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research in Oslo who was not part of the new study. . More than 68 percent of white respondents supported the statement, as did 72 percent of Hispanic respondents and 80 percent of black respondents. . Among smokers, those who had started between age 18 and 20 were most likely to support raising the tobacco age. Only 14 people in the survey were identified as current smokers under age 21, and only one supported raising the legal smoking age.  . The legal age to purchase tobacco is regulated by states, not at the federal level.  . “Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, allow municipalities to raise the age of sale, whereas other states preempt that capacity and the action would have to be at the state level,” McMillen said. . As this is a new initiative, there hasn’t been much research on how it may affect the number of eventual smokers in the U.S., said Diana Silver, associate professor of public health at the NYU Steinhart school in New York. . “However, given the evidence that many underage smokers get their cigarettes from friends or others, efforts to restrict access to those 21 and older may make it much more difficult for 16 and 17 year olds to find a regular source of cigarettes,” she told Reuters Health by email. . “There hasn’t been a lot of research about the rigor and depth of enforcement of these laws, and there needs to be,” said Silver, who was not involved in the study. “Without it, we can’t know what contribution these laws can make.” . Needham, Massachusetts raised the age of sale to 21 in 2005, and the resulting drop in teen smokers has been encouraging, McMillen said. . “Surveys of Boston suburbs conducted between 2006 and 2010 found that cigarette smoking by Needham High School students had dropped by more than half while the surrounding suburbs fell only slightly,” he said. .

Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday swiftly approved a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co drug that helps the immune system fight the most common form of lung cancer, sending the company’s shares up more than 5 percent to a multi-year high. . The eagerly anticipated Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug known as Opdivo came only about three months after Bristol provided trial results showing that the medicine extended survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the biggest markets in oncology. The decision also came more than three months ahead of an expected action date by the agency. . “This approval will provide patients and health care providers knowledge of the survival advantage associated with Opdivo and will help guide patient care and future lung cancer trials,” Richard Pazdur, the FDA’s head of hematology and oncology product evaluation, said in a statement. . Opdivo, known chemically as nivolumab, was approved to  treat non-small cell lung cancer after the disease has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy, typically the first-line treatment against the disease. It was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. . Opdivo belongs to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells. . Opdivo was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs the agency believes would provide significant improvement in treating a serious condition. . Analysts believe lung cancer could add billions of dollars in annual sales for Opdivo.   . Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 224,210 new cases and 159,260 deaths in 2014. Non-small cell lung cancer is by far the most common type of the disease. . Bristol-Myers shares were up 5.3 percent at $65.22 on the New York Stock Exchange, a level last reached in 2001. |Wed Mar 04 19:39:32 +0000 2015||U.S. FDA approves Bristol-Myers immunotherapy for lung cancer |5.7320615667348685e+17|http://reut.rs/1CxcCnJ
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - There’s no single trick for getting toddlers and preschoolers to nap, and it’s possible that some children who resist sleeping during the day are getting all the rest they need at night.  . Tackling a topic that has long baffled parents of young children, a team of Australian researchers reviewed 26 previously published studies on how naps impact sleep at night, as well as learning and behavior during the day. It may come as no surprise to parents that researchers found little consensus beyond the fact that after age two, kids who nap may not sleep as much at night.  . “The study doesn’t imply you shouldn’t let your kids nap,” said Jodi Mindell, associate director of the sleep center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “There are only so many hours a day that you can sleep, but that doesn’t mean that napping leads to poor sleep.”  . By age two, many children should be sleeping during the night for about 10 to 11 hours, and getting about one to three hours during the day, said Mindell, who wasn’t involved in the study. . Children who take long naps, and still have no difficulty falling asleep at bedtime or waking up on their own in the morning, are probably getting the right amount of rest, she said. . Several of the studies the Australian researchers reviewed focused on the relationship between naps and sleep at night. The analysis found links between naps and later bedtimes, shorter periods of sleep at night, and waking up more often during the night.  . One study of kindergarten students who had an optional nap period found that kids went to bed later after a nap than without a nap during the day. . The relationship between napping and developmental outcomes is less clear, the study team writes in the Archives of Disease in Childhood.  . Some studies suggested that napping aided language learning, but others found the opposite.  . Anxiety and worry appeared more common in children who didn’t nap, some studies found, but other research suggested a link between longer naps and children acting more withdrawn or depressed.  . None of the studies can prove cause and effect, however. Because they were “observational” in design, and didn’t randomize groups of children to take or skip naps, more experiments are still needed to understand how naps impact sleep and development, the researchers note.  . A lot of the studies were also based on observation at a single point in time, said Dr. Judith Owens, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children’s Hospital, “so you don’t know if the kids stopped napping because they’re getting more sleep at night or if you had a child who was a regular napper and you suddenly took the nap away before they were ready.”  . When it comes to naps, parents shouldn’t focus so much on the numbers, said Owens, who wasn’t involved in the new study. Instead, they should pay attention to how their child behaves. . If for example, your child sleeps 10 hours during the week and 11 hours on the weekends, that probably means they aren’t getting enough sleep, Owens said. Or, if your child often nods off in the car or while watching cartoons or movies, that’s another sign they need more sleep. . A well-rested child will wake up on their own without an alarm clock, she added. . For toddlers or preschoolers who still need naps, they might need to nap earlier in the afternoon to avoid delaying bedtime at night so they get enough total hours of sleep in a 24-hour period, Owens said.  . “I encourage parents to know in general what the recommendations are for amounts of sleep for kids at different ages, but then really be cognizant of the other clues from each of their children that may tell them what approach is best,” Owens said. .

Kathryn Doyle| (Corrects attribution of paragraph 5.) . By Kathryn Doyle . (Reuters Health) - Providing no- or low-cost birth control pills over the counter may reduce costs and prevent up to a quarter of unplanned pregnancies, researchers say. . Many women would likely start using oral contraceptives if they were available with little or no up-front cost over the counter instead of with a prescription, they suggest in the journal Contraception. . “Making pills available without a prescription would remove the need for unnecessary, time-consuming and sometimes expensive visits to doctors’ offices and clinics,” wrote Diana Foster, the study’s lead author from the University of California, San Francisco, in an email to Reuters Health. . It would also allow women to avoid often monthly waits in line at the pharmacy, she said. . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about half of U.S. pregnancies are unplanned. Most occur among younger, poorer women. The primary cause is lack of access to contraception. . The researchers used computer models to analyze several studies and databases to predict how unintended pregnancy rates might change if birth control pills were available without a prescription and with little or no cost. . Currently, 30 percent of low-income women ages 15 to 44 years use birth control pills. Other contraception methods are less common, and 18 percent of these women use no contraception.  . Prescription birth control pills cost the public sector nearly $400 per woman each year. A pregnancy costs the public sector almost $3,000 from conception to the child’s second birthday, according to a 2010 study. . The authors of the new study project that 21 percent of low-income women at risk for unplanned pregnancies are very likely to use over-the-counter birth control pills, if available.  . “We estimate that up to a third of women using withdrawal as their main method and one in six women using no method would use pills if they were available without a prescription,” Foster said. . The ultimate number depends largely on cost, they say. . If there is no out-of-pocket cost, the number of women taking the pill could increase by up to 21 percent and the number a less effective contraceptive method or no method at all could decrease by more than 30 percent, preventing one in four unplanned pregnancies. . Overall, the analysis projects that making free or low-cost birth control pills available over the counter could save public insurance programs up to 10 percent and prevent up to a quarter of unplanned pregnancies. . “The cost of pregnancy-related medical care far outweighs the cost of preventing an unintended pregnancy,” Foster said.  . Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, “most insured women do have access to at least some oral contraceptive pills with no co-pay,” she said, adding that there are some exceptions. . “The pill has been around so much longer than the other birth control methods that it would be unlikely for the other methods to go over the counter until there is some experience with OTC pills first,” said senior author Dr. Daniel Grossman of Ibis Reproductive Health in Oakland, California.  . With political support building among Republicans and Democrats it may finally be the right time to actually make the Pill available over the counter, Foster said. . SOURCE: .

Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) - People with higher income and education levels are more likely to make food choices based on calorie information in restaurant menus, according to a recent study that calls for new ways of displaying the information to make a wider impact. . More than half of participants in the study of McDonald’s diners noticed menu calorie labels, but only 16 percent used the information to alter their eating habits.  . The calorie labels, which will become mandatory at the end of 2015 for large U.S. restaurant chains, are intended to help consumers make healthier choices. But past studies have produced mixed results on their effectiveness. . “We think that this inconsistency is partly because calorie menu labels do not influence all segments of the population in the same manner,” said Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, associate professor of nutrition at Arizona State University and the study’s senior author. . Ohri-Vachaspati and colleagues collected customer receipts and surveyed 329 people at 29 McDonald’s locations in and around Phoenix. Half of the restaurants were in high-income neighborhoods and half were in low-income neighborhoods. McDonald’s has been posting calorie labels on its menus since 2012. . The research team analyzed the purchases and responses to determine the total number of calories in each customer’s order and how likely customers were to notice or use the menu labels. Customers also gave information about their education level and socioeconomic status. . About 60 percent of participants said that they noticed the menus’ calorie labels, but only 16 percent reported actually using the information when choosing a food or drink order. People who did use the labels ate about 150 fewer calories than those who did not. . Only about 8 percent of people earning less than $50,000 per year used the calorie labels to choose their food. A much larger proportion of higher income people - about 1 in 4 people earning between $50,000 and $100,000 and 1 in 5 people earning over $100,000 - used the labels. . About a third of customers with a bachelor’s degree or more education used menu labels in their decisions, while only 1 in 10 people with a high school degree or less did the same. . Factors including age, sex, race and frequency of eating fast food did not significantly affect whether people noticed or used the calorie labels. . Noticing menu labels was not enough to influence the number of calories customers took in, and only people who reported using the nutrition information actually ate fewer calories, the authors note in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. . James Krieger, founding executive director of Action for Healthy Food, told Reuters Health in an email that previous studies have shown people underestimate the caloric content of their food by as much as half. . “The hope is that people will become more aware of the nutritional value and caloric content of foods available in chain restaurants and use that information to make healthier choices,” said Krieger, who was not involved in the study. . Krieger agrees with the study team that there are more and potentially better ways to present caloric information than just a number. . “There needs to be some work to figure out the best way to present this information so people can really understand it and use it,” Krieger said. . One way he proposes is a simple graphic representation, which could engage people with lower literacy and numeracy skills. He also suggested placing the information in context by indicating how many hours of exercise it would take to burn the calories. . Ohri-Vachaspati added that nutrition education needs to start early and that school-age children should be learning how to read labels. . She called for efforts by the fast-food industry and public health community to “make it easier for consumers from all income and education backgrounds to understand and use calorie menu labels.” . Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will require all restaurants and food vendors with 20 or more locations to post calorie counts on their menus by December of this year, Ohri-Vachaspati pointed out. . “People have the right to understand what food they’re buying and be able to make informed choices for their health,” Krieger said.  .

Megan Rowling|BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Deaths, economic damage and other negative impacts from disasters have caused losses equivalent to 42 million life years annually since 1980, a measure that is comparable to the burden of tuberculosis worldwide, the United Nations said.  . More than 90 percent of the total “years” lost in disasters between 1980 and 2012 were in low and middle-income countries, representing a serious setback to their development, the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) said.  . “If these figures show that disaster loss is as much a critical global challenge to economic development and social progress as is disease, they also show that it is a challenge unequally shared,” the UNISDR said in a report on Wednesday. . Bina Desai, UNISDR policy and research coordinator, referred to the number of years lost due to disaster-related deaths, injuries, economic damage and other losses as an “opportunity cost”. . “It is lost time that could otherwise be invested in development and social progress,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . In particular, risk from recurring, smaller disasters rather than huge one-off events drives poverty through destruction of homes, water supplies, infrastructure, and health and education facilities, the report said.  . Yet 10 years after governments signed up to a global plan to tackle disasters, known as the Hyogo Framework for Action, disaster risk “has not been reduced significantly”, it said. . “We are playing with fire,” said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a statement.  . “There is a very real possibility that disaster risk, fueled by climate change, will reach a tipping point beyond which the effort and resources necessary to reduce it will exceed the capacity of future generations.”  . Governments will meet in Japan from March 14 to 18 to adopt an updated version of the framework, still being negotiated. . Disaster risk is already making it hard for many countries to afford the capital investment and social spending they need to develop sustainably, the report said.  . Growing global inequality, increasing hazard exposure, rapid urbanization and overconsumption of energy and natural resources threaten to drive risk to dangerous and unpredictable levels with systemic global impacts, it warned. . Expected losses from disasters caused by earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones and river flooding worldwide are estimated at $314 billion per year, or almost $70 for each person of working age, according to the report.  . This includes only damage to commercial and residential properties, schools and hospitals, Desai said. The figure would be even higher if it included other hazards such as drought, and other sectors like utilities and agriculture.  . “This is not what will happen in terms of losses on an annual basis - it is what countries should prepare for,” Desai said. “But you can reduce these risk levels.” . Global annual investment of $6 billion in managing disaster risk - only 0.1 percent of the $6 trillion per year that will be required to build infrastructure over the next 15 years - would result in total avoided losses of $360 billion, the report said. . “For many countries, that small additional investment could make a crucial difference in achieving the national and international goals of ending poverty, improving health and education, and ensuring sustainable and equitable growth,” it added. . Measures to reduce the risk of disasters include rules that strengthen buildings and prevent construction on floodplains, urban drainage, early warning systems and insurance schemes for small farmers. |Wed Mar 04 16:23:47 +0000 2015||Disasters have same human impact as tuberculosis: U.N. |5.73156898255573e+17|http://reut.rs/1DUXePX

Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - The idea of using vaccines to fight cancer has received a shot in the arm from a $1 billion deal between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Bavarian Nordic. . The agreement gives the U.S. drugmaker an exclusive option to the Danish biotech firm’s therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine Prostvac and signals that such shots may have a bright future when combined with so-called checkpoint inhibitor drugs. . Shares in Bavarian Nordic surged 35 percent on Wednesday on news of the Bristol-Myers tie-up, under which it could receive up to $975 million, including an upfront payment of $60 million. . Unlike traditional preventative vaccines, therapeutic ones are designed for people with established disease and the aim is to boost the patient’s immune system to keep tumors at bay. . Unfortunately, they have run into problems in practice, leading to a series of failures with experimental products such as Merck KGaA’s Stimuvax and GlaxoSmithKline’s MAGE-A3. . The one vaccine to make it to market, Dendreon’s Provenge, has not been a commercial success. . But Bristol-Myers thinks vaccines, which trigger a response from the immune system’s “foot soldiers”, can play an important role when given in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, like its drug Yervoy, which take the brakes off other immune cells. . A week ago, the U.S. company and its Danish partner released early data from a study involving 30 patients showing that 20 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer remained alive 80 months after starting treatment with the most promising dose of Prostvac and Yervoy. . The idea of combining therapeutic cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors has gained traction among researchers in recent months and was a talking-point at the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress in Madrid in September. . Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan also told Reuters last year that the Swiss group, which is the world’s largest maker of cancer drugs, was exploring ways of combining its checkpoint inhibitors with cancer vaccines. . Companies including Roche, Bristol-Myers, Merck & Co and AstraZeneca are investing heavily in ways to harness the immune system against cancer as they chase an immunotherapy market that some analysts predict will eventually generate annual sales of more than $30 billion. |Wed Mar 04 16:07:42 +0000 2015||Bristol's $1 billion Bavarian deal may signal cancer vaccine revival |5.731528483950387e+17|http://reut.rs/1CwigX3
Sara Ledwith| (This February 27 story was corrected to say CFO, not CEO, in third paragraph of second section) . By Sara Ledwith and Martinne Geller . LONDON (Reuters) - Electronic cigarette firms in Italy say a new levy that doubles the price of e-liquid refills unfairly helps tobacco giants like Philip Morris International and will hurt their industry. . The tax, which was adopted in January, is set at half the rate of that on traditional cigarettes. The controversy centers on the fact that the lower rate is applied to both electronic cigarettes and to tobacco products such as Marlboro HeatSticks, which Philip Morris is launching in Italy alongside a 500 million euro ($568 million) factory investment. . E-cigarette companies say applying the discount to tobacco products is unfair, and designed to help Big Tobacco. The firms and industry experts also say the method of calculating the tax is too complicated and gives an unfair discount to Philip Morris’ products. . “It’s unjust,” said Massimiliano Mancini, president of ANAFE-Confindustria, a national trade association of e-cig and e-liquids producers. “It’s clear that this legislation has been drafted for other interests than just taxing the e-cigs.” He declined to elaborate. . Philip Morris would not comment on whether the new law gave it an advantage. “We have shared our views with the government via public hearings just like our competitors and others,” a spokesman told Reuters by email. . It pledged last year to make HeatSticks and other “reduced risk” products in a new factory in Bologna. Shortly before the plant’s inauguration, the firm’s CEO in Italy, Eugenio Sidoli, told the Senate Finance Committee that he welcomed the new tax rules, saying they would create “a certain and stable” regulatory outlook for the kind of investment his company was making. . Italy is one of the first countries to tax e-cigarettes; the European Union is considering the idea. The devices do not use tobacco, which contains hundreds of toxins, but instead heat liquids laced with nicotine. Many scientists agree the products are probably safer than conventional cigarettes. . Other new devices such as Marlboro HeatSticks do use tobacco and have not yet been tested to the same degree. Unless studies prove they are as safe as e-cigarettes, e-cig firms say, they should not be taxed at the lower rate. . In all, Italy collects around 12 billion euros a year in tobacco taxes. Philip Morris’ products account for 7.5 billion euros of that, according to the testimony Sidoli gave the Senate committee last October. . But Italy’s tobacco tax take has declined by more than 500 million euros since 2013. The government has said that’s partly due to the rise in e-cigarette sales. It began to think about taxing the devices in 2013 and initially introduced a tax that  more than tripled e-liquid prices, and also applied to batteries and chargers sold with e-cigarettes. . That tax was blocked by Italian courts as too confusing, forcing Rome to rethink its plans. But e-cigarette distributors and some big tobacco companies object to the latest scheme, too. . The drawn-out controversy has hurt the industry in Italy, e-cig backers say. While e-cigarette use has been growing globally, the number of regular “vapers” in Italy has slumped to 255,000 from almost half a million in 2013, health ministry figures show. Thousands of e-cigarette shops have closed.  . Italy’s Economy Ministry declined to comment. . Italy’s new law assumes that e-cigarettes are safer and should be taxed at a lower rate than traditional cigarettes. The e-cigarette lobby welcomes this but objects to extending that discount to other new products, such as the tobacco-based systems sold in Italy by Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which heat tobacco in pen-like devices. The Philip Morris system uses tobacco sticks that look like mini cigarettes while JTI’s system, called Ploom, uses aluminum pods filled with tobacco. . Philip Morris says HeatSticks, which it is also testing in Japan, are potentially less harmful than traditional cigarettes “because they are not intended to be lit on fire and smoked, but rather heated and vaped.” . But neither it nor JTI include health claims in their marketing for heat-not-burn products. Philip Morris expects to have more scientific evidence during the first half of this year, its CEO told analysts earlier this month. . Even so, Italian lawmakers said in the tax decree that a tax discount on such products was justified by the “absence of combustion” which gives them “minor toxicity” compared with traditional cigarettes. . Valerio Forconi, Corporate Affairs and Legal Director in the Italian branch of tobacco giant Imperial Tobacco, says the principle of the tax is wrong. . Imperial, whose subsidiary Fontem Ventures plans to launch a new e-cig model in Rome in March, does not object to the tax charge, he said, but believes it is too high compared to tobacco products. Philip Morris’ HeatSticks can be lit and smoked, according to Forconi. This makes Italy perhaps “the only country in the world” that effectively gives Philip Morris a tax discount on smoking. . Philip Morris said HeatSticks should not be lit and smoked. “If burned,” the spokesman said, “the experience would not be pleasurable.” |Wed Mar 04 15:34:07 +0000 2015||Italian e-cigarette firms say new tax benefits tobacco |5.731443984327557e+17|http://reut.rs/1DUH0X4
Lisa Baertlein|LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections, the most aggressive step by a major food company to change chicken producers’ practices in the fight against dangerous ‘superbugs.’ . The world’s biggest restaurant chain announced on Wednesday that within two years, McDonald’s USA will only buy chickens raised without antibiotics that are important to human medicine. The concern is that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald’s policy will begin at the hatchery, where chicks are sometimes injected with antibiotics while still in the shell. . “We’re listening to our customers,” Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald’s North American supply chain, told Reuters. She said the company is working with its domestic chicken suppliers, including Tyson Foods Inc, to make the transition. . Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the rate of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. . Scientists and public health experts say whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and can enable the strongest to survive and multiply. Frequent use of low-dose antibiotics, a practice used by some meat producers, can intensify that effect. The risk, they say, is that so-called superbugs might develop cross-resistance to critical, medically important antibiotics. . Superbugs are linked to an estimated 23,000 human deaths and 2 million illnesses every year in the United States, and up to $20 billion in direct healthcare costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food. . Gross said McDonald’s expects its suppliers will treat any animals that become ill, using antibiotics when prescribed. McDonald’s, however, will not buy those treated chickens, she said. . The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people.   . This may be a “tipping point for antibiotic use in the poultry industry,” said Jonathan Kaplan, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s food and agriculture program director. . “McDonald’s has so much purchasing power and brand recognition, I think we’re seeing a new industry standard here,” Kaplan said.   . “For public health, this is really a game changer,” said Gail Hansen, a senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts’ antibiotic resistance project. . There are exceptions to McDonald’s new policy. The company will buy chicken from farmers who “responsibly use” ionophores, an animal antibiotic not used in human medical treatment, Gross said. . The phase-out applies only to McDonald’s roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It currently does not affect the company’s approximately 22,000 international restaurants. . The action by McDonald’s, which has been fighting to win back diners and bolster sagging U.S. sales, is in step with consumer demand for food made with ‘clean’ and more ‘natural’ ingredients. But it falls short of similar policies at smaller  chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread Co, which ban the use of ionophores. . Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor, told Reuters in a statement it supported McDonald’s decision and that its chicken operations have reduced the use of antibiotics that are effective in humans by more than 84 percent since 2011. The company expects to continue reductions.  . A Reuters investigation last year revealed that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely fed chickens an array of antibiotics, not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives. . The Reuters report also found that low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some of Tyson’s flocks, including two internal company documents showing the use of bacitracin. Though that drug is not classified as medically important by the federal Food and Drug Administration, bacitracin is commonly used to prevent human skin infections. . Tyson said it disagreed with the findings of the Reuters investigation but has since taken further steps to reduce or halt antibiotic use, including in its chicken hatcheries. |Wed Mar 04 15:00:29 +0000 2015||Exclusive: McDonald's USA to phase out human antibiotics from chicken supply |5.7313593298089984e+17|http://reut.rs/1CvUACa

Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - Adults and children from the Americas to Western Europe and the Middle East must roughly halve the amount of sugar they consume to lower risk of obesity and tooth decay, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . New guidelines mean people should reduce the amount to less than 10 percent of their daily energy intake — or to about 50 grams or 12 teaspoons of sugar for adults, the U.N. agency said. . A cut to less than 5 percent would be even better at helping prevent chronic diseases linked to poor diets including heart disease, cancers and diabetes, it added. . “The reason we are focusing on sugar is that we really have seen the important association with weight gain and obesity is a major public health concern for many countries, an increasing concern,” the Director of WHO’s Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, Dr. Francesco Branca, told a briefing. . The WHO’s recommendations cover free sugars such as glucose and fructose, and sucrose or table sugar added to processed foods and drinks. They do not cover sugar found naturally in fresh fruit, vegetables and milk. . The current average in South America was 130 grams per adult per day, in North and Central America 95 grams, in Western Europe about 101 grams and 90 grams in the Middle East, Branca said. Equatorial and southern Africa has the lowest average of 30 grams. . “Where do we find free sugars, in reality we find them in a large number of products, in fact in the majority of products,” he added. . One can of sugar-sweetened soda contains up to 40 grams (around 10 teaspoons) of sugar, while orange and apple juices have between 24-26 grams, he said.  . “Actually it is very easy to exceed the recommendation of 12 teaspoons if you think of having maybe a bowl of breakfast cereals in the morning, then maybe you have a can of soda sometime during the day, then you have for dinner a sweetened yogurt, you are already above the 10 percent. You are already at approximately 15 teaspoons,” Branca said. . Global sugar consumption from a daily average of about 58 grams per person in 2003 to 63 grams in 2013, is up about 10 percent, according to the WHO. . The Sugar Association, a U.S. trade group, slammed the guideline, saying in a statement it used “weak and inconsistent data” to link sugar intake with chronic diseases. |Wed Mar 04 14:40:03 +0000 2015||People must cut sugar intake to fight obesity, tooth decay: WHO |5.7313078951009075e+17|http://reut.rs/1CvPAO2

Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - Many men are self-conscious about their penis size. Odds are they don’t need to be, but now there’s a chart of what’s “normal,” just in case. . This may be the most accurate estimate so far, according to Dr. Gordon Muir of King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London, coauthor of the new study. . Muir and his coauthors set out to create “nomograms” of flaccid and erect penis size measurements, excluding men with erectile dysfunction, past surgery or abnormalities.   . “The data comes from a very large number of men from the best existing studies,” Muir told Reuters Health by email. “We are particularly aware that many men with normal penis size can feel inadequate or ashamed, and this paper should allow specialists to reassure them.” . “We also hope that men may be spared unnecessary and harmful surgery, which some less reputable surgeons still promote,” he added. . Using more than 20,000 measurements of flaccid length, stretched length, erect length and flaccid and erect circumference, collected by health professionals for other studies, the researchers plotted the distribution of measurements to find the average. . The average flaccid penis was 3.58 inches long (about 9 cm) and 3.66 inches in girth, while the average erect penis was 5.16 inches long (about 13 cm) and 4.59 inches in circumference (about 11.7 cm), according to results online March 2 in BJU International. Stretched flaccid length was often very similar to erect length, the authors found, which may be good news for men and their doctors since clinical measurements of the erect penis may not be necessary. . Comparing these measures to other physical qualities, like age, body mass index or foot size, the authors found little or no association. Erect penis length and overall height did seem to be related at least somewhat, however – taller men had longer penises.  . “There is not a ‘right’ penis size for a man of any height, just a range of ‘normal,’” Muir said. “A bit like shoe size, really!” . As far as how one man compares to another, according to the distribution graphs the authors plotted, men in the 90th percentile for erect length were upwards of 5.9 inches long (about 15 cm), and some of the longest penises in the study were more than seven inches long erect (about 18 cm). . Technically, less than 1% of the male population has a “micropenis,” which in this group included men with flaccid length below 2.04 inches (about 5 cm). Other researchers have suggested that the smallest 2.2% of the population should be eligible for penile augmentation surgery, which would include those with flaccid length up to 2.36 inches (about 6 cm). . But defining “too big” or “too small” still hasn’t been firmly nailed down, Muir said. . “Many men with a 9 cm (3.54 inch) erection will have no problems having mutually satisfactory sexual relations, and few men with a longer than average penis seek medical help,” he said. “And research shows that women are rarely concerned about the penis size of their partner, rating it much less important than many other factors.” . Men may suffer psychological harm and relationship difficulties as a result of worrying about their size, and potential surgical “remedies” may be dangerous and are often unsatisfying, he said. . “We hope that these results will be of help to reputable clinicians who can use them to help reassure men with normal penis size they are indeed normal,” Muir said. “We also hope that no man will be subject to physical treatment without a clear understanding of where he sits in the normal range.” . There has been little to no similar research on discovering the “normal” for female genitalia, including vaginal capacity, he said. According to some studies, women who have reductive labiaplasty may generally be more satisfied than men who have penile enlargement surgery. . SOURCE: .   .

|LONDON (Reuters) - Adults only get flu twice a decade on average, scientists have found, suggesting that most of the coughs and colds that keep millions of people off work every year are down to other bugs. . The findings will deepen understanding about how the disease spreads, who is most at risk and how to develop and deploy vaccines to combat it, said researchers who conducted the study. . “For adults, we found that influenza infection is actually much less common than some people think. In childhood and adolescence, it’s much more common, possibly because we mix more with other people,” said Steven Riley of Imperial College London, who worked on the research. . The team analyzed blood samples from volunteers in Southern China, looking at antibody levels against nine different flu strains that circulated from 1968 to 2009. . They found that while children get flu on average every other year, flu infections became less frequent with age.  . “Flu-like illnesses” can often be caused by other viruses such as rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, the researchers said, making it tricky for people to know if they have real flu.     . As well as estimating flu’s frequency, the team, including researchers from Britain, the United States and China, developed a mathematical model of how immunity to flu changes over a lifetime as people encounter different virus strains. . The findings, published in the journal PLOS Biology, could help researchers and drugmakers predict how the virus will change in future and how immunity to historical strains influences the way vaccines work and how effective they will be. . “What we’ve done in this study is to analyze how a person’s immunity builds up over a lifetime of flu infections,” said Adam Kucharski, who worked on the study at Imperial before moving to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. . “This ... helps us understand the susceptibility of the population as a whole and how easy it is for new seasonal strains to spread through the population.” |Wed Mar 04 13:59:32 +0000 2015||Adults only catch flu around twice a decade, study finds |5.731205958792028e+17|http://reut.rs/1DNK6JU

|PARIS (Reuters) - Europe’s leading human right’s body, the Council of Europe, faulted France on Wednesday for failing to impose a clear ban on slapping and all other forms of corporal punishment of children. . The 47-nation organization said in a statement that French laws on smacking and punishing children were not “sufficiently clear, binding and precise”. . The Council, based in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, said it had repeatedly chided France over this matter for failing to adhere to the legally binding rules of a convention called the European Social Charter. . If France continues to fail to fall into line, it could face institutional sanctions including a ban on voting the Council’s motions, being excluded from certain committees and, theoretically, being deprived of its seat on the Council. . However, the French government said it did not see the need to introduce any legislation that would explicitly protect children. . “I consider that France today has the laws which allow it to fight against the mistreatment of children,” said Laurence Rossignol, secretary of state for the family.  . A number of European countries, such as Germany and Spain, have outlawed corporal punishment for children.  . However, many have not, and a British registered group, the Association for the Protection of All Children, complained to the Council in 2013 about seven countries — France, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Belgium. . The Council’s statement only concerned France and it was not immediately clear about the status of the other complaints. |Wed Mar 04 12:33:50 +0000 2015||France faulted by rights body over failure on child-smacking |5.73099025701974e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cvj924
|(Reuters) - Five monkeys at a high-security primate research lab in Louisiana were accidentally infected with or exposed to a deadly bacteria being analyzed at the lab, officials told Reuters on Wednesday. . A federal investigator also became sick a day after entering the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans in January and tested positive for the bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, but it was unclear whether she had been exposed to the bacteria at the center or before her visit, said Tulane spokesman Mike Strecker.  . The rhesus macaque monkeys had been housed in the veterinary clinic of the center, which is about 40 miles (65 km) north of New Orleans. Research on the bacteria, which was being done to find a vaccine, has been halted while the incident is being investigated, Strecker said.  . Health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters on Wednesday that the clinic has been decontaminated and that high-risk lab workers, veterinary staff and other personnel have tested negative for the bacteria. . Of the five monkeys, three were infected and had to be euthanized - two in November and one in December, Strecker said. . The remaining two showed antibodies that indicated they had been exposed but never had any symptoms, he said. . The investigation is focused on the veterinary clinic where all five had been treated for routine illness or injuries suffered in the breeding colony where they lived, he said.  . The bacteria can cause a disease called melioidosis in both humans and animals, which has a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other diseases like tuberculosis or pneumonia, according to the CDC. . In late January, an investigator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture became sick after having visited the center, and an antibody test indicated she had been exposed to the bacteria, Strecker said.  . The investigator, who is no longer sick, is being further tested to try to confirm the origin of the exposure, he said. It is likely that the investigator contacted the bacteria before arriving at Tulane while traveling in an area of the world where the bacteria is endemic, Strecker said.  |Wed Mar 04 12:13:32 +0000 2015||Monkeys infected after deadly bacteria escapes at Louisiana lab: USA Today |5.73093920743297e+17|http://reut.rs/1CveHjW
Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chris Barr had no problem getting his eight children exempted from vaccinations when they went to school. First in California, and later when the family moved to Arkansas, the natural healing practitioner simply signed a piece of paper stating that his personal beliefs didn’t allow the immunizations. . Such exclusions may not be so easy to obtain going forward. This year’s highly publicized measles outbreaks, which have infected more than 150 people in 17 states, are no longer front page news. But they could well have a lasting public health legacy. Already, lawmakers in at least 10 states are promoting legislation that would make exemptions far harder to obtain.  . The proposed laws have been introduced in statehouses by both Democrats and Republicans and include a range of approaches, from requiring schools to post immunization rates to entirely eliminating religious and philosophical exemptions. But they all respond to one undeniable fact: Most of the recent measles cases have been in people who were not vaccinated against the disease.  . Lawmakers say they are optimistic about the chances of the bills, though most of them aren’t far enough along in the pipeline to predict their fate. Many of the authors say the extensive coverage this year has helped their case.  . Legislators also say the laws they are proposing have received bipartisan support and that they are likely to survive consideration by legislative committees and be voted on in the coming weeks and months. In eight states, Democrats introduced the legislation, while in Texas and Vermont bills have been proposed by Republicans.     . “This is not the last outbreak we’re going to see,” said Washington Rep. June Robinson (D). “The issue will continue to be in the public conversation.”  . The year’s largest measles outbreak has been traced to Disneyland in Anaheim, California where visitors were exposed to the disease in mid-December. The vast majority of cases have been in that state, which allows both philosophical and religious exemptions.  . In all, 10 of the 17 states with reported measles cases have allowed parents to opt out of vaccines on philosophical grounds, creating a far easier way out of immunizations than states that only exempt families with extensively documented religious objections or health conditions that preclude vaccinations. Six of the 10 affected states with easy opt-out laws have proposed new legislation.    . Oregon and Washington have already held hearings on the proposed laws. But in most other states, bills have only recently been introduced or have yet to be scheduled for committee hearings.     . While nearly 80 percent of Americans believe all children should receive vaccinations, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, the proposed laws have mobilized a small but vocal community of anti-vaccine advocates who say parents should decide whether their children receive immunizations. Some of the so-called “anti-vaxers” fear vaccines may cause autism, a link scientists say has been thoroughly debunked. Others say they oppose government intrusion in parental decisions. . Several parents opposed to vaccinations testified at the Oregon and Washington hearings and larger numbers showed up last month at a Texas town hall where Rep. Jason Villalba (R) discussed a bill he introduced that would eliminate personal belief exemptions.   . In the past, local and national anti-vaccine organizations have successfully thwarted legal efforts to curb exemptions through grassroots efforts. Anti-vaxers quickly mobilized when Colorado, which permits personal and religious exemptions, introduced a measure last year that would require parents to complete an online module about immunizations or consult with a doctor before opting out. The bill passed the state’s House of Representatives but failed in the Senate after parents lobbied and testified in hearings.  . The National Vaccine Information Center, a non-profit with 37,000 subscribers to a portal that monitors all legislation concerning vaccines, has urged its members to raise their voices against this year’s crop of proposed laws, which they say could be a tougher fight because of the attention the measles outbreak has received.  . “It’s about respecting everybody’s lives,” said Barbara Lowe Fisher, the  group’s co-founder and president.  . In some states with easy exemption rules, decades-old court decisions will make changing the laws difficult, if not impossible.  . In Maryland, for example, the state’s Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that schools could not deny exemptions to parents with religious objections, saying that could lead to discrimination. The state does, however, have a law mandating vaccines in the case of a public health emergency.   . Courts in other states have decided vaccination cases differently. In 1979, for example, Mississippi’s Supreme Court upheld a vaccination requirement for school enrollment, holding that exemptions, including religious ones, put children at risk.  . Mississippi lawmakers have re-introduced legislation this year that would allow philosophical exemptions, but those efforts have been shot down several times in the past.    . Health officials and local representatives said they worry that allowing nonmedical exemptions means that some parents opt out simply because it’s easier.  . In Idaho, for example, many parents sign a personal belief waiver simply because the school has pointed out that a child is missing a required vaccine, said Tom Shanahan, public information officer for the Idaho Department of Health.  . Less than 1 percent of children in the state have received no vaccines at all, Shanahan said, but there is a 6.3 percent exemption rate across the state for one or more immunizations. Parents can use a waiver to exempt their child from some vaccinations or all of them. Idaho has not introduced legislation this year that would limit exemptions because “there’s a pretty strong culture of individual rights,” Shanahan said.   . And even if they are passed, stronger laws may not convince parents who oppose vaccines to immunize their children. One pediatric nurse practitioner, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution at work, said she has decided to home-school her four-year-old son after a Brooklyn school denied her repeated appeals to exempt him from his hepatitis B and flu shots. . “It’s completely unfair and it’s ridiculous and a violation of the Constitution,” the nurse practitioner said.  .

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. Supreme Court takes on a make-or-break Obamacare case this week, a growing number of U.S. patients and their doctors are already devising a Plan B in case they lose medical coverage. . The Court’s ruling, expected by late June, will determine whether millions of Americans will keep receiving federal subsidies to help them pay for private health insurance under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. . The White House, which said it is confident the justices will rule in favor of the subsidies that are a key element of Obamacare, said it has no immediate fix if the decision goes the other way. . But even physicians who think the court will uphold the subsidies are gearing up for the worst.  . Worried about newly-insured patients such as those who have just begun treatment for cancer or other serious illnesses, they are dusting off playbooks they retired when Obamacare slashed the number of uninsured people. . Interviews with doctors reached through professional groups show that they are lining up free clinics to care for patients with chronic illnesses, asking pharmaceutical companies to provide discounted drugs, and moving up preventive-care appointments and complicated procedures. . “We have to be able to navigate this on behalf of our patients if it comes about,” said Dr. Jeff Huebner, a family physician in Madison, Wisconsin, one of the affected states.  . In King v. Burwell, the Court will decide whether the Affordable Care Act permits government subsidies for citizens of at least 34 states which use the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace to buy health insurance. It will hear oral arguments on Wednesday. . If the justices rule that only residents of states running their own exchanges are eligible for subsidies, some 9.3 million people will have to pay their full monthly premium or lose coverage, estimates the nonpartisan Urban Institute. About 6 million are expected to be unable to afford it. . Many providers as well as patients are unaware of the looming threat, but some physicians are already preparing for it. . Last weekend, leaders of the National Physicians Alliance, which supports the Affordable Care Act and works to improve access to medical care, met in Washington to discuss how to work with community organizations to arrange healthcare for people who might become uninsured, said Huebner, who chairs the group’s policy committee. . “The ideas include finding organizations that make referrals to free clinics, encouraging patients to check if they qualify for Medicaid or other state programs, and if they can’t get insurance then find a regular source of care that accepts payment on a sliding scale” based on ability to pay, Huebner said. . He and other physicians are also scheduling Obamacare patients for preventive screenings, completing lab work, and writing prescription refills. . “I would advise patients in this boat to schedule a visit with their primary care provider as soon as they can” to set up “transition plans,” Huebner said. . If the court rules against the administration, premium subsidies for people in the affected states could end immediately, though insurers would be obliged to give 90 days notice before ending coverage, according to Aetna Inc. chief executive Mark Bertolini. None of the affected states have announced contingency plans, but some are considering alternatives to help residents maintain coverage.. . In Brewton, Alabama, pediatrician Marsha Raulerson has persuaded one drug company to provide an expensive asthma medication to one of her patients if she loses her insurance. . “But after a few months you have to re-apply” and show that the patient is still unable to afford medication, Raulerson said. “It’s not an easy process, especially if you have to do it for a lot of patients.” She is also stockpiling as many free samples as she can. . Dr. Robert Wergin, a primary care physician in Milford, Nebraska, is scrambling to locate labs and imaging centers that offer the lowest prices for blood tests, X-rays and MRIs. . “Around here, people feel responsible for their bills and I’m not sure they would come in if they lost insurance and couldn’t pay,” Wergin said.  . Some patients, reached through social service organizations that helped them sign up for Obamacare, are aware of the potential loss of subsidies and are trying to schedule medical procedures before the Court rules. . Yolanda Diaz, 27, is one of them. A single mother of two, she suffers from occasional blackouts that last several minutes. She cannot afford the full premium on her wages as a pantry manager at Brevard County, Florida, community center so she pays $74.95 a month and the rest is covered by a $205 Obamacare subsidy.  . Her coverage began this month, Diaz said, and the first thing she did was make appointments for an MRI and CT scans in hopes of identifying the cause of the blackouts. . “I would hate to have to go to the ER, but if the subsidies get taken away I don’t know what I’ll do,” she said. U.S. law requires hospitals to treat all emergency cases regardless of ability to pay, so many uninsured patients seek care there. . Of those expected to be priced out of insurance in case of unfavorable ruling, the Urban Institute estimated 81 percent are, like Diaz, employed full- or part-time. . So is Theresa Cabot-Walmer. The 58-year-old Pennsylvanian pays $79 a month and receives a subsidy of about $400. On her 5-hours-a-day job as a shipping clerk she could never afford the full premium, she said. . Her coverage has allowed her to see a physical therapist for a serious knee injury and avoid a knee-replacement surgery. . If the Court eliminates subsidies, she plans to ask if the therapist will accept lower payments. But because that is not a sure thing, Cabot-Walmer is considering her plan B. . “I might try to schedule knee-replacement surgery while I still have insurance.” |Wed Mar 04 06:22:29 +0000 2015||Doctors, patients scramble ahead of high court Obamacare decision |5.7300557550576845e+17|http://reut.rs/1CtZqQx
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists who analyzed countless chemicals in spider venom say they have identified seven compounds that block a key step in the body’s ability to pass pain signals to the brain. . In research they said could one day lead to a new class of potent painkillers, the scientists focused on 206 species of spider and searched for molecules in the venom that block nerve activity, particular via so-called “Nav1.7 channels”. . Experts estimate that as many as one in five people worldwide suffer from chronic pain and existing pain treatments often fail to give sufficient or long-term relief. Pain’s economic burden is also huge, with chronic pain estimated to cost $600 billion a year in the United States alone. . People sense pain in a part of their body when nerves from the affected area send signals to the brain through what is called the pain pathway, and it is this pathway scientists seek to disrupt when searching for potential new pain medicines.  . “A compound that blocks Nav1.7 channels is of particular interest,” said Glenn King, who led the study at Australia’s University of Queensland.  . He said previous research has found indifference to pain among people who lack Nav1.7 channels due to a naturally-occurring genetic mutation, so blocking these channels has the potential to turn off pain in people with normal pathways. . Part of the search for new pain killing drugs has focused on the world’s 45,000 species of spiders, many of which kill their prey with venoms that contain hundreds and even thousands of protein molecules, some of which block nerve activity. . “A conservative estimate indicates that there are nine million spider-venom peptides, and only 0.01 percent of this vast pharmacological landscape has been explored so far,” said Julie Kaae Klint, who worked with King on the study. . The researchers, whose work was published on Thursday in the British Journal of Pharmacology, built a system that could rapidly analyze spider venom compounds. They screened venoms from 206 species and found that 40 percent contained at least one compound that blocked human Nav1.7 channels. . Of the seven promising compounds they identified, they said one was particularly potent and also had a chemical structure that suggested it would have the kind of chemical, thermal and biological stability needed for making a drug.  . “Untapping this natural source of new medicines brings a distinct hope of accelerating the development of a new class of painkillers,” said Klint.  |Wed Mar 04 05:14:59 +0000 2015||Spider venom may hold chemical keys to new painkillers |5.729885871275131e+17|http://reut.rs/1DKiJQO
Adrian Croft|BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The three West African states hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak asked for help from donors on Tuesday to repair the damage to their economies now that the epidemic seems to be waning. . Leaders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone voiced confidence at a major international conference on the Ebola outbreak in Brussels that they were winning the battle but said they must remain focused on stamping out new infections. . The epidemic has killed around 10,000 people in the three countries and delivered a severe setback to their economies, which had previously been performing well. . “Victory against the virus is in sight but we must guard against complacency. There will not be total victory until we get to a resilient zero (new cases) in the three most affected countries,” Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma told the conference. . Ebola cases have declined sharply in recent weeks, but there has been a worrying recent surge in new infections in Sierra Leone, where Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana put himself in quarantine after one of his bodyguards died of Ebola. . “It’s easier to go from 100 (cases) to 10 than from 10 to zero,” Guinea’s President Alpha Conde said. . International donors have pledged nearly $5 billion to help combat the Ebola outbreak, according to EU officials, although only about half of that has been disbursed so far. . Schools, farms and markets closed during the outbreak, casting a chill on business as investors left and government finances weakened. A fall in global commodity prices compounded the region’s problems. . The World Bank has estimated the epidemic will cost the three countries at least $1.6 billion in lost economic growth this year, or more than 12 percent of their combined output. . Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf said the three countries believed a regional approach to recovery was best. . “This can only be achieved with your support,” she told the conference, which brought together 600 delegates from around the world. . “There is no doubt this will require significant resources, perhaps even a Marshall plan,” she said, referring to the large U.S. aid program to rebuild Europe after World War Two. . The three African nations aim to draw up a regional recovery plan to present at the April meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Johnson-Sirleaf said. . No new aid pledges were expected at the Brussels conference. . Koroma said Sierra Leone was looking for debt relief, grants and concessionary loans and was seeking support to rebuild social services and to revamp the private sector. |Wed Mar 04 01:50:08 +0000 2015||Ebola-hit countries seek help to repair their economies |5.7293703407303885e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ct8Jjv
Courtney Sherwood|PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - A spike in syphilis cases in Portland in the past three years has prompted concerned public health officials to urge more sexually active adults to get tested regularly for the treatable bacterial infection. . The Portland metro area has seen about 240 new cases of the disease on average each year since 2012, many times more than the 10 to 30 cases that were detected annually before that. . Across the country, incidences of syphilis are on the rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last year the number of infections in the United States climbed by more than 10 percent in 2013 to 17,535 cases, compared with the previous year. . “Nationally there’s been an increase in syphilis diagnoses but our increase has exceeded the national average,” Kim Toevs, a senior manager with the Multnomah County Health Department, said on Tuesday.  . Health officials in Oregon’s biggest city asked the CDC for help last year, she said, and it enlisted social and behavioral scientists, as well as public health physicians, to study what caused the increase.  . Toevs said the team found that some groups of sexually active gay and bisexual men had become less vigilant about condom use as fears about HIV transmission waned, and as many people diagnosed with HIV began increasingly to receive medication that reduces the risk of transmitting that virus. . “We’ve also found a link to the increase of social media applications used to meet people online, (which is) true among heterosexuals and gays both,” Toevs said.  . “The more points of connection with strangers they didn’t know before, the more pathways there are to spread.” . Toevs urged gay and bisexual men who have more than one partner to get tested for syphilis every three months.  . “Folks who are not at quite that risk should still test at least once a year,” she said. . Syphilis can be cured with penicillin but if left untreated can cause blindness, hearing loss, neurological damage and birth defects in children born to affected mothers.  . Half of the men with syphilis nationwide also are infected with HIV, according to the CDC. |Wed Mar 04 01:09:36 +0000 2015||Officials urge testing as Portland, Oregon sees rise in syphilis cases |5.729268329341952e+17|http://reut.rs/1DIN2Yd
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Big breakfasts and small dinners might be a healthier way to eat for people with type 2 diabetes, according to a small new study. . Diabetics in the study who ate big breakfasts and small dinners had fewer episodes of high blood sugar than those who ate small breakfasts and large dinners, researchers found. . Blood sugar – also known as blood glucose – is controlled by the body’s internal clock, with larger blood sugar peaks after evening meals, Dr. Daniela Jakubowicz told Reuters Health in an email. . People with type 2 diabetes often time their meals in opposition to their internal clock, said Jakubowicz, a researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Wolfson Medical Center in Israel. . “They frequently skip breakfast while eating a high-calorie dinner,” she said, adding that skipping breakfast is linked to obesity and poor blood sugar control. . The new study involved eight men and ten women with type 2 diabetes, ages 30 to 70, who were being treated with either the diabetes drug metformin and dietary advice or diet advice alone. . Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes and is often linked to obesity. In type 2 diabetes, the body’s cells are resistant to the hormone insulin, or the body doesn’t make enough of it. Insulin gives blood sugar access to the body’s cells to be used as fuel. . The participants were randomly assigned to follow a meal plan that consisted of either a 700-calorie breakfast and 200-calorie dinner or a 200-calorie breakfast and a 700-calorie dinner. Both diets included a 600-calorie lunch. . After following the assigned meal plans for six days at home, the participants spent a day at the clinic, where blood tests were taken. They repeated the experiment two weeks later with the other diet plan. . The study team found that post-meal glucose levels were 20 percent lower, and levels of insulin were 20 percent higher, when the participants consumed the large breakfasts and small dinners, according to the results in Diabetologia. . “Our study demonstrated that a large breakfast and reduced dinner is a beneficial alternative for the management of glucose balance during the day and should be considered as a therapeutic strategy in type 2 diabetes,” Jakubowicz said. . Jakubowicz said longer studies are needed to see if the benefits would continue over time. . The new results support the advice to eat like a king at breakfast, a prince at lunch and a pauper at dinner, said Anna Taylor in an email to Reuters Health. . “Select your calories with care, however; what you eat, how you eat, and when you eat all play an important role in your nutrition as well as your health,” said Taylor, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. She wasn’t involved in the study. . She added that it’s important for people to keep in mind that the study’s participants took few medications and had no major complications.  . The results might therefore not apply to other groups with diabetes, Taylor said. . She said that people with diabetes who take insulin should speak to their endocrinologists before experimenting with drastic dietary adjustments. . SOURCE: (PDF link) .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - More than half of people born after 1960 in the U.K. may be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetimes, a new estimate suggests. . While the prediction seems alarming, the researchers say  the increase is partly due to people living longer overall. . “Everyone has to die of something and the longer people live the more likely that they will have previously been treated for a serious illness,” wrote Peter Sasieni, the study’s senior researcher from Queen Mary University of London, in an email to Reuters Health. . As reported in the British Journal of Cancer, he and his coauthors estimated the lifetime risk of cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, in Britain for men and women born from 1930 to 1960.  . They used data on all causes of death in the UK from 1951 through 2012 and projected causes of death from 2013 to 2060, as well as data on the number of cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths from 1971 to 2009. . For men, lifetime cancer risk rose from about 39 percent for those born in 1930 to about 54 percent for those born in 1960. Risk increased similarly for women, from about 37 percent to about 48 percent. . “I was surprised when I first calculated that the risk was just over 50 percent for people born in 1960,” Sasieni said. . Along with modifiable risk factors for cancer, such as obesity, he said people are more likely to develop cancer the longer they live. . “As we become better at avoiding dying from infections, heart disease, stroke and even road accidents so we are more likely to live long enough to get cancer,” Sasieni said. . These are actually positive results, agreed Dr. Freddie Bray of the Cancer Surveillance Section at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France. . “Rather little of the risk is due to an increasing cancer risk in the population,” Bray, who was not involved with the new study, told Reuters Health by email. . Also, more than half the lifetime risk for people born in 1960 comes from cancer diagnosed after age 70. In their model, almost 90 percent of men born in 1960 would be diagnosed with cancer by age 120, hypothetically, if they did not die of other causes first. . Additionally, screening tests for breast and prostate cancer catch many more cases of the disease than would have been diagnosed previously, Sasieni said. . He suspects the trends would be similar in North America, Western Europe and Australia. . SOURCE: .

|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked makers of prescription testosterone therapies to change their labeling to clarify that their products are approved only for men with specific medical conditions and could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. . Prescriptions for low testosterone, or “Low T” have soared over the past decade, driven by a surge in use by men facing falling testosterone levels as they age. . The number of men being prescribed testosterone jumped more than 75 percent, to 2.3 million, between 2009 and 2013. About 70 percent of these patients were between the ages of 40 and 64, the FDA said. . Tuesday’s ruling restricts companies from marketing or promoting their products for age-related low testosterone.  . The agency’s announcement takes on board most of the recommendations of an independent advisory panel, which voted in September to endorse restricting the use of these treatments to men with medical conditions, such as genetic disorders or tumors, that impair testicular function. . The FDA has also asked manufacturers of approved products, including skin patches, solutions, intramuscular injections and topical gels, to conduct studies to determine whether the treatments raise cardiovascular risk. . Last year, the Canadian health regulator issued a similar warning of possible serious and life-threatening cardiovascular problems associated with these therapies. . AbbVie Inc’s AndroGel, one of the most widely-used products, raked in sales of $934 million in 2014. Other products include Endo International Plc’s Testim and Eli Lilly & Co’s Axiron. . A number of drugmakers, including Antares Pharma Inc, Repros Therapeutics Inc and Lipocine Inc, are currently developing their own low T treatments. . Last year, the agency mandated that manufacturers must include a warning about the risk of blood clots in the veins on their product labels.  . Symptoms of low testosterone include loss of libido, decreased muscle mass, fatigue and depression. |Tue Mar 03 23:05:48 +0000 2015||FDA limits use of testosterone drugs, warns of possible heart risk |5.7289568044180685e+17|http://reut.rs/1Csixu8
Sarah N. Lynch|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s top enforcement chief warned on Tuesday that too many pharmaceutical companies are failing to accurately portray their dealings with federal drug regulators - a problem that could get them in trouble. . Andrew Ceresney, the SEC’s enforcement director, said the agency has seen a lot of problems with disclosures by pharmaceutical companies, including on 8-Ks - a form companies file when they need to disclose an event that is “material” to their business. . “One significant type of key event that we see causing problems with disclosure in your industry is disclosures on your dealings with the (Food and Drug Administration),” Ceresney said in prepared remarks at a conference held by the Annual Pharmaceutical Compliance Congress.  . “Accuracy of reporting in your dealings with the FDA is critical to getting investors the information they need. FDA dealings and approvals are the lifeblood of your business and are so important to investment decisions,” he added. . Ceresney said the SEC has taken a number of enforcement actions in recent years against companies for problematic disclosures tied to FDA approvals. . One case involved executives at the biopharmaceutical company Immunosyn Corporation [IMYN.PK]. The SEC alleged that executives mislead investors about the regulatory status of the company’s goat blood-derived drug. . Another case, he said, was brought against Imaging3 Inc and its chief executive officer for misleading investors in a conference call about FDA approval for its medical scanner. . The SEC alleged that the FDA had denied the device several times, and even called some of the images useless, but that the CEO downplayed these concerns when investors asked questions on a call. . The company later settled with the SEC and agreed to take certain remedial steps. . “The message from these cases is that you need to be completely accurate in recounting your dealings with the FDA,” Ceresney said. “So much turns on those interactions and not being straight with investors will have significant consequences.” |Tue Mar 03 23:05:48 +0000 2015||SEC warns pharma companies to be honest about FDA correspondence |5.728956786801746e+17|http://reut.rs/1DI3p7h
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Providing no- or low-cost birth control pills over the counter may reduce costs and prevent up to a quarter of unplanned pregnancies, researchers say. . Many women would likely start using oral contraceptives if they were available with little or no up-front cost over the counter instead of with a prescription, they suggest in the journal Contraception. . “Making pills available without a prescription would remove the need for unnecessary, time-consuming and sometimes expensive visits to doctors’ offices and clinics,” wrote Diana Foster, the study’s lead author from the University of California, San Francisco, in an email to Reuters Health. . It would also allow women to avoid often monthly waits in line at the pharmacy, she said. . Foster and her colleagues say about half of U.S. pregnancies are unplanned. Most occur among younger, poorer women. The primary cause is lack of access to contraception. . The researchers used computer models to analyze several studies and databases to predict how unintended pregnancy rates might change if birth control pills were available without a prescription and with little or no cost. . Currently, 30 percent of low-income women ages 15 to 44 years use birth control pills. Other contraception methods are less common, and 18 percent of these women use no contraception.  . Prescription birth control pills cost the public sector nearly $400 per woman each year. A pregnancy costs the public sector almost $3,000 from conception to the child’s second birthday, according to a 2010 study. . The authors of the new study project that 21 percent of low-income women at risk for unplanned pregnancies are very likely to use over-the-counter birth control pills, if available.  . “We estimate that up to a third of women using withdrawal as their main method and one in six women using no method would use pills if they were available without a prescription,” Foster said. . The ultimate number depends largely on cost, they say. . If there is no out-of-pocket cost, the number of women taking the pill could increase by up to 21 percent and the number a less effective contraceptive method or no method at all could decrease by more than 30 percent, preventing one in four unplanned pregnancies. . Overall, the analysis projects that making free or low-cost birth control pills available over the counter could save public insurance programs up to 10 percent and prevent up to a quarter of unplanned pregnancies. . “The cost of pregnancy-related medical care far outweighs the cost of preventing an unintended pregnancy,” Foster said.  . Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, “most insured women do have access to at least some oral contraceptive pills with no co-pay,” she said, adding that there are some exceptions. . “The pill has been around so much longer than the other birth control methods that it would be unlikely for the other methods to go over the counter until there is some experience with OTC pills first,” said senior author Dr. Daniel Grossman of Ibis Reproductive Health in Oakland, California.  . With political support building among Republicans and Democrats it may finally be the right time to actually make the Pill available over the counter, Foster said. . SOURCE: .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - For older people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, low blood pressure might be linked to faster mental decline, according to a new study. . There is not much data on blood pressure in people with cognitive impairment, lead author Dr. Enrico Mossello of the University of Florence in Italy told Reuters Health by email. . This new study, he added, is the first to suggest that cognitive declines might happen faster in older people on blood pressure medicine whose systolic pressure - the top number - is low.  . Between 2009 and 2012, Mossello and his coauthors analyzed 172 older people. Most had dementia; about a third had only mild cognitive impairment. Almost 70 percent were taking medication for high blood pressure. . The researchers recorded participants’ blood pressure and their performance on a mental test. They repeated all the measurements six to 18 months later - by which time mental function had declined for the whole group, on average, and disability had increased. . The researchers divided participants into three groups based on daytime readings of systolic blood pressure, which is the “120” of a healthy “120 over 80 millimeters of Mercury” blood pressure reading. . People in the lowest third of systolic blood pressure scores (below 128 mm Hg) had bigger decreases on their mental performance tests than those in the middle and high blood pressure groups, according to results in JAMA Internal Medicine. . When the researchers took blood pressure medications into account, only those on the medications who also had lower blood pressure experienced more cognitive decline. . Naturally low blood pressure may not be harmful, but these results suggest that excessive lowering of blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs seems to affect cognition negatively, Mossello said. . “The idea has crystallized that all high blood pressure is bad,” said Dr. Rudolf Westendorp of the faculty of health and medical sciences at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. . “The dogma is that blood pressure should always be below 140/85, but that is simply not true,” Westendorp, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the new research, told Reuters Health by email. . Frail older people experience more dizziness on standing because blood pressure drops below a minimum that keeps the brain oxygenated, he said.  . “Many have tripped or collapsed with often fatal consequences,” he said. “That’s why doctors should taper blood pressure lowering medication when older patients develop this type of symptoms and prevent these unwanted side effects.” . This does not mean that high blood pressure is better, Mossello stressed. He said patients should never stop their blood pressure medication until a doctor orders it. . “There are many dementia patients with high blood pressure, hopefully treated, who will experience blood pressure decrease in the course of the disease and need attention to have their therapy adjusted and avoid overtreatment,” Mossello said. . He emphasized that daytime blood pressure readings were more predictive than office readings. People may get nervous at doctors’ offices, which falsely increases their blood pressure readings. . “Probably systolic blood pressure values between 130 and 145 are fine for most older patients with dementia,” he added. .

Nidal al-Mughrabi|GAZA (Reuters) - In a smart building in an upscale neighborhood of Gaza City,  Salah El-Zanin is seeing a growing number of clients. Trained in Greece, he is the only plastic surgeon in Gaza with European qualifications, and his business is booming. . Some of his patients want to repair scars left by bombs and bullets; others are young men and women seeking everything from nose jobs to breast enlargements. . “Women are all the same everywhere,” said Zanin, who has been practicing for 30 years and whose three-room clinic is bedecked with certificates announcing his qualifications. “They may speak different languages, but they all have the same desires and needs about beauty and life.” . In a conservative society such as Gaza, where the Islamist group Hamas has held sway since 2007, it is hard to pin down how widespread plastic surgery is becoming. But Zanin says three years ago he might have seen a couple of patients a day, and now he sees up to 15. . In his reception hall one recent morning, eight men and women were waiting for their appointments. Some have suffered disfiguring injuries from the wars Israel and Hamas have fought in Gaza since 2008. Others might want anything from botox injections to liposuction to nose and breast operations. . “When a man or a woman has a big nose, that is ugly,” he said. “When we do it for them, they will look better and handsome and as a result they will feel better.” . Gaza, home to 1.8 million people, has an unemployment rate of 45 percent and a per capita income of just $950 a year. It is a wonder residents can afford to spend what little they have on cosmetic operations.  . But Zanin said the desire for a better appearance was universal, even if Gazans were initially reluctant. He declined to say how much his treatments cost, but said they were less expensive than anywhere else in the world. . “The beginning was difficult, the issue of trust, people’s fears toward cosmetic surgery and the fact that they did not know me,” he said. Now, his popularity means he is regularly importing new equipment from Europe to keep up with demand. . Zanin says he doesn’t carry out operations that contravene religious practices and makes sure that husbands are aware and involved when it comes to their wives’ treatments. . Mohammed, who was wounded in last year’s war between Hamas and Israel, has received treatment for painful nerve damage in his legs after losing a large amount of flesh. Two months on, he says the legs look better and the pain has gone. . Those waiting to see Zanin this week did not want to speak about their cosmetic surgery plans, but one woman who recently underwent a breast enlargement at his clinic pronounced herself very pleased with the results. . “I feel more confident in myself now,” she said. “I smile when I look at myself in the mirror.”|Tue Mar 03 19:18:15 +0000 2015||In Gaza, demand grows for a plastic surgeon's services |5.728384158861066e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cr2lcE
Misha Hussain|MELIANDOU, Guinea (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A charred kapok tree and around a dozen graves scattered amongst the mud brick houses of Meliandou are painful reminders of the toll Ebola has taken on this village in southeast Guinea. . Scientists traced the source of the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola to two-year-old Emile Ouamouno, who they believe contracted the disease while playing near the tree, home to hundreds of bats that may have been hosting the deadly virus. . The boy’s father, Etienne Ouamouno, said Emile fell ill in December 2013, and infected his sister and mother who was eight months pregnant at the time. Over a year later, having lost all his immediate family, Etienne Ouamouno has difficulty in finding words to describe his grief. . For now, his body language does the talking. . Sitting at the foot of the kapok tree, which has since been set alight by the villagers to smoke out all the bats, Ouamouno nervously lights up a cigarette and takes a number of short drags in quick succession before flicking off the ash. . There is a long, uncomfortable silence as he contemplates the significance of this spot. Almost 24,000 people mainly in hardest-hit Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, have been infected and some 9,700 have died from Ebola as a result of the chain of transmission that started here. . “It wasn’t Emile that started it,” Ouamouno finally says in Kissi, the local language. “Emile was too young to eat bats, and he was too small to be playing in the bush all on his own. He was always with his mother.”  . For Ouamouno and thousands of others in the forest region of southeastern Guinea, once the breadbasket of the West African nation, the suffering has only deepened. Ebola has left them scared, frustrated and jobless.  . “There’s food on the market, but not enough money to buy it. Around 100,000 people are out of work since the mining companies closed due to Ebola,” said Jean-Luc Siblot, emergency coordinator for the World Food Programme (WFP) in Guinea. . “Closures of borders with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Mali and the lack of willingness for food transporters to come into the region meant agricultural collectives were stuck with their products,” Siblot told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . Jobs have dried up in 91 percent of the communities surveyed by WFP in the forest region. Farmers in other parts of the country say up to 50 percent of their crop has spoiled because they could not be sold across borders. . WFP estimates that up to 1 million people do not get three meals a day and many have to sell their assets to buy food. Ebola has made this worse.  . Since September, WFP has distributed over 15,000 tonnes of food aid to around 550,000 people in the forest region, including the prefectures of Macenta, Gueckedou and Kissidougou, where the outbreak was the most ferocious. . In the dense undergrowth around Meliandou, children pick mushrooms for dinner while their mothers make palm oil in the village courtyard. But palm oil alone will not feed the family, nor will it sell for enough to put food on the table. . “What we need right now is agricultural support. We need more classrooms, a church, and health posts staffed with doctors and equipped with medicine,” said Ouamouno, who started to open up with the encouragement of the village chief. . In January, global aid agency Oxfam called for a multi-million dollar post-Ebola “Marshall Plan” to help Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia — similar to a U.S. aid program to help rebuild shattered European economies after World War Two.  . The idea was revived on Tuesday as the leaders of the countries met international donors in Brussels to discuss their response to Ebola. . Back in Meliandou, villagers were skeptical of the government’s intentions ahead of presidential elections due later this year. . “The government has never done anything for us in the past, so why would they change now,” said Ouamouno, reflecting the view of many in this largely anti-government region of the country. |Tue Mar 03 19:02:38 +0000 2015||Hunger and frustration grow at Ebola ground zero in Guinea |5.728344852947845e+17|http://reut.rs/1DGtd3C

|DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland on Tuesday became the second country in the world to pass legislation requiring cigarettes to be sold in plain packets, despite threats of legal action by tobacco companies opposed to the move. . Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco Group have said they would take legal action against the plan to ban the colourful logos used to sell tobacco brands but the Irish government has said it plans to proceed. . The law was approved in its final reading in Ireland’s upper house of parliament on Tuesday and needs to be signed by the country’s president, widely seen as a formality.  . Under the legislation, companies would be banned from producing branded tobacco products for the Irish market from May 2016 and would be banned from selling branded tobacco products in Ireland from May 2017, a government spokesman said.   . In a response last year to Britain’s health department over its plans to introduce a similar law by May, Imperial Tobacco said plain packaging would infringe international law, could threaten future foreign direct investment into Britain and set a dangerous precedent for other sectors. . Australia introduced a similar ban in 2012 with the aim of reducing smoking and is facing challenges at the World Trade Organization which say that the law creates illegal obstacles to commerce. |Tue Mar 03 18:10:59 +0000 2015||Irish parliament passes plain tobacco packaging law |5.7282148539765965e+17|http://reut.rs/1DG7uc9
Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chris Barr had no problem getting his eight children exempted from vaccinations when they went to school. First in California, and later when the family moved to Arkansas, the natural healing practitioner simply signed a piece of paper stating that his personal beliefs didn’t allow the immunizations. . Such exclusions may not be so easy to obtain going forward. This year’s highly publicized measles outbreaks, which have infected more than 150 people in 17 states, are no longer front page news. But they could well have a lasting public health legacy. Already, lawmakers in at least 10 states are promoting legislation that would make exemptions far harder to obtain.  . The proposed laws have been introduced in statehouses by both Democrats and Republicans and include a range of approaches, from requiring schools to post immunization rates to entirely eliminating religious and philosophical exemptions. But they all respond to one undeniable fact: Most of the recent measles cases have been in people who were not vaccinated against the disease.  . Lawmakers say they are optimistic about the chances of the bills, though most of them aren’t far enough along in the pipeline to predict their fate. Many of the authors say the extensive coverage this year has helped their case.  . Legislators also say the laws they are proposing have received bipartisan support and that they are likely to survive consideration by legislative committees and be voted on in the coming weeks and months. In eight states, Democrats introduced the legislation, while in Texas and Vermont bills have been proposed by Republicans.     . “This is not the last outbreak we’re going to see,” said Washington Rep. June Robinson (D). “The issue will continue to be in the public conversation.”  . The year’s largest measles outbreak has been traced to Disneyland in Anaheim, California where visitors were exposed to the disease in mid-December. The vast majority of cases have been in that state, which allows both philosophical and religious exemptions.  . In all, 10 of the 17 states with reported measles cases have allowed parents to opt out of vaccines on philosophical grounds, creating a far easier way out of immunizations than states that only exempt families with extensively documented religious objections or health conditions that preclude vaccinations. Six of the 10 affected states with easy opt-out laws have proposed new legislation.    . Oregon and Washington have already held hearings on the proposed laws. But in most other states, bills have only recently been introduced or have yet to be scheduled for committee hearings.     . While nearly 80 percent of Americans believe all children should receive vaccinations, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, the proposed laws have mobilized a small but vocal community of anti-vaccine advocates who say parents should decide whether their children receive immunizations. Some of the so-called “anti-vaxers” fear vaccines may cause autism, a link scientists say has been thoroughly debunked. Others say they oppose government intrusion in parental decisions. . Several parents opposed to vaccinations testified at the Oregon and Washington hearings and larger numbers showed up last month at a Texas town hall where Rep. Jason Villalba (R) discussed a bill he introduced that would eliminate personal belief exemptions.   . In the past, local and national anti-vaccine organizations have successfully thwarted legal efforts to curb exemptions through grassroots efforts. Anti-vaxers quickly mobilized when Colorado, which permits personal and religious exemptions, introduced a measure last year that would require parents to complete an online module about immunizations or consult with a doctor before opting out. The bill passed the state’s House of Representatives but failed in the Senate after parents lobbied and testified in hearings.  . The National Vaccine Information Center, a non-profit with 37,000 subscribers to a portal that monitors all legislation concerning vaccines, has urged its members to raise their voices against this year’s crop of proposed laws, which they say could be a tougher fight because of the attention the measles outbreak has received.  . “It’s about respecting everybody’s lives,” said Barbara Lowe Fisher, the  group’s co-founder and president.  . In some states with easy exemption rules, decades-old court decisions will make changing the laws difficult, if not impossible.  . In Maryland, for example, the state’s Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that schools could not deny exemptions to parents with religious objections, saying that could lead to discrimination. The state does, however, have a law mandating vaccines in the case of a public health emergency.   . Courts in other states have decided vaccination cases differently. In 1979, for example, Mississippi’s Supreme Court upheld a vaccination requirement for school enrollment, holding that exemptions, including religious ones, put children at risk.  . Mississippi lawmakers have re-introduced legislation this year that would allow philosophical exemptions, but those efforts have been shot down several times in the past.    . Health officials and local representatives said they worry that allowing nonmedical exemptions means that some parents opt out simply because it’s easier.  . In Idaho, for example, many parents sign a personal belief waiver simply because the school has pointed out that a child is missing a required vaccine, said Tom Shanahan, public information officer for the Idaho Department of Health.  . Less than 1 percent of children in the state have received no vaccines at all, Shanahan said, but there is a 6.3 percent exemption rate across the state for one or more immunizations. Parents can use a waiver to exempt their child from some vaccinations or all of them. Idaho has not introduced legislation this year that would limit exemptions because “there’s a pretty strong culture of individual rights,” Shanahan said.   . And even if they are passed, stronger laws may not convince parents who oppose vaccines to immunize their children. One pediatric nurse practitioner, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution at work, said she has decided to home-school her four-year-old son after a Brooklyn school denied her repeated appeals to exempt him from his hepatitis B and flu shots. . “It’s completely unfair and it’s ridiculous and a violation of the Constitution,” the nurse practitioner said.  .

Lawrence Hurley|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court will weigh a second major case targeting President Barack Obama’s healthcare law on Wednesday when it considers a conservative challenge to tax subsidies critical to the measure’s implementation. . The case is set for a one-hour oral argument starting just after 10 a.m. (1500 GMT), with a ruling due by the end of June. . If a majority of the nine justices rules against the administration, up to 7.5 million people in at least 34 states would lose subsidies that help low- and moderate-income people afford private health insurance, unless Congress or the affected states act immediately.  . Such a ruling could also have a broader impact by deterring younger, healthier people from buying health insurance, which would lead to premiums rising for older, less healthy people who need healthcare most, said Rand Corporation economist Christine Eibner. . “It would cause major disruption to the individual insurance market,” Eibner added.  . The Democratic-backed law, narrowly passed by Congress over unified Republican opposition, aimed to help millions of Americans who lacked any health insurance afford coverage. . The case does not affect people who obtain health insurance through their employer.  . The legal question is whether only people who have bought insurance on state exchanges qualify for the tax-credit subsidies.  . Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have set up such exchanges, with another 34 run by the federal government and three operating as state-federal hybrids. . In a Reuters interview on Monday, Obama said there is “not a plausible legal basis” for the court to rule against the law, calling the matter a “pretty straightforward case of statutory interpretation.” . The first time the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, came before the justices three years ago, the court was split 5-4. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush, was the key swing vote, siding with the court’s four liberals to uphold the law on constitutional grounds. . Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy are the most likely swing votes in the new case. . The court will be focusing on whether a four-word phrase in the law has been correctly interpreted by the administration to allow subsidies to be available nationwide. . That provision says subsidies are available to those buying insurance on exchanges “established by the state.” The challengers, financed by a libertarian Washington group called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, say the government should lose based on the plain meaning of that phrase.  . The government, backed by the healthcare industry, says other provisions make clear Congress intended the subsidies to be available nationwide regardless of whether states set up their own exchanges or leave the task to the federal government. .

Emma Farge|DAKAR (Reuters) - Health officials botched more than 20 Ebola blood tests in January and February which led to the release of at least four positive patients, two of whom later died, Guinea’s anti-Ebola coordinator and other health officials told Reuters. . Five health officials and experts familiar with the incidents said the mistakes occurred at two different treatment centers and resulted in as many as 52 botched tests, exposing many others to the virus and revealing weaknesses in Guinea’s response to the crisis. . Dr. Sakoba Keita, Guinea’s anti-Ebola coordinator, confirmed the mistake had occurred but gave lower figures. He said in an emailed response to questions that 23 patients were affected, of whom four tested positive when they were retested and two died. . “This error was detected and the order was immediately given to withdraw the tubes and to find the sick in order to test them again,” Keita said. . Health officials, some of whom asked not to be named because they were worried about embarrassing the Guinean government, said the mistakes took place in Coyah, where Cuban medics are supporting a government-run center, and in Conakry, where medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres runs a center at the Donka hospital complex, when staff placed blood samples in the wrong test tubes, damaging specimens. . Patients were discharged from the centers in western Guinea, one of the biggest remaining Ebola hot spots in the region, after the test results came back negative from the laboratory at Donka, the health officials said. . At least six patients were later found to be Ebola-positive when further tests were carried out, and two of them died, the officials said.  . “There were deficiencies from the moment the samples were taken right through to the test results,” said one health official in Guinea, who requested anonymity. . The incident involved many actors in the Ebola response in Guinea, where the current outbreak was first confirmed a year ago and officials are scrambling to meet a regional deadline to reduce the number of cases to zero within six weeks. . The worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed nearly 10,000 people across West Africa. Guinea has recorded 2,091 deaths - fewer than in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the other worst-hit nations - and cases have fallen sharply in the past month. . Several officials said the blood test incident pointed to gaps in the country’s response. . “It’s not that their staff didn’t receive training. It’s just a question of being rigid and organized and that seems to be hard for Guinea,” said a Western health expert who spent months in the country.    . TEST TUBE MIX-UP . MSF said it discovered on Feb. 6 that blood samples from 43 patients taken from its Donka center had been placed in tubes containing the blood-thinning drug heparin. . Heparin typically takes the form of an invisible coating inside a tube whereas Ebola tubes are either empty or contain a blood preservative called EDTA. It should have been easy to identify the correct tubes since the set containing heparin have green lids and the ones used for Ebola are red or purple. . The World Health Organization (WHO) said staff taking samples had run out of the correct tubes and instead used the heparin tubes, without reporting it. . “MSF took the incident very seriously and immediately replaced the tubes and opened an investigation,” said Rosa Crestani, MSF’s emergency program coordinator. . Three of those tested were later discovered to be Ebola positive and recovered, she said. No one who came in contact with the trio contracted the disease. . At the Coyah center, Guinea’s busiest Ebola facility, which is also supported by staff from the African Union, the samples of nine people were accidentally placed in tubes also containing heparin, said another health official. . The official said that after initially being found to be negative, three of the nine later tested positive, of whom two died. No further cases among contacts of the Ebola patients released from Coyah have been identified, he said. . President Alpha Conde hopes to get to zero cases by mid-April as he seeks to lure back mining investment ahead of a presidential vote due later this year. . But Guinea is still battling often violent resistance to its Ebola health campaign. One of the sources said that a similar mix-up had occurred in late 2014. The government did not respond to a question about whether it had happened before. . Guinea has received less financial aid than other Ebola countries, with $266 million in commitments - about half that for Sierra Leone and a third of Liberia’s total, according to the U.N. financial tracking service. . France is providing technical support to its former colony, but it has not launched a military operation like Britain did for Sierra Leone and the United States did in Liberia. . The WHO said the mistake was not detected in the Donka laboratory, which tested both sets of samples, where technicians had received a “huge amount of samples”. . The laboratory is run by Guinea and supported by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar – a foundation created in 2009 by a statute signed between Senegal and France’s Institut Pasteur. . Dr. Andre Spiegel, director of the Institut Pasteur Dakar, declined to comment, saying the information was sensitive and confidential. . Guinea’s Keita said the WHO had sent a supervisor to assist the laboratory.  . Another Western official in Guinea said partners in a Guinea anti-Ebola drug test were now nervous about extending it to other centers in Guinea such as Coyah. . Dr. Dan Kelly, founder of the Wellbody Alliance providing healthcare in Sierra Leone, said it was not unusual for centers to run out of test tubes, but procedures existed.  . “Stock outs happen. What you are supposed to do is wait for the right colored tubes to arrive,” he said. |Tue Mar 03 15:01:41 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Guinea says Ebola patients sent home after botched blood tests |5.727738475246387e+17|http://reut.rs/1DEJHcv
Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - Many men are self-conscious about their penis size. Odds are they don’t need to be, but now there’s a chart of what’s “normal,” just in case. . This may be the most accurate estimate so far, according to Dr. Gordon Muir of King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London, coauthor of the new study. . Muir and his coauthors set out to create “nomograms” of flaccid and erect penis size measurements, excluding men with erectile dysfunction, past surgery or abnormalities.   . “The data comes from a very large number of men from the best existing studies,” Muir told Reuters Health by email. “We are particularly aware that many men with normal penis size can feel inadequate or ashamed, and this paper should allow specialists to reassure them.” . “We also hope that men may be spared unnecessary and harmful surgery, which some less reputable surgeons still promote,” he added. . Using more than 20,000 measurements of flaccid length, stretched length, erect length and flaccid and erect circumference, collected by health professionals for other studies, the researchers plotted the distribution of measurements to find the average. . The average flaccid penis was 3.58 inches long (about 9 cm) and 3.66 inches in girth, while the average erect penis was 5.16 inches long (about 13 cm) and 4.59 inches in circumference (about 11.7 cm), according to results online March 2 in BJU International. Stretched flaccid length was often very similar to erect length, the authors found, which may be good news for men and their doctors since clinical measurements of the erect penis may not be necessary. . Comparing these measures to other physical qualities, like age, body mass index or foot size, the authors found little or no association. Erect penis length and overall height did seem to be related at least somewhat, however – taller men had longer penises.  . “There is not a ‘right’ penis size for a man of any height, just a range of ‘normal,’” Muir said. “A bit like shoe size, really!” . As far as how one man compares to another, according to the distribution graphs the authors plotted, men in the 90th percentile for erect length were upwards of 5.9 inches long (about 15 cm), and some of the longest penises in the study were more than seven inches long erect (about 18 cm). . Technically, less than 1% of the male population has a “micropenis,” which in this group included men with flaccid length below 2.04 inches (about 5 cm). Other researchers have suggested that the smallest 2.2% of the population should be eligible for penile augmentation surgery, which would include those with flaccid length up to 2.36 inches (about 6 cm). . But defining “too big” or “too small” still hasn’t been firmly nailed down, Muir said. . “Many men with a 9 cm (3.54 inch) erection will have no problems having mutually satisfactory sexual relations, and few men with a longer than average penis seek medical help,” he said. “And research shows that women are rarely concerned about the penis size of their partner, rating it much less important than many other factors.” . Men may suffer psychological harm and relationship difficulties as a result of worrying about their size, and potential surgical “remedies” may be dangerous and are often unsatisfying, he said. . “We hope that these results will be of help to reputable clinicians who can use them to help reassure men with normal penis size they are indeed normal,” Muir said. “We also hope that no man will be subject to physical treatment without a clear understanding of where he sits in the normal range.” . There has been little to no similar research on discovering the “normal” for female genitalia, including vaginal capacity, he said. According to some studies, women who have reductive labiaplasty may generally be more satisfied than men who have penile enlargement surgery. . SOURCE: .   .

Gavin Jones|CROTONE, Italy (Reuters) - When an inter-city bus smashed into Giovannina Caprara’s car five years ago, she was fortunate to be admitted to coma rehabilitation clinic Istituto Sant’Anna, a rare world class medical institution in one of Europe’s poorest regions.  . In future, others may not be so lucky.  . Despite its excellence, Sant’Anna is struggling to maintain its services because of Italy’s decision to handle its public finance problems with indiscriminate, “linear” spending cuts that are being imposed across the board regardless of the quality of its medical care. . Giovannina, 49, is cared for at home by her daughter Maria Teresa and husband Domenico, while doctors supervise from Sant’Anna 40 miles away. The home-monitoring system has so far not been touched by the cuts. But clinic managers say there are fewer funds for the sort of research that bred the technology. . “We’ve been very lucky, the clinic has been wonderful,” Maria Teresa, 30, told Reuters during a recent visit. . Under pressure to curb the euro zone’s second-largest public debt, successive Italian governments have slashed funding for regions by 10 billion euros in the last five years. Regional authorities in turn have targeted the largest item on their own budget: health spending. . In Calabria, where Sant’Anna is located, the health service deficit has fallen to 40 million euros from 250 million euros since 2009. Because cuts are politically difficult, they have hit all of Calabria’s hospitals in the same way, regardless of medical or economic performance. . That means the Sant’Anna – whose success rate in reawakening people from comas is nearly 20 percent higher than the Italian average – faces similar cuts to those in any other hospital in the region. . The clinic has cut 20 percent of its staff, mainly reducing the number of nurses, says founder Giovanni Pugliese. “The government says we are an example for the country, but we are hit by incredible cuts,” he says.  . Italy’s approach reflects the political challenges that Rome, like other European capitals, face chipping away at the continent’s welfare state. . Europeans consider state-funded universal healthcare one of their most treasured rights. Yet countries have overspent, and many are now embarking on painful belt-tightening. . Italy’s previous government in 2013 recruited a top International Monetary Fund official to identify targeted cuts across Italy’s public administration to reward best practice. The effort stumbled and Carlo Cottarelli returned to the IMF. . “If everyone gets cut by 10 percent then everyone grumbles but you meet less resistance than if you say this precise department is badly run or superfluous and needs to close,” says Francesco Giavazzi, an economist who has also advised a former government on spending cuts. . The drive to cut costs on healthcare, where Italy spends more of its budget than on any other sector excluding pensions, began more than a decade ago. . Between 2000 and 2010, it cut the number of hospital beds per inhabitant more than any other country in the euro zone, except for Ireland, according to official European Union figures. Since 2010, the Italian government has also required people to pay a growing proportion of their medical services and medicines directly. . With less public investment, waiting lists for operations and other services have lengthened for those who can’t afford to go private. At San Camillo hospital in Rome, one of the capital’s largest, the lack of space is so acute that patients can remain for days on makeshift beds in the corridors. . Examples of what Italians call “malasanita” – or inefficiency, corruption or medical error – often hit the news. Last month the finance police in Reggio Calabria, not far from Sant’Anna, said they believed fraud was behind the case of a fully-equipped heart disease center completed in 2011 at a cost of 40 million euros which has never treated a patient because the Calabrian government can’t afford to hire any doctors. . When he founded Sant’Anna in 1996, Pugliese, 65, lured Giuliano Dolce, one of Italy’s foremost neurologists and an international expert on coma reawakenings, out of retirement. . It was a bold enterprise. Calabria’s quality of healthcare is among the worst in Italy; infant mortality is the highest of the country’s 20 regions. More patients leave Calabria than from any other region to seek treatment elsewhere, according to the health ministry. . The Sant’Anna steadily gained international recognition, however. In the past 18 years it has helped 1,200 people emerge from comas. . “People used to believe a coma patient was completely cut off from the world, but we realized it’s not like that,” says Dolce, who at 86 cuts a striking figure with his white hair and blue eyes. . Sant’Anna’s home-monitoring system uses technology and training of family members to give coma patients the same quality of care at home as they would receive in hospital. It costs the hospital less to oversee a patient remotely than to provide for his or her board at the clinic. . Giovannina Caprara, in a state that Dolce describes as “unresponsive wakeful system,” sits in a wheelchair in her cottage adorned with pictures of saints, and she sometimes seems to smile and laugh. . Maria Teresa says her mother makes small improvements. She has taken her to mass, into the countryside and to a wedding.  . “The doctors stop us building false hopes,” she said, adding: “I have always been happy with anything mum could give me.” |Tue Mar 03 13:26:53 +0000 2015||Indiscriminate cuts threaten Italy's healthcare successes |5.72749991581782e+17|http://reut.rs/1DE57Xj
|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will not scale down its multi-billion dollar food welfare program that promises ultra-cheap rice and wheat to most of its people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday. . A panel set up by Modi had urged the government in January to lower the number of beneficiaries to 40 percent from 67 percent under the program, which is estimated to cost the exchequer $20 billion in the fiscal year that begins in April. . “The government has not decided to reduce the coverage under food security from 67 percent,” Modi said. “There is no such plan either.” |Tue Mar 03 12:28:19 +0000 2015||India will not cut multi-billion dollar food handout program: PM |5.727352498027602e+17|http://reut.rs/1DDFPbZ
Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chris Barr had no problem getting his eight children exempted from vaccinations when they went to school. First in California, and later when the family moved to Arkansas, the natural healing practitioner simply signed a piece of paper stating that his personal beliefs didn’t allow the immunizations. . Such exclusions may not be so easy to obtain going forward. This year’s highly publicized measles outbreaks, which have infected more than 150 people in 17 states, are no longer front page news. But they could well have a lasting public health legacy. Already, lawmakers in at least 10 states are promoting legislation that would make exemptions far harder to obtain.  . The proposed laws have been introduced in statehouses by both Democrats and Republicans and include a range of approaches, from requiring schools to post immunization rates to entirely eliminating religious and philosophical exemptions. But they all respond to one undeniable fact: Most of the recent measles cases have been in people who were not vaccinated against the disease.  . Lawmakers say they are optimistic about the chances of the bills, though most of them aren’t far enough along in the pipeline to predict their fate. Many of the authors say the extensive coverage this year has helped their case.  . Legislators also say the laws they are proposing have received bipartisan support and that they are likely to survive consideration by legislative committees and be voted on in the coming weeks and months. In eight states, Democrats introduced the legislation, while in Texas and Vermont bills have been proposed by Republicans.     . “This is not the last outbreak we’re going to see,” said Washington Rep. June Robinson (D). “The issue will continue to be in the public conversation.”  . The year’s largest measles outbreak has been traced to Disneyland in Anaheim, California where visitors were exposed to the disease in mid-December. The vast majority of cases have been in that state, which allows both philosophical and religious exemptions.  . In all, 10 of the 17 states with reported measles cases have allowed parents to opt out of vaccines on philosophical grounds, creating a far easier way out of immunizations than states that only exempt families with extensively documented religious objections or health conditions that preclude vaccinations. Six of the 10 affected states with easy opt-out laws have proposed new legislation.    . Oregon and Washington have already held hearings on the proposed laws. But in most other states, bills have only recently been introduced or have yet to be scheduled for committee hearings.     . While nearly 80 percent of Americans believe all children should receive vaccinations, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, the proposed laws have mobilized a small but vocal community of anti-vaccine advocates who say parents should decide whether their children receive immunizations. Some of the so-called “anti-vaxers” fear vaccines may cause autism, a link scientists say has been thoroughly debunked. Others say they oppose government intrusion in parental decisions. . Several parents opposed to vaccinations testified at the Oregon and Washington hearings and larger numbers showed up last month at a Texas town hall where Rep. Jason Villalba (R) discussed a bill he introduced that would eliminate personal belief exemptions.   . In the past, local and national anti-vaccine organizations have successfully thwarted legal efforts to curb exemptions through grassroots efforts. Anti-vaxers quickly mobilized when Colorado, which permits personal and religious exemptions, introduced a measure last year that would require parents to complete an online module about immunizations or consult with a doctor before opting out. The bill passed the state’s House of Representatives but failed in the Senate after parents lobbied and testified in hearings.  . The National Vaccine Information Center, a non-profit with 37,000 subscribers to a portal that monitors all legislation concerning vaccines, has urged its members to raise their voices against this year’s crop of proposed laws, which they say could be a tougher fight because of the attention the measles outbreak has received.  . “It’s about respecting everybody’s lives,” said Barbara Lowe Fisher, the  group’s co-founder and president.  . In some states with easy exemption rules, decades-old court decisions will make changing the laws difficult, if not impossible.  . In Maryland, for example, the state’s Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that schools could not deny exemptions to parents with religious objections, saying that could lead to discrimination. The state does, however, have a law mandating vaccines in the case of a public health emergency.   . Courts in other states have decided vaccination cases differently. In 1979, for example, Mississippi’s Supreme Court upheld a vaccination requirement for school enrollment, holding that exemptions, including religious ones, put children at risk.  . Mississippi lawmakers have re-introduced legislation this year that would allow philosophical exemptions, but those efforts have been shot down several times in the past.    . Health officials and local representatives said they worry that allowing nonmedical exemptions means that some parents opt out simply because it’s easier.  . In Idaho, for example, many parents sign a personal belief waiver simply because the school has pointed out that a child is missing a required vaccine, said Tom Shanahan, public information officer for the Idaho Department of Health.  . Less than 1 percent of children in the state have received no vaccines at all, Shanahan said, but there is a 6.3 percent exemption rate across the state for one or more immunizations. Parents can use a waiver to exempt their child from some vaccinations or all of them. Idaho has not introduced legislation this year that would limit exemptions because “there’s a pretty strong culture of individual rights,” Shanahan said.   . And even if they are passed, stronger laws may not convince parents who oppose vaccines to immunize their children. One pediatric nurse practitioner, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution at work, said she has decided to home-school her four-year-old son after a Brooklyn school denied her repeated appeals to exempt him from his hepatitis B and flu shots. . “It’s completely unfair and it’s ridiculous and a violation of the Constitution,” the nurse practitioner said.  .

Jibran Ahmad|PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan authorities have arrested hundreds of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children against polio, officials said Tuesday, as community opposition and Taliban threats block efforts to eradicate the crippling disease in one of its last strongholds. . Frustrated officials turned to police to deal with parents influenced by some clerics who decry government vaccination campaigns as a tool to weaken Islam, according to Pervez Kamal, director of health for Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa region in the northwest. . “There was no other option. We have run so many awareness campaigns for the parents and general masses that there is no harm in the vaccine, but to no avail,” Kamal said. . Pakistan reported 306 polio cases last year, far and away the largest share of the 359 cases worldwide recorded by the Global Eradicate Polio Initiative. . Kamal said on Tuesday that a list of “chronic” refusal cases has been prepared and warrants issued for more than 1,000 parents. . “So far, we have arrested 471 parents and efforts are under way to capture others,” a police officer in Peshawar said. . Once a common childhood disease, polio - which can cause paralysis and mostly affects children under age five - has declined by 99 percent in the last 25 years with aggressive vaccination campaigns, according to the WHO. . Polio has made a comeback in Pakistan since the Taliban, seeking to topple the state and establish strict Islamic rule, began targeting government health workers conducting vaccine campaigns.  . Sixty-four people have been killed in attacks on polio teams and their security escorts since 2012, when the Taliban banned vaccinations in areas they controlled. . Some Pakistanis are also against vaccinations because they believe they are part of a Western plot to sterilize children. . The image of vaccinations suffered by association after a CIA-employed Pakistani doctor used the guise of a vaccination campaign to spy on Osama bin Laden in the months up to the U.S. raid that killed the al Qaeda chief in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. . The government conducts a national campaign against polio every month. Data from the first campaign of the year shows that nearly 60,000 children had been missed due to parental refusals. . A government official, Riaz Mehsud, said there had been more than 14,000 refusals alone in Peshawar. . “We have decided to take it a challenge and make sure that every child gets vaccinated,” Mehsud said. |Tue Mar 03 09:39:19 +0000 2015||Pakistan arrests parents for refusing children's polio vaccinations |5.7269272256332186e+17|http://reut.rs/1Co32n5
Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s main public health programs, aimed at millions of rural poor, have been in disarray for months because the government changed the way that over $1.3 billion in federal funds were distributed, according to data and letters seen by Reuters. . In a bid last year to give India’s states more power, the federal health ministry started sending funds for public health programs to state treasuries, instead of direct transfers to its regional arms.  . But poorly-run regional bureaucracies were unable to cope and both the flagship National Health Mission (NHM) and India’s AIDS prevention programs suffered - thousands of health workers were not paid for months and the construction of clinics in rural areas was delayed. . In some cases, state governments temporarily used the funds earmarked for health programs to meet needs of other sectors, health officials said. . The funds involved amounted to about one-third of the total federal spending on health, and led to further deterioration in India’s tattered public health system.  . Eleven letters obtained by a Reuters reporter under India’s Right to Information Act revealed the health ministry’s desperate, and failed, attempts to push states to release funds to NHM arms.  . “The progress in NHM works has slowed down considerably in most of the states,” federal Health Minister J.P. Nadda wrote in a letter to the finance minister in November. “I urge you to review the decision and allow the ministry to transfer funds directly to state health societies.”     . The decision last year to route many payments through states, launched by the previous Congress party-led government, affected other sectors as well, but the impact on health programs has been glaring.  . India spends just 1 percent of its GDP on public health, less than Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. On Saturday, the  federal government increased the annual budget for its main health department by just 2 percent to $4.8 billion. . Still, India struggles to spend all of its allocated health funds because of an inadequate number of doctors and hospitals, and bureaucratic bungling. Data shows the government has only once spent all of its health budget since 2005. . Since April, the federal government has sent more than $1.3 billion to the states for the NHM, which undertakes treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, construction of rural health centers and immunization drives. . No state treasury released the funds to the designated health societies within a stipulated 15-day period, with delays running into months in some cases, according to government data seen by Reuters. More than $180 million is still to be released. . “BUREAU-CRAZY” . Manoj Jhalani, joint secretary at India’s health ministry, told Reuters that several states have voiced concern about the delays and discussions are ongoing to resolve the situation.  . “If resources are not provided in time, implementation of the program does get affected. There has been some impact on the smooth operation of NHM,” Jhalani said. . Several NHM officials interviewed by Reuters said the state health units were deprived of funds for months. Salaries, training and building new clinics were hit. . In the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, 9,000 health workers have not received salaries for three months and cash incentives for women who give birth in a government hospital have been withheld, said Yash Pal Sharma, the state’s director for the NHM. . Treasuries in the north-eastern states of Meghalaya and Mizoram held NHM funds for 151 days and 79 days, respectively, data as of Feb. 22 showed. In India’s third-largest state Maharashtra, funds sent in June reached the health society in December. . “Outreach programs have been severely impacted,” said a health ministry official in New Delhi. “The entire system has been paralyzed, bureaucracy has become bureau-crazy.” . India’s AIDS prevention drive, a program separate from the NHM, was also affected by the new payments system. Workers from high-risk groups, such as sex workers and injectable drug users, who are employed to run programs within their communities are quitting because of irregular pay. . Rama, a project manager in one such community-based program for sex workers in Mumbai, said 17 of her 23 team members have quit because of delayed salaries. New people hired will take months before they can efficiently run the program. . “It takes a lot of time to build trust within our communities. Our HIV testing numbers have fallen by half because sex workers don’t trust new people,” said the 26-year-old, who says she moonlights as a sex worker herself to survive. . India runs more than 1,800 community-based programs for AIDS prevention. The World Bank has estimated India’s policy of targeting sex workers to control AIDS would avert three million infections during 1995-2015. . Government data showed that India’s National AIDS Control Organisation released $67 million to state governments in recent months as a second installment for the overall program, but only $39 million reached its state-level health societies. The first installment of $78 million was released by state treasuries after months of delays. . “What can we do if states are not caring about its people?” said a government official in the federal capital, New Delhi. “Now we are at risk of the numbers (of AIDS patients) increasing again.” |Tue Mar 03 07:01:47 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Payment delays dent India's flagship health, AIDS programs |5.7265307630741914e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cnt5ed
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Alzheimer’s researchers at Harvard for the first time are scanning the brains of healthy patients for the presence of a hallmark protein called tau, which forms toxic tangles of nerve fibers associated with the fatal disease. . The new scans are part of a large clinical trial called Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s or A4, the first designed to identify and treat patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, before memory loss begins.  . Patients accepted into the A4 trial already have deposits of beta amyloid, the other protein associated with Alzheimer’s. The addition of the tau scan will allow scientists to get a much clearer picture of the events that lead to Alzheimer’s. The disease affects 5 million Americans, and 16 million are projected to be afflicted by 2050. . Dr. Reisa Sperling of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who is leading the 1,000-patient trial, said tau is commonly found in small amounts in healthy people over age 70, but it is generally confined to an area of the brain called the medial temporal lobe.  . When amyloid is present, it somehow opens the door for tau to spread to other parts of the brain, causing widespread cell death and cognitive decline. . “Tau is the actual bad actor on the front line that tears up the brain. Being able to see it in living humans is a breakthrough,” said Dr. Keith Johnson, director of molecular neuroimaging at Massachusetts General, who is leading the imaging portion of the A4 trial.  . In the study, patients will be offered treatments to remove amyloid from the brain in the hopes of keeping tau in check. . Several companies have developed drugs aiming to remove amyloid and alter the course of Alzheimer’s, but all failed to show a significant benefit. Sperling and other researchers believe that’s because the drugs were introduced too late after the onset of disease. . In 2012, Eli Lilly’s solanezumab failed to slow the disease in patients with two trials of patients with mild to moderate symptoms. But combined results showed the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline by 34 percent among patients who started with only mild symptoms.  . Patients in the A4 trial will be randomized to receive Lilly’s anti-amyloid drug or a placebo for about three years. Lilly is funding the trial, along with the National Institutes of Health and several philanthropic organizations. . Researchers plan to do tau imaging on up to 500 patients in the A4 trial. The tau imaging will be paid for by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, which is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Alzheimer’s Association. . Arthur Canter, 67, a retired executive from Boston, will be the first A4 patient to be scanned for tau. Canter, who has a sharp memory and quick wit, already has amyloid building up in his brain. . Canter gets his scan on Tuesday and fully expects it will show deposits of tau forming as well. His mother, 91, has Alzheimer’s, and his father showed signs of dementia when he died in his 70s from an unrelated condition.  . “My assumption, predicated on my own genetics, is that I am likely to be get Alzheimer’s. In this regard, I’d rather hit it head on,” he said. |Tue Mar 03 06:19:05 +0000 2015||Harvard prevention trial studies tau, Alzheimer's other protein |5.726423297581957e+17|http://reut.rs/1DBnzzJ
James Pearson|SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea officially reopened its borders on Tuesday to foreign tourists and businessmen nearly five months after shutting them over fear of the deadly Ebola virus, tour agencies and a diplomatic source told Reuters. . “We’ve had it confirmed officially that the border is now open,” said Troy Collings, manager of the China-based Young Pioneer Tours, which takes Western tourists into North Korea. . North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated countries and is thousands of miles from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It has reported no cases of the virus, which has killed more than 9,000 people. . However, its borders have been closed to foreign tourists since last October for fear the virus might spread and it imposes a strict 21-day quarantine for foreign aid workers and diplomats, who have been told to stay in embassy compounds. . A diplomatic source in Pyongyang confirmed the border had been reopened but said it was unclear if the measures had been completely revoked because quarantine would remain in place for several African countries. . Collings said his company had been told trade would resume under normal conditions from Tuesday. . “Quarantines will be lifted for most NGO workers and diplomats resident in the country and tours will be allowed to resume in the next couple of days,” said Collings. . Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it had been asked by its North Korean partners to apply for tours and was expecting to take its first group of the year on March 14. |Tue Mar 03 03:48:13 +0000 2015||North Korea reopens borders after months-long Ebola shutdown |5.726043620627374e+17|http://reut.rs/1DAr5KO
|LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences’ expensive two-in-one hepatitis C pill Harvoni has been endorsed for use on the state health service in Britain, where it costs significantly less than in the United States.  . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Tuesday it had issued draft guidance recommending the medicine as a treatment option for some adults with certain strains of chronic hepatitis C, known as genotype 1 or 4. . Gilead’s new hepatitis drugs are revolutionizing the treatment of the liver-destroying disease by offering an effective cure, but their high price has sparked controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. . In Britain, where NICE’s control over which drugs are used on the National Health Service exerts downward pressure on prices, Harvoni is priced at 38,979.99 pounds ($58,400) for a 12-week treatment course - a third less than in the United States. . Harvoni combines Gilead’s drug Sovaldi, which was approved by NICE last year, with another of its anti-viral medicines into a daily pill. . Gilead argues that high prices are justified by the near guarantee of a cure and the ability to help patients avoid far more expensive hospital treatment, including potential liver transplants. |Tue Mar 03 00:28:12 +0000 2015||UK cost body backs Gilead's pricey combination hepatitis pill |5.725540275919626e+17|http://reut.rs/1DzeGGW
Joseph D'Urso|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost 30 countries around the world are “highly vulnerable” to an Ebola-style epidemic, with Somalia, Chad, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Haiti most at risk, a major charity said on Tuesday. . An increasingly mobile global population makes deadly outbreaks more likely, with the emergence of two new diseases a year that can be spread between animals and humans making stronger health systems crucial, Save the Children said. . The charity’s report comes as political and development agency leaders gather in Brussels to discuss the Ebola crisis that has killed nearly 10,000 people and infected almost 24,000 others, according to latest World Health Organisation (WHO) data. . Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said a robust health system could have halted the rapid spread of Ebola through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia over the past year and   saved thousands of children’s lives. . He said it was now critical to bolster the health systems of other poor countries so they can deal with any Ebola-style outbreak, control new diseases and save the lives of up to 17,000 children a day who die of preventable conditions such as pneumonia and malaria. . “The world woke up to Ebola but now people need to wake up to the scandal of weak health systems,” Forsyth said in a statement. . To find countries most at risk of an Ebola-style outbreak, the charity compiled an index of the public health systems of the world’s poorest countries based on the number of health workers, government spending on health and mortality rates. . Somalia ranked lowest with the index finding there is one health worker for every 6,711 people compared to one health worker for every 88 people in Britain. . In Afghanistan, which was fourth lowest, public spending on health is $10.71 per person a year compared to more than $3,000 in Britain. . The WHO says governments should spend a minimum of $86 per capita on health, but Liberia spends $19.5, Sierra Leone spends $15.9 and Guinean spends $9 per capita, according to the Save the Children report. . The report said it would cost $1.58 billion to strengthen the health systems of three worst affected West African nations to be able to offer a “minimum package” of essential health services recommended by the WHO. The international Ebola relief effort has cost almost three times as much. . “In the past, there has been a desire to deal with urgent problems, but not address the chronic health care issues that underlay why these outbreaks occur,” Brendan Cox, director of policy and advocacy for Save the Children, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . “After Ebola, that has got to change.”  |Tue Mar 03 00:28:11 +0000 2015||Nearly 30 countries 'highly vulnerable' to Ebola-style epidemic: charity |5.72554025591296e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cm2NsA
Emma Farge|DAKAR (Reuters) - Health officials botched more than 20 Ebola blood tests in January and February which led to the release of at least four positive patients, two of whom later died, Guinea’s anti-Ebola coordinator and other health officials told Reuters. . Five health officials and experts familiar with the incidents said the mistakes occurred at two different treatment centers and resulted in as many as 52 botched tests, exposing many others to the virus and revealing weaknesses in Guinea’s response to the crisis. . Dr. Sakoba Keita, Guinea’s anti-Ebola coordinator, confirmed the mistake had occurred but gave lower figures. He said in an emailed response to questions that 23 patients were affected, of whom four tested positive when they were retested and two died. . “This error was detected and the order was immediately given to withdraw the tubes and to find the sick in order to test them again,” Keita said. . Health officials, some of whom asked not to be named because they were worried about embarrassing the Guinean government, said the mistakes took place in Coyah, where Cuban medics are supporting a government-run center, and in Conakry, where medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres runs a center at the Donka hospital complex, when staff placed blood samples in the wrong test tubes, damaging specimens. . Patients were discharged from the centers in western Guinea, one of the biggest remaining Ebola hot spots in the region, after the test results came back negative from the laboratory at Donka, the health officials said. . At least six patients were later found to be Ebola-positive when further tests were carried out, and two of them died, the officials said.  . “There were deficiencies from the moment the samples were taken right through to the test results,” said one health official in Guinea, who requested anonymity. . The incident involved many actors in the Ebola response in Guinea, where the current outbreak was first confirmed a year ago and officials are scrambling to meet a regional deadline to reduce the number of cases to zero within six weeks. . The worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed nearly 10,000 people across West Africa. Guinea has recorded 2,091 deaths - fewer than in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the other worst-hit nations - and cases have fallen sharply in the past month. . Several officials said the blood test incident pointed to gaps in the country’s response. . “It’s not that their staff didn’t receive training. It’s just a question of being rigid and organized and that seems to be hard for Guinea,” said a Western health expert who spent months in the country.    . TEST TUBE MIX-UP . MSF said it discovered on Feb. 6 that blood samples from 43 patients taken from its Donka center had been placed in tubes containing the blood-thinning drug heparin. . Heparin typically takes the form of an invisible coating inside a tube whereas Ebola tubes are either empty or contain a blood preservative called EDTA. It should have been easy to identify the correct tubes since the set containing heparin have green lids and the ones used for Ebola are red or purple. . The World Health Organization (WHO) said staff taking samples had run out of the correct tubes and instead used the heparin tubes, without reporting it. . “MSF took the incident very seriously and immediately replaced the tubes and opened an investigation,” said Rosa Crestani, MSF’s emergency program coordinator. . Three of those tested were later discovered to be Ebola positive and recovered, she said. No one who came in contact with the trio contracted the disease. . At the Coyah center, Guinea’s busiest Ebola facility, which is also supported by staff from the African Union, the samples of nine people were accidentally placed in tubes also containing heparin, said another health official. . The official said that after initially being found to be negative, three of the nine later tested positive, of whom two died. No further cases among contacts of the Ebola patients released from Coyah have been identified, he said. . President Alpha Conde hopes to get to zero cases by mid-April as he seeks to lure back mining investment ahead of a presidential vote due later this year. . But Guinea is still battling often violent resistance to its Ebola health campaign. One of the sources said that a similar mix-up had occurred in late 2014. The government did not respond to a question about whether it had happened before. . Guinea has received less financial aid than other Ebola countries, with $266 million in commitments - about half that for Sierra Leone and a third of Liberia’s total, according to the U.N. financial tracking service. . France is providing technical support to its former colony, but it has not launched a military operation like Britain did for Sierra Leone and the United States did in Liberia. . The WHO said the mistake was not detected in the Donka laboratory, which tested both sets of samples, where technicians had received a “huge amount of samples”. . The laboratory is run by Guinea and supported by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar – a foundation created in 2009 by a statute signed between Senegal and France’s Institut Pasteur. . Dr. Andre Spiegel, director of the Institut Pasteur Dakar, declined to comment, saying the information was sensitive and confidential. . Guinea’s Keita said the WHO had sent a supervisor to assist the laboratory.  . Another Western official in Guinea said partners in a Guinea anti-Ebola drug test were now nervous about extending it to other centers in Guinea such as Coyah. . Dr. Dan Kelly, founder of the Wellbody Alliance providing healthcare in Sierra Leone, said it was not unusual for centers to run out of test tubes, but procedures existed.  . “Stock outs happen. What you are supposed to do is wait for the right colored tubes to arrive,” he said. |Tue Mar 03 00:01:11 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Guinea says Ebola patients sent home after botched blood tests |5.72547230160298e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dz4PRm
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization in Europe called on Wednesday for measles vaccination campaigns to be stepped up across the region after recording 22,000 cases of the highly infectious disease since the start of 2014. . Saying she was “taken aback” by high case numbers, Zsuzsanna Jakab, the U.N. health agency’s European director, said the 22,149 reported cases from seven countries threatened the region’s goal of eliminating measles by the end of 2015. . Even though measles cases fell by 50 percent from 2013 to 2014, large outbreaks continue in both eastern and western Europe, the WHO said.  . Italy has seen 1,674 measles cases since the beginning of last year, while Germany has had 583, Kyrgyzstan 7,477 and Russia more than 3,240. . “We must collectively respond, without further delay, to close immunization gaps,” Jakab said in a statement. “It is unacceptable that, after the last 50 years’ efforts to make safe and effective vaccines available, measles continues to cost lives, money and time.” . Measles is a contagious and sometimes deadly viral disease which can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment and most people recover within a few weeks, but, particularly in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. . A measles outbreak in the United States has seen more than 150 people infected, many of them linked to the wave of illness that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December 2014. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But that status was lost after immunization rates were damaged by an anti-vaccination movement driven in the past decade by now de-bunked studies suggesting links between vaccines and autism. . In 2014, the United States had its highest number of cases in two decades. . Nedret Emiroglu, a WHO Europe’s infectious diseases expert, said beating the disease meant controlling any epidemics as quickly as possible and pushing vaccination rates to the highest possible levels in every country. . “All countries, with no exception, need to keep a very high coverage of regular measles vaccination so that similar outbreaks won’t happen again... and measles can be eliminated once and for all,” she said. |Mon Mar 02 23:29:33 +0000 2015||WHO calls for more measles vaccination in Europe as large outbreaks persist |5.725392680207688e+17|http://reut.rs/1ClJcZJ
Roberta Rampton|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday said he thinks there is no “plausible legal basis” for the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a key plank of Obamacare, defending his administration’s lack of a contingency plan. . And he promised to rule on the Keystone XL pipeline before he leaves office, although he would not say whether it will take him “weeks or months” to determine whether the project is in the national interest. . Obama touched on two main domestic policy issues during an interview with Reuters. . On the Affordable Care Act, his signature policy achievement commonly referred to as Obamacare, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Wednesday in the case known as King v. Burwell. . The case challenges wording in the 2010 law that could affect whether residents in at least 34 U.S. states are eligible for federal tax subsidies to help them buy insurance. . “Look, this should be a pretty straightforward case of statutory interpretation,” Obama said. . “If you look at the law, if you look at the testimony of those who are involved in the law, including some of the opponents of the law, the understanding was that people who joined a federal exchange were going to be able to access tax credits just like if they went through a state exchange,” he said. . “There is, in our view, not a plausible legal basis for striking it down,” he said. . If the Supreme Court disagrees, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has told lawmakers that there are no contingency plans to deal with the loss of subsidies. . “If they rule against us, we’ll have to take a look at what our options are. But I’m not going to anticipate that. I’m not going to anticipate bad law,” Obama told Reuters. . On the Canada-to-Texas Keystone crude oil pipeline, which has been in limbo for more than six years, Obama said a decision “will happen before the end of my administration, definitely.” . Asked whether it would take weeks or months, he answered with a smile: “Weeks or months.” . The TransCanada Corp pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels a day of mostly Canadian oil sands crude. . Environmentalists have fought the pipeline because they argue it will spur development of a fuel they say is more polluting than other types of crude oil. . Energy industry officials argue that oil sands development is destined to expand and blocking Keystone would do nothing to discourage development. |Mon Mar 02 22:42:24 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Obama defends lack of 'Plan B' for Obamacare court case |5.725274041550561e+17|http://reut.rs/1DyDheU
Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s main public health programs, aimed at millions of rural poor, have been in disarray for months because the government changed the way that over $1.3 billion in federal funds were distributed, according to data and letters seen by Reuters. . In a bid last year to give India’s states more power, the federal health ministry started sending funds for public health programs to state treasuries, instead of direct transfers to its regional arms.  . But poorly-run regional bureaucracies were unable to cope and both the flagship National Health Mission (NHM) and India’s AIDS prevention programs suffered - thousands of health workers were not paid for months and the construction of clinics in rural areas was delayed. . In some cases, state governments temporarily used the funds earmarked for health programs to meet needs of other sectors, health officials said. . The funds involved amounted to about one-third of the total federal spending on health, and led to further deterioration in India’s tattered public health system.  . Eleven letters obtained by a Reuters reporter under India’s Right to Information Act revealed the health ministry’s desperate, and failed, attempts to push states to release funds to NHM arms.  . “The progress in NHM works has slowed down considerably in most of the states,” federal Health Minister J.P. Nadda wrote in a letter to the finance minister in November. “I urge you to review the decision and allow the ministry to transfer funds directly to state health societies.”     . The decision last year to route many payments through states, launched by the previous Congress party-led government, affected other sectors as well, but the impact on health programs has been glaring.  . India spends just 1 percent of its GDP on public health, less than Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. On Saturday, the  federal government increased the annual budget for its main health department by just 2 percent to $4.8 billion. . Still, India struggles to spend all of its allocated health funds because of an inadequate number of doctors and hospitals, and bureaucratic bungling. Data shows the government has only once spent all of its health budget since 2005. . Since April, the federal government has sent more than $1.3 billion to the states for the NHM, which undertakes treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, construction of rural health centers and immunization drives. . No state treasury released the funds to the designated health societies within a stipulated 15-day period, with delays running into months in some cases, according to government data seen by Reuters. More than $180 million is still to be released. . “BUREAU-CRAZY” . Manoj Jhalani, joint secretary at India’s health ministry, told Reuters that several states have voiced concern about the delays and discussions are ongoing to resolve the situation.  . “If resources are not provided in time, implementation of the program does get affected. There has been some impact on the smooth operation of NHM,” Jhalani said. . Several NHM officials interviewed by Reuters said the state health units were deprived of funds for months. Salaries, training and building new clinics were hit. . In the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, 9,000 health workers have not received salaries for three months and cash incentives for women who give birth in a government hospital have been withheld, said Yash Pal Sharma, the state’s director for the NHM. . Treasuries in the north-eastern states of Meghalaya and Mizoram held NHM funds for 151 days and 79 days, respectively, data as of Feb. 22 showed. In India’s third-largest state Maharashtra, funds sent in June reached the health society in December. . “Outreach programs have been severely impacted,” said a health ministry official in New Delhi. “The entire system has been paralyzed, bureaucracy has become bureau-crazy.” . India’s AIDS prevention drive, a program separate from the NHM, was also affected by the new payments system. Workers from high-risk groups, such as sex workers and injectable drug users, who are employed to run programs within their communities are quitting because of irregular pay. . Rama, a project manager in one such community-based program for sex workers in Mumbai, said 17 of her 23 team members have quit because of delayed salaries. New people hired will take months before they can efficiently run the program. . “It takes a lot of time to build trust within our communities. Our HIV testing numbers have fallen by half because sex workers don’t trust new people,” said the 26-year-old, who says she moonlights as a sex worker herself to survive. . India runs more than 1,800 community-based programs for AIDS prevention. The World Bank has estimated India’s policy of targeting sex workers to control AIDS would avert three million infections during 1995-2015. . Government data showed that India’s National AIDS Control Organisation released $67 million to state governments in recent months as a second installment for the overall program, but only $39 million reached its state-level health societies. The first installment of $78 million was released by state treasuries after months of delays. . “What can we do if states are not caring about its people?” said a government official in the federal capital, New Delhi. “Now we are at risk of the numbers (of AIDS patients) increasing again.” |Mon Mar 02 21:39:31 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Payment delays dent India's flagship health, AIDS programs |5.7251157616039526e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cl6Rt9
Will Dunham|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Revealing new details about the origins of AIDS, scientists said on Monday half the lineages of the main type of human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1, originated in gorillas in Cameroon before infecting people, probably via bushmeat hunting. . HIV-1, which causes AIDS, is composed of four groups, each coming from a separate cross-species transmission of a simian version of the virus from apes to humans. . Previous research identified chimpanzees in southern Cameroon as the source of HIV-1 group M, which has infected more than 40 million people worldwide and triggered the AIDS pandemic, as well as the geographically limited group N, identified in only about 20 people. . Until now, the source of the two other groups, known as O and P, had not been confirmed. The new research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed those groups originated in western lowland gorillas in southern Cameroon. . “Thus, both chimpanzees and gorillas harbor viruses that are capable of crossing the species barrier to humans and causing major disease outbreaks,” said virologist Martine Peeters of the Institute for Research and Development and University of Montpellier in France. . The researchers examined fecal samples from different gorillas across central Africa, including western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas in Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, for evidence of the gorilla version of HIV. . Genetic analyses implicated the western lowland gorillas as the source of HIV-1 groups O and P. . “The mode of transmission is most likely exposure to infected blood and/or tissues during hunting and butchering for bushmeat,” Peeters said. . Group O viruses, the second most common HIV-1 lineage, have spread across Cameroon, Gabon, Nigeria and neighboring countries and have infected about 100,000 people. Group P viruses have been documented in just two Cameroonian patients. . The researchers said group O emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. Group P arose sometime later that century. . University of Pennsylvania microbiologist Beatrice Hahn, the study’s other co-leader, said there does not appear to be any inherent viral property that prevented the group O lineage from becoming a pandemic-causing pathogen like group M. “Hence, on this occasion, humans got lucky,” Hahn said. . Another virus type, called HIV-2, is mainly restricted to West Africa, less easily transmitted than HIV-1 and has a slower progression to AIDS. It was transmitted from monkeys called sooty mangabeys to humans in West Africa. |Mon Mar 02 20:18:25 +0000 2015||Study finds gorilla origins in half of human AIDS virus lineages |5.724911663625544e+17|http://reut.rs/1CkCB1r
Andrew Chung|(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday ruled that a federal jury had erred in 2011 when it awarded medical technology company Medtronic Plc $101.2 million in a patent infringement case, and ordered a new trial to determine damages.   . But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the top U.S. patent appeals court, upheld the jury’s finding that NuVasive Inc’s spinal surgery devices had infringed Medtronic’s spinal implant and surgical method patents. . The three-judge appeals court said Medtronic unit Warsaw Orthopedic Inc was not entitled to recover damages in the form of lost profits and ongoing royalties, even if the jury in the federal trial in San Diego appeared to say it was.   . “Our rejection of Warsaw’s claims for lost profits does not mean that Warsaw is precluded from any recovery. Warsaw is entitled to a reasonable royalty sufficient to compensate it for the value of what was taken from it - the value of the patented technology,” the appeals panel said. . The jury in 2011 found that San Diego-based NuVasive had infringed three patents, but the appeal involved only two of them. . The appeals court sent the case back to the San Diego court for a new trial on the damages figure. . Representatives of Minneapolis-based Medtronic and NuVasive could not immediately be reached for comment.  . In January, Medtronic completed its acquisition of Covidien Plc. Its executive offices are now based in Dublin, Ireland.  . The case is Warsaw Orthopedic, Inc et al v. NuVasive, Inc, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 13-1576.  |Mon Mar 02 20:02:43 +0000 2015||U.S. court orders new trial for damages in Medtronic patent case |5.724872167542702e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ckxm1Q
Marice Richter|DALLAS (Reuters) - The first person infected with Ebola in the United States, nurse Nina Pham, sued a Texas hospital on Monday, saying it did not do enough to prevent her from contracting the deadly virus and invaded her privacy after she was diagnosed with it. . In the suit against Texas Health Resources (THR) in Dallas County Court, Pham claims the hospital did not initially provide nurses with proper protective equipment or properly train staff on how to treat the disease. . The suit accuses the hospital of negligence and deception. It does not specify an amount in damages.  . Pham, 26, was one of two nurses at the Dallas hospital who contracted the disease when treating Thomas Duncan, who was admitted in late September and died less than two weeks later. Both nurses recovered. Duncan contracted the disease in Liberia. . Pham became a national symbol of hope in fighting Ebola after she made a recovery and was greeted in the Oval Office by President Barack Obama. . The suit claims that the THR’s Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital did not initially provide adequate protective gear for medical staff or instructions on how to treat someone with Ebola. It also describes a hospital in chaos, where medical waste that could have carried the virus was left to pile up. . “The nurses were just using their best guesses and their instincts to protect themselves,” the suit said. . The hospital did not address the details of Pham’s accusations and said in a statement: “As distressing as the lawsuit is to us, we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with Nina.” . Pham claims the hospital used her as a “public relations pawn” to improve its plummeting image. While it issued news releases saying her condition had improved to “good,” it was having end of life conversations with her, Pham alleges. . Pham said the hospital did not respect her right to privacy. In one instance, she was videotaped speaking to a doctor and the video was released to the media. Pham said both the taping and release happened without her permission.  . “I was hoping that THR would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital, and the things they didn’t do that led to me getting infected with Ebola. But that didn’t happen and I felt I was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help,” Pham said in a statement. |Mon Mar 02 19:19:34 +0000 2015||Texas nurse sues Dallas hospital over Ebola infection |5.7247635718947226e+17|http://reut.rs/1CkkRTW
Lisa Rapaport|While concussions and physical injuries in high school sports are commanding more attention, young athletes still aren’t getting enough help with mental health issues such as depression, bullying, substance abuse, and eating disorders, experts say. . New guidelines released this morning at the sixth Youth Sports Safety Summit in Dallas, hosted by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association and the Youth Sports Safety Alliance, urge coaches and parents to be more vigilant in watching for signs of mental distress. . “Concussions are a big issue and deserve to be taken seriously, but in my 35 years practicing as an athletic trainer you had four to five times more athletes requiring mental health care than trying to recover from concussions,” said Timothy Neal, chair of the task force that wrote the recommendations for handling psychological problems among high school athletes.  . A challenge with detecting and treating mental health issues in high school athletes is broaching concerns without making young people feel stigmatized, said Neal, former head athletic trainer at Syracuse University. . “There is no substitute for just getting to know the players, and paying attention when you see their behavior change so that you can just casually ask them how things are going and keep a dialogue going that makes them feel safe talking about whatever might be going on,” Neal told Reuters Health in a phone interview. . The recommendations are intended to make sure coaches, teachers, athletic trainers, school nurses, and parents all know the warning signs for psychological problems and have plans in place for referring students to mental health professionals when necessary. . Along with ordinary pressures of high school, athletes face many situations that can contribute to mental health problems, such as being cut from a team, getting injured, making mistakes on the field, receiving media attention, and competing for athletic scholarships. . Often, physical injuries spur psychological ones, said Dr. Margot Putukian, a co-author of the recommendations and director of athletic medicine at Princeton University.  . Especially if the injury requires surgery and weeks or months on the sidelines, “the injury itself can be a trigger that unmasks underlying psychological issues,” Putukian said in a phone interview.   . For teens who may be prone to periods of moodiness, parents and coaches should intervene if the behavior changes continue over time, she said.  . “If someone is withdrawn or isolating or not spending time with their friends and having difficulty sleeping and it persists, then you have to be concerned,” Putukian said. . The recommendations, published in the Journal of Athletic Training, detail common symptoms of mental health problems in athletes. . For example, athletes with eating disorders might exercise compulsively, suffer from extreme dehydration, or have gastrointestinal problems.  . Athletes being bullied might have unexplained injuries, lost personal items, or complain of frequent headaches or stomach pain. Those doing the bullying might become increasingly aggressive, have unexplained money or belongings, or get in frequent verbal or physical fights.  . Students who are depressed might lack energy or lose interest in sports, or have a change in appetite that leads them to gain or lose a visible amount of weight. Often, students who abuse drugs and alcohol also have an underlying mental health issue such as depression.  . Parents and coaches must collaborate on mental health issues as they would for physical injuries, said Dr. Victor Schwartz, medical director of the Jed Foundation, which focuses on athletes and mental health, and clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center. . “Parents and coaches and every other adult in the school athletic community needs to take on responsibility not just to make sure that kids’ knees are healthy but also that their minds are healthy too,” Schwartz, who wasn’t involved in the guidelines, said in a phone interview. “The guidelines are putting mental health front and center and providing some tools for recognizing issues and getting kids help.” .

Emma Farge|DAKAR (Reuters) - Health officials botched more than 20 Ebola blood tests in January and February which led to the release of at least four positive patients, two of whom later died, Guinea’s anti-Ebola coordinator and other health officials told Reuters. . Five health officials and experts familiar with the incidents said the mistakes occurred at two different treatment centers and resulted in as many as 52 botched tests, exposing many others to the virus and revealing weaknesses in Guinea’s response to the crisis. . Dr. Sakoba Keita, Guinea’s anti-Ebola coordinator, confirmed the mistake had occurred but gave lower figures. He said in an emailed response to questions that 23 patients were affected, of whom four tested positive when they were retested and two died. . “This error was detected and the order was immediately given to withdraw the tubes and to find the sick in order to test them again,” Keita said. . Health officials, some of whom asked not to be named because they were worried about embarrassing the Guinean government, said the mistakes took place in Coyah, where Cuban medics are supporting a government-run center, and in Conakry, where medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres runs a center at the Donka hospital complex, when staff placed blood samples in the wrong test tubes, damaging specimens. . Patients were discharged from the centers in western Guinea, one of the biggest remaining Ebola hot spots in the region, after the test results came back negative from the laboratory at Donka, the health officials said. . At least six patients were later found to be Ebola-positive when further tests were carried out, and two of them died, the officials said.  . “There were deficiencies from the moment the samples were taken right through to the test results,” said one health official in Guinea, who requested anonymity. . The incident involved many actors in the Ebola response in Guinea, where the current outbreak was first confirmed a year ago and officials are scrambling to meet a regional deadline to reduce the number of cases to zero within six weeks. . The worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed nearly 10,000 people across West Africa. Guinea has recorded 2,091 deaths - fewer than in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the other worst-hit nations - and cases have fallen sharply in the past month. . Several officials said the blood test incident pointed to gaps in the country’s response. . “It’s not that their staff didn’t receive training. It’s just a question of being rigid and organized and that seems to be hard for Guinea,” said a Western health expert who spent months in the country.    . TEST TUBE MIX-UP . MSF said it discovered on Feb. 6 that blood samples from 43 patients taken from its Donka center had been placed in tubes containing the blood-thinning drug heparin. . Heparin typically takes the form of an invisible coating inside a tube whereas Ebola tubes are either empty or contain a blood preservative called EDTA. It should have been easy to identify the correct tubes since the set containing heparin have green lids and the ones used for Ebola are red or purple. . The World Health Organization (WHO) said staff taking samples had run out of the correct tubes and instead used the heparin tubes, without reporting it. . “MSF took the incident very seriously and immediately replaced the tubes and opened an investigation,” said Rosa Crestani, MSF’s emergency program coordinator. . Three of those tested were later discovered to be Ebola positive and recovered, she said. No one who came in contact with the trio contracted the disease. . At the Coyah center, Guinea’s busiest Ebola facility, which is also supported by staff from the African Union, the samples of nine people were accidentally placed in tubes also containing heparin, said another health official. . The official said that after initially being found to be negative, three of the nine later tested positive, of whom two died. No further cases among contacts of the Ebola patients released from Coyah have been identified, he said. . President Alpha Conde hopes to get to zero cases by mid-April as he seeks to lure back mining investment ahead of a presidential vote due later this year. . But Guinea is still battling often violent resistance to its Ebola health campaign. One of the sources said that a similar mix-up had occurred in late 2014. The government did not respond to a question about whether it had happened before. . Guinea has received less financial aid than other Ebola countries, with $266 million in commitments - about half that for Sierra Leone and a third of Liberia’s total, according to the U.N. financial tracking service. . France is providing technical support to its former colony, but it has not launched a military operation like Britain did for Sierra Leone and the United States did in Liberia. . The WHO said the mistake was not detected in the Donka laboratory, which tested both sets of samples, where technicians had received a “huge amount of samples”. . The laboratory is run by Guinea and supported by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar – a foundation created in 2009 by a statute signed between Senegal and France’s Institut Pasteur. . Dr. Andre Spiegel, director of the Institut Pasteur Dakar, declined to comment, saying the information was sensitive and confidential. . Guinea’s Keita said the WHO had sent a supervisor to assist the laboratory.  . Another Western official in Guinea said partners in a Guinea anti-Ebola drug test were now nervous about extending it to other centers in Guinea such as Coyah. . Dr. Dan Kelly, founder of the Wellbody Alliance providing healthcare in Sierra Leone, said it was not unusual for centers to run out of test tubes, but procedures existed.  . “Stock outs happen. What you are supposed to do is wait for the right colored tubes to arrive,” he said. |Mon Mar 02 18:00:37 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Guinea says Ebola patients sent home after botched blood tests |5.7245648890566656e+17|http://reut.rs/1DwR9GN
Kathryn Doyle|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Teenagers in North Carolina who try to buy electronic cigarettes online are likely to succeed even though selling the devices to minors is illegal in the state, researchers reported on Monday. . A 2013 North Carolina law required that online e-cigarette sellers verify customers’ ages with a government database at the point of order. But more than 90 percent of vendors do not comply, researchers led by Rebecca Williams of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found. . “It is likely easier for many teens to buy e-cigarettes online than in a corner store, where they might be faced with a request for ID,” Williams said. . The situation is likely similar in other states, she added. . While 41 states ban e-cigarette sales to minors, “they tend to focus on face-to-face sales,” imposing fewer or no restrictions for online sales, said Camille Gourdet, a health policy researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago who was not involved in the study. . North Carolina is one of the few states that address remote sales, she said, and vendors shipping to minors there could be charged with a class 2 misdemeanor. . For the study, published online in JAMA Pediatrics, researchers supervised 11 teens ages 14 to 17 as they attempted to buy e-cigarettes online 98 times. They succeeded 75 times; 18 failures had to do with broken websites or payment processing. . Only five failures resulted from age verification measures such as requesting a social security number and date of birth, meaning 94 percent of the vendors failed to vet ages properly. . Other sites had some form of age verification, though they were ineffective, such as check boxes. None required drivers license numbers at the time of purchase. . “Without strictly enforced federal regulations, online e-cigarette vendors have little motivation to decrease profits by spending the time and money it takes to properly verify customers’ age and reject underage buyers,” Williams said via  e-mail. . The packages were delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service Inc, DHL Worldwide Express, or FedEx Corp, which do not ship traditional cigarettes to consumers under their own policies or federal regulation. None attempted to verify consumer age, and almost all left the packages at the door. . No federal law restricts e-cigarette shipping. |Mon Mar 02 16:57:32 +0000 2015||U.S. minors easily buy e-cigarettes online: UNC study |5.72440613465002e+17|http://reut.rs/1DwseTH
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Peanuts may reduce the risk of death from heart disease, a large study found, suggesting that the health benefits of this low-cost nut may be similar to pricier options like almonds and pistachios.  . While previous studies have linked nut consumption to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, the earlier research focused mostly on wealthier white people in the U.S. and Europe. This study, with a more ethnically and economically diverse population in the U.S. and China, suggests that nuts can benefit people from a wide variety of backgrounds.  . “We can now tell people that peanuts are just as good as more expensive tree nuts, and that the benefit isn’t just for white, upper class people, it’s for everybody,” said senior study author Dr. Xiao-Ou Shu, a professor of epidemiology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, in a phone interview.  . Shu’s team studied 71,764 people in the southeastern U.S. – mostly low-income, and about two-thirds African-American – and 134,265 residents of Shanghai.  . They looked at how many grams of peanuts (including peanut butter) and other nuts participants ate on an average day and sorted them into five groups ranging from a low of less than 0.95 grams to a high of at least 18.45 grams. . A peanut – which is technically not a nut (it’s a legume) - weighs about one gram, and there are about 28 peanuts in a one ounce serving. . The Chinese participants ate far fewer nuts than the Americans, and in both countries women generally ate less than men. Average daily nut consumption ranged from a low of 1.6 grams for Chinese women to a high of 16.4 grams for white men in the U.S. south.  . In the American study, half the people were tracked for at least five years. In the Chinese group, half were tracked for six to 12 years. For the Americans, the risk of dying from any cause was 21 percent lower in the group that ate the most peanuts, compared to the group that ate the least. For the Chinese, the risk reduction was 17 percent. . Nuts and peanuts also lowered the risk of death from strokes and heart disease in both study groups, but not the risk of death from cancer or diabetes. . Peanut butter didn’t curb the risk of death, however, possibly because it contained sugar or hydrogenated fat “or some other added ingredients that nullified the benefit,” said Dr. David Maron, director of preventive cardiology at Stanford University School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . Natural peanut butter, which has no added ingredients, might be just as beneficial as peanuts, Maron said in a phone interview.  . The study didn’t randomly compare peanut eaters to people who don’t eat peanuts, which is the gold standard method for proving a benefit. An observational study like this can’t prove that eating peanuts caused people to live longer. Still, the results, added to findings from previous research, make a compelling argument for including nuts in a healthy diet, said Dr. Mitchell Katz, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, who wrote a commentary published with the study in JAMA Internal Medicine.  . “Because most of the previous research was done on people of high socioeconomic status, there has been an assumption that maybe people who eat nuts are also doing other things that might help them live longer, like exercising more or following a healthier diet,” Katz told Reuters Health by phone. “This study tells us that the nuts are beneficial, and it’s not just because of the type of people who eat the nuts.” . Dietary guidelines emphasizing low-fat foods may have led some people to avoid nuts, even though the kind of fat in nuts is healthy, said Dr. Ethan Weiss of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . “We have forever been told not to eat nuts because (they’re) fatty and high in calories, but that is getting blown up,” Weiss said by phone. “It now turns out that it is really good for you to eat nuts and peanuts.” .

Frederik Joelving|(Reuters Health) - Renting out their wombs may ease financial problems for poor women in India, but new research suggests surrogate mothers there are unaware of the risks and often left out of key medical decisions about their pregnancy. . “Of the 14 surrogate mothers I interviewed, not a single one could explain the risks from having multiple embryos placed in their uterus, or having a fetal reduction or a Cesarean section,” said Dr. Malene Tanderup from Aarhus University in Denmark. . “Pregnancy is the most dangerous time in a woman’s life,” she told Reuters Health. “They have to know what they are agreeing to.” . Most countries ban commercial surrogacy, but India remains a popular destination for “rent-a-womb” tourism, which brings in an estimated $500 million to $2.3 billion annually. . The women in India who become surrogate mothers are mostly poor and uneducated. The $3,000 to $7,000 they typically earn can mean a vastly improved living situation, education for their children or the chance to start a small business. . Yet large payments to fertility clinics and lack of regulation raise worries that surrogate mothers are being exploited.  . New findings reported in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica fuel those concerns. . “This article shows the ground reality in a very stark manner,” said Dr. Amar Jesani, editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, who was not involved in the study. . He said lack of truly informed consent to medical procedures is a widespread problem in India. “I’m not surprised at all by the findings,” Jesani told Reuters Health.  . In Tanderup’s study, none of the surrogate mothers knew how many embryos had been transferred, or the complications of multifetal pregnancy or fetal reduction. . That’s a problem, Tanderup says, because the 18 clinics she visited typically transferred several embryos at a time - in one case as many as seven.  . With each additional fetus, risks to mothers and babies climb. Babies from multiple pregnancies are more likely to be premature or have cerebral palsy or learning disabilities, and mothers have higher risks of high blood pressure, diabetes or postpartum bleeding. . When Tanderup asked doctors if they told surrogate mothers how many embryos they transfer, one answered: “No, we never ask them and they are not even informed how many are going to be transferred. They are illiterate, uneducated girls.” . Two-thirds of clinics decided how many embryos to transfer without consulting the commissioning parents or the surrogates. Four said they asked the commissioning parents, and only one included the surrogate mothers. . Clinics typically reduce the number of fetuses according to commissioning parents’ wishes. A lethal solution is injected into unwanted fetuses around week 10 of pregnancy.  . Fetal reduction is generally considered safe, but it carries a small risk of infection and loss of the remaining fetuses. Because surrogate mothers are paid monthly during pregnancy, they get less money if they miscarry.  . Only three clinics involved surrogates in decisions about reduction.  . In one case, when a woman carrying twins wanted a reduction, the agent and doctor refused. Instead, they offered an additional 50,000 rupees ($809) plus a C-section, which she accepted. As one doctor explained, if the commissioning parents get twins, “it is two in one shot, they don’t have to spend that money again.” . But whether the extra payment “makes up for the extra risks is unclear,” Tanderup said. . A twin pregnancy in India almost invariably leads to a C-section, she explained. Afterward, mothers shouldn’t lift heavy things for a while and might not be able to return to daily duties right away. And should they get pregnant again, they’ll typically need another C-section. . The contract says nothing about who pays for that procedure or for infections or other complications after delivery, Tanderup added. . An earlier study from India found that surrogacy contracts rarely addressed the health and wellbeing of the surrogate mother. . Jesani, from the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, said the findings cast both commissioning parents and doctors in an unflattering light. . “The doctors seem to be more loyal to the commissioning parents than to the surrogates,” said Jesani, also at the Centre for Studies in Ethics and Rights in Mumbai.  . He added, “A large number of commissioning parents are Indian, I’m not saying this is only foreigners.” . Legislation to regulate the Indian surrogacy market - the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill - has been pending for years, with activists arguing it’s too soft and industry taking the opposite view. . In the meantime, business may pick up. Last month Thailand outlawed surrogacy services for foreigners following several scandals, including an Australian couple that allegedly abandoned a baby with Down syndrome with his Thai mother but took his healthy twin home with them.  .

Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - For people who are financially strapped, time challenged or on the road without a gym in sight, fitness experts say streaming videos can provide cheap or free workouts, leaving no excuses for even the most dedicated couch potatoes to avoid exercise. . Streaming videos cater for tastes ranging from aerobics to the dance exercise Zumba and are as portable as a smartphone. . To emphasize how accessible it is, the streaming site for Dirty Yoga features a pizza take-out box. . “It’s online yoga delivered to you, wherever you are,” said Jess Gronholm, yoga teacher and co-founder of the site that was launched more than two years ago. “Our idea was to remove as many barriers and make it as convenient as we can.” . Not everyone has the time or money to go to a gym on a regular basis, Gronholm said, and online exercise is flexible in a way traditional gyms are not. . Miami-based fitness instructor Jessica Smith streams a variety of workouts from cardio blasts to kettlebells through JessicaSmithTV over both YouTube and paid digital download. She has also released her latest program, “Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan,” as a digital download and DVD. . Smith said the YouTube Channel makes up only about eight to 10 percent of her company’s revenue, through Google Ads, but the platform builds her community. . “Streaming faces many of the same challenges that the fitness DVD market did. Consumers are faced with the distractions of home workouts, (as well as) multiple programs, instructors, fads, and trends to choose from,” she added. . Many home exercisers outside urban centers also do not have fast enough Internet to play streaming videos in real time which poses another problem.  . Crunch Live, a service of the national chain of fitness centers called Crunch, streams some 65 videos of its varied, signature workouts. . Donna Cyrus, senior vice president of programming, said the service, which is free to members and costs non-members $9.95 a month, appeals to people who travel, or do not feel fit enough to enter a gym, or who do not live near a club. . Gronholm believes the future of streaming is spacious enough to accommodate all workout tastes and styles. . “We’re not trying to be everything to everyone. We’re very niche,” he said about his yoga site. “As streaming becomes easier to do, I think it is definitely the way of the future.”  |Mon Mar 02 13:19:13 +0000 2015||Streaming fitness videos leave no excuses for procrastinators |5.723856727089234e+17|http://reut.rs/1DvdV1C
Syed Raza Hassan|ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has wasted $3.7 million worth of vaccines donated to protect children from deadly diseases because officials failed to store them properly, a senior health official told Reuters on Monday. . The scandal is the latest problem to be exposed in Pakistan’s poorly run public health services.  . “We have suspended the officials concerned and are conducting an inquiry,” Saira Afzal Tarar, minister of state for national health services, told Reuters. . The ruined vaccines were pentavalent vaccines, which combine different vaccines in one injection and are supposed to protect children against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and a bacteria that causes meningitis and pneumonia.  . It must be stored at cold temperatures to remain effective but Pakistan’s power sector is chronically mismanaged and the country suffers several hours of power cuts a day.  . Officials said the vaccines were exposed to fluctuating temperatures, possibly because of faulty generators.  . “There may have been issue with the generators, but the facts will become clear after the inquiry,” said Dr Saqlain Ahmad Gilani, the national program manager at the Expanded Program on Immunization.  . He said 1.3 million doses of vaccine worth $3.7 million had been wasted. They had been donated by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). . UNICEF says one in 10 Pakistani children does not survive their fifth birthday. The majority of deaths are due to easily treatable diseases. . Last year, an international agency branded the government’s management of a national polio campaign “disastrous”. . Doctors also say patients are regularly exposed to infected blood as authorities fail to monitor blood banks.    |Mon Mar 02 13:19:13 +0000 2015||Pakistan wastes $3.7 million worth of donated vaccine, official says |5.7238567102283366e+17|http://reut.rs/1Cio4Ua
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc’s application to expand the use of its post-surgery pain drug, Exparel, sending the company’s stock down more than 16 percent on Monday. . Exparel is currently injected directly into tissue at the site of an operation, a technique known as infiltration. Pacira applied to expand its use as a nerve-numbing injection, or nerve block, in March last year. . Nerve blocks work by introducing a local anesthetic close to a nerve, allowing the drug to control pain in a specific region of the body, such as the upper arm, thigh or lower leg. . The FDA’s rejection could delay approval for the nerve block indication by at least a year, Canaccord Genuity analyst Corey Davis said. . Exparel, which was approved in April 2012 for post-surgical pain, generated 95 percent of Pacira’s nearly $197.6 million in revenue last year. . The drug’s main indication is still the company’s primary revenue driver, Pacira said. . Pacira said last week that it expected Exparel sales to rise to $310-$330 million in 2015, with about 10 percent of the projected revenue coming from the expanded use of the drug. . The company said on Monday that it would work with the FDA to secure approval for the new indication, allowing Exparel to be used in a wider range of post-operative patients. . The drug combines a local anesthetic, bupivacaine, with the company’s DepoFoam technology, a drug delivery system that releases the medicine over a period of time. . Pacira’s stock was down 15 percent on Monday afternoon and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. |Mon Mar 02 12:18:26 +0000 2015||FDA rejects Pacira's application for expanded use of pain drug |5.7237037432064e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ci8asQ
Toni Clarke|(Reuters) - Manufacturers’ tests of procedures to clean medical scopes linked with “superbug” outbreaks contained flaws that render their cleaning instructions unreliable, according to a senior official with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . The scopes were linked to the exposure of 179 patients to drug-resistant bacteria at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles and may have contributed to two deaths. Those incidents were announced last month. . In early 2014, following a superbug outbreak at a hospital in Illinois, the FDA asked Fujifilm Holdings Corp, Olympus Corp and Pentax, which make the devices, to submit their test results for review, Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the agency’s chief scientist, said in an interview. .     In some cases the tests were poorly carried out. In others, they were properly conducted but the cleaning and disinfecting protocol failed, said Ostroff, who will become the FDA’s acting commissioner when Dr. Margaret Hamburg leaves at the end of March. . The deficiencies in the companies’ tests has not been reported. .     The flawed data calls into question the reliability of all current cleaning and disinfecting protocols and expose a weakness in the FDA’s regulation of such devices - one which the agency is now moving to close. . The FDA has said that even when hospitals adhered to the manufacturers’ instructions for cleaning scopes, patients have contracted multidrug-resistant bacterial infections from the devices, but the agency had not detailed manufacturers’ tests of their own procedures. . Under guidance issued in 1996, companies making duodenoscopes did not have to submit data, but merely attest that cleaning protocols used in their own studies were effective. The companies set their own standards for effectiveness.  . After the Illinois outbreak, the FDA said it would require duodenoscope manufacturers to provide underlying test data at the time they apply for marketing approval. And it has imposed specific benchmarks by which effectiveness should be measured. . Among those benchmarks: the agency expects to see the elimination of 99.9999 percent of microbes at each of several locations on the scope. . “We have set a higher bar to demonstrate adequate validation than was expected in the past based on evolving science and experiences with more recent outbreaks,” Ostroff said. “What was acceptable a few years ago is not adequate today.” . A spokeswoman for Fujifilm, Diane Rainey, said it is working with the FDA to evaluate and respond to concerns about contamination concerns associated with the instruments and that patient safety “is, and always will be, Fujifilm’s primary consideration.” . Representatives from Pentax and Olympus did not respond to requests for comment after business hours on Sunday. . Ostroff told Reuters the FDA plans to convene a panel of outside scientific advisors to review the safety of the devices “to put all the available information on the table and have a discussion about it.” . The FDA’s advisory committees counsel the agency on a variety of scientific and regulatory issues, including drug and device approvals and safety matters. The agency is not required to follow recommendations made by its advisors, but typically does so. . No date has been set for the meeting, which will be public, Ostroff said. . The problems the advisory committee will likely be asked to consider do not appear easy to fix. . The companies still have not come up with validated cleaning and disinfecting protocols. The FDA found initial data submitted by the companies inadequate and asked them to test the protocols again using a more robust methodology. Those results were also unsatisfactory. . They have been asked to try again, and the process will continue until a reliably safe protocol is found, Ostroff said. . Duodenoscopes are threaded through the mouth, throat and stomach to the top of the small intestine and are used to drain fluid from pancreatic and biliary ducts. They have been associated with episodic infections for more than a decade, but those infections could often be treated with antibiotics. . That is no longer always the case. An increasing number of bacteria are resistant to drugs, including a family of germs known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, the bacteria implicated in the outbreak announced last month at UCLA and the 2013 outbreak at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago. . In addition to prompting the FDA to ask companies to submit their underlying validation data, the Illinois outbreak prompted the agency to examine the design of the devices. Its assessment is ongoing but has already raised red flags, Ostroff said. . It is far from clear whether design changes would be effective: companies have modified the devices before with no discernible results. .     In 2004 Fujifilm received FDA clearance for a change that would seal an open channel in the device to keep out bodily fluids. In 2009, the FDA cleared a similar change by Pentax. .     Olympus, whose devices were used in the UCLA outbreak, made the change in 2010, though it did not file for FDA clearance until last October after being notified about the omission by the agency. The application has not yet received clearance, but Ostroff said the FDA has not removed the device from the market because doing so could create a shortage. |Mon Mar 02 06:38:35 +0000 2015||Companies' tests used in 'superbug' scope cleaning flawed: FDA |5.72284848938881e+17|http://reut.rs/1DtxYO7
Misha Hussain|MACENTA, Guinea (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a land where witchcraft is sought after more than science for curing illness, medicine men in Guinea say the Ebola epidemic would be over by now if they had been properly included in the outbreak response. . From broken bones to impotence to madness, these traditional healers say they have a potion, spell or touch for many ailments Western doctors can’t treat. But there’s only one cure for Ebola they say: knowledge. . In the forest region of southeastern Guinea, where the virus was detected last March, disseminating information using modern technology has proved challenging, resulting in the disease outstaying its welcome. . Karamoko Ibrahima Fofana, president of the association of traditional healers in the town of Macenta, said guérisseurs, as they are known, have unique access to remote villages. . “Guérisseurs are often the first port of call for the sick,” said Fofana, 69, who is also an imam at the central mosque in Macenta, a hot, dusty town carved out of the forest. . “We could have spread information on how to protect against Ebola or told people with symptoms to seek help in the treatment centers.”  . Instead, the traditional healers were sometimes accused of spreading the deadly virus. After all, it was the claim of a guérisseur in Sierra Leone that she could cure Ebola that drew the first Guinean victims across the border, Fofana recalled. . Ebola has infected more than 23,500 people in West Africa and killed over 9,500, nearly all in the three worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is transmitted through blood, vomit, diarrhea and other bodily fluids. . Health officials are exploring ways to prevent similar disease outbreaks around the world, with epidemics expected to be a focus at a global conference on disaster risk reduction in Japan later this month. . Fofana admits the guérisseurs in his association didn’t know what Ebola was at first, but after training from United Nations staff they’re keen to spread information - and not the virus. . “If a guérisseur has been trained on Ebola and is then caught treating a suspected case, they are fined 50,000 GNF ($7), stripped of their membership and reported to the police,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   . Jean Marie Dangou, head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Guinea, said the “Stop Ebola” campaign based on modern communication technology, had all but failed. . “For about one year the main communication strategy was built around media, mainly radio and TV, but it wasn’t successful. The country is still dealing with tough and repetitive resistance,” Dangou said. . West Africa has recorded some weekly declines in new confirmed cases of Ebola since the start of 2015, but resistance in some communities has undermined efforts to end the epidemic. . The main message from this outbreak is that communication must be adapted to fit the local culture, Dangou said. . Word of mouth may be a better way of getting information out than modern methods in parts of the world where broadcast signals are weak and power for electrical appliances is scarce. . “Lessons learned from Ebola in Guinea can be applied to cholera, malaria or any other infectious disease in other parts of the world that rely on an oral tradition,” Dangou added.  . At the start of the outbreak, traditional healers were viewed as part of the problem, rather than being recruited to help halt the disease.  . “Our communication was top down and the way we delivered the messages was wrong. We told people to stop doing things without explaining why,” Dangou told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . In a shift in policy, community leaders, including healers, are given information and asked to act on it as they see fit. As a result, many have appropriated the “Stop Ebola” messages. . Traditional healers are also supplementing disease surveillance and helping response teams that search for cases. . “Most traditional healers are now aware of the risk of treating Ebola patients. More and more patients are coming to health facilities after a referral from their healer,” said Dangou.  . Given their important role in efforts to stamp out Ebola, the services of traditional healers should come at a price, said Joseph Souro Mamadouno, 58, a Catholic guérisseur from Macenta. . “Ebola is here today, but it could be cholera tomorrow. We can spread health messages, but the government should cover costs of transport, food and the time we take off work,” said Mamadouno, who also works at the local agriculture school. . According to the healers’ association, some 2,000 herbal practitioners in Macenta, a district with a population of around 300,000 close to the Liberian border, are out of pocket as a result of the Ebola response. . Ebola shares symptoms with less serious diseases traditional healers say they can treat: fatigue, fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhea. But now these cases are referred to hospitals. . Koly Beavogui, 80, an animist traditional healer from Macenta said she and other female guérisseurs have been reduced to begging for food from neighbors and foraging in the forest. . The scrawny woman, with a wrinkled face and toothless smile, used to treat five to six people a day, but now hardly sees anyone. . “When the sick come to see me, I only ask them to give me whatever they can afford, because we don’t buy illness, so we shouldn’t have to pay for treatments,” said Beavogui, sitting outside her freshly-swept, mudbrick house. . But others are fearful of turning Ebola into an industry. . “I’m not in favor of incentives, because it looks like we are in an Ebola business. These people should become agents of change, in their own community, without any kind of payment,” the WHO’s Dangou said. |Mon Mar 02 06:38:34 +0000 2015||Africa's medicine men key to halting Ebola spread in Guinea |5.7228484718986035e+17|http://reut.rs/1CgLCZt
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Many parents ask doctors to spread out toddlers’ vaccines instead of following the recommended immunization schedule, according to a new study. . Most doctors comply with the request, even though they believe the delays put the children at risk for preventable diseases and make the experience more painful, the researchers report in the journal Pediatrics. . Only about 2 to 3 percent of parents actually refuse vaccines, said study leader Dr. Allison Kempe. But, she added, “there is an increasing number of parents asking to deviate from the schedule in other ways.” . Kempe, from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Colorado, had expected that most doctors would get such requests from parents, but not this often. . “I was surprised by over 20 percent of doctors saying 10 percent or more of their families (had asked) to spread out vaccines,” she said. . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends several shots during the first years of life to protect against diseases (PDF link: . ). The schedule is backed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which publishes Pediatrics. . The AAP says the vaccine schedule is designed to work best with children’s immune systems while protecting them from diseases as soon as possible. . The new report comes as the U.S. battles a large measles outbreak that had infected 154 people from 17 states and Washington, D.C. as of February 20, according to the CDC. The outbreak is tied to Disneyland in Anaheim, California. . For the study, Kempe and colleagues, in collaboration with the CDC, sent surveys to 815 pediatricians and family doctors across the U.S. in 2012. They received 534 completed surveys. . Overall, 93 percent of doctors reported at least one parental request to space out the immunizations of a child younger than two years old. And 21 percent of those doctors said at least 10 percent of families made the request. . The doctors said parents had a variety of reasons for deviating from the recommended schedule, including concerns about complications and a belief that their children won’t get a vaccine-preventable disease. . Most doctors responding to the survey felt it’s not in the child’s best interest to space out vaccines, but most comply with the parents’ wishes at least sometimes. . The percentage of doctors who often or always agree to spread out vaccines more than doubled from 13 percent in a similar 2009 survey to 37 percent in the current report. . Doctors said they tried to educate parents on the importance of following the recommended vaccine schedule, but few felt they had any effective approaches. . “A lot of them feel what they’re doing isn’t making a difference,” Kempe said, adding that organizations like the AAP have recommended techniques for discussing vaccines. . “I am not convinced that we have the right methods to counter this,” she said.  . She said several techniques need to be combined, including education during pregnancy, more responsible reporting by the media, limiting the use of philosophical exemptions, and better collaboration between the public and health department. . “It can’t all fall on the primary care doctors’ backs,” Kempe said. “It’s too big and too time consuming of an issue.” .

|"(Reuters) - Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc, a retailer of hardwood flooring in North America, sold flooring with higher levels of formaldehyde than permitted under California’s health and safety standards, according to television news program “60 Minutes”. .

James Pearson|SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is ending a ban on foreign tourists imposed more than four months ago because of worries about the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, two tour operators and a source in regular contact with North Korean officials said on Monday. . North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated countries and is thousands of miles from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It has reported no cases of the virus, which has killed more than 9,000 people. .     However, its borders have been closed to foreign tourists since last October for fear the virus might spread and it imposes a strict 21-day quarantine for foreign aid workers and diplomats, who have been told to stay in embassy compounds. . The source, who requested anonymity, said he had been told the Ebola travel restrictions had been lifted. . Koryo Tours, a Chinese-based travel agency that specializes in taking Western tourists to the isolated country, said it had been told to expect an announcement regarding the ban later on Monday. . “Our contacts in the country have informed us to expect that we should hear news later today that North Korea will be reopening its borders after a more than four-month closure due to Ebola,” Koryo Tours co-founder Nick Bonner told Reuters. . “The National Tourism Administration in Pyongyang contacted us this morning to let us know that there is some movement in the border policy,” he said.      . Chinese-based Young Pioneer Tours had similar information. . “We have heard that Ebola has been dismissed as a concern by the government this morning and today it is expected to be made official and the border suspension to be lifted,” the company’s manager, Troy Collings, told Reuters by email. . “The decision has been made but not yet passed down through official channels,” he added.  . It was not immediately clear if the lifting of the measures applied to foreign diplomats and businessmen, Bonner said. |Mon Mar 02 03:31:29 +0000 2015||North Korea ending Ebola travel restrictions: source, tour firm |5.722377650117714e+17|http://reut.rs/1DsOn5l
Deena Beasley|(Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s Kyprolis helped patients with relapsed multiple myeloma live twice as long before their blood cancer worsened compared to a regimen containing rival drug Velcade, according to an interim analysis announced by the company on Sunday. . Kyprolis, the centerpiece of Amgen’s nearly $10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, had sales last year of $331 million. Velcade, sold by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co and Johnson & Johnson, had 2014 sales of nearly $3 billion. . The interim look showed that patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with Kyprolis and chemotherapy dexamethasone lived for a median of 18.7 months before their disease worsened, compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with Velcade and the chemotherapy drug. . Amgen said the study has yet to show a difference in  survival between the two groups, but said it did demonstrate superiority for Kyprolis in secondary goals of higher overall response rate and lower incidence of nerve pain. . Sean Harper, Amgen’s head of research and development, said the study will continue until overall survival can be determined. . “This was the bet we made when we acquired Onyx,” he said. “To be able to demonstrate something compelling enough with respect to the difference between Kyprolis and Velcade,” which will lose U.S. patent protection in 2017. . Rates of cardiac failure and kidney failure for Kyprolis were higher than for patients treated with Velcade. There was also an increase in the incidence of hypertension and shortness of breath in the Kyprolis group compared to Velcade. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2012, granted Kyprolis accelerated approval for use in multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer, after prior therapies  stopped working. The Amgen drug has a wholesale price of over $10,000 a month. . Amgen filed earlier this year for FDA approval of Kyprolis as a second-line myeloma treatment based on positive results from a study comparing the drug in combination with dexamethasone and Celgene Corp’s Revlimid, to a regimen containing just Revlimid and the chemotherapy drug. . Results from a head-to-head trial comparing Kyprolis to Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are likely to come in 2016, Harper said. . Takeda has announced positive results from a trial of its oral version of Velcade, which like Kyprolis, must be given by infusion. Harper said Amgen expects that oral drugs in this class, proteosome inhibitors, will likely be used as “maintenance” treatments for myeloma patients whose disease is first controlled by existing, infused drugs.  . “Demonstrating superiority over Velcade in this head-to-head trial supports our goal of ensuring continued improvement of patient outcomes and potentially establishing Kyprolis as the backbone of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma,” Pablo Cagnoni, president of Amgen’s Onyx unit, said in a statement.   |Mon Mar 02 00:26:42 +0000 2015||Amgen says Kyprolis doubles progression-free survival vs Velcade |5.721912643529605e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ds8noC
|DALLAS (Reuters) - The first person infected with Ebola in the United States, nurse Nina Pham, said she was used for publicity purposes by her hospital, which also invaded her privacy and did not properly train her, the Dallas Morning News reported on Sunday. . Pham, 26, told the newspaper that chaos hit the Dallas hospital when it admitted Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after he contracted it in Liberia. Nurses were ill prepared and received little guidance on how to treat Ebola or protect themselves.  . “I wanted to believe that they would have my back and take care of me, but they just haven’t risen to the occasion,” Pham told The Dallas Morning News in an exclusive interview published in its Sunday edition. . Duncan was put into isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in late September and died less than two weeks later.  . Pham, who became infected while treating him, later recovered and was welcomed in the Oval Office by President Barack Obama.  . She is planning to sue the hospital, the paper said. The hospital has reached a settlement with Duncan’s family. . The hospital did not address details of Pham’s allegations. It said in statement: “Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.” . Pham said nurses initially did not wear hazmat suits when treating Duncan and went in with double gloves taped to double gowns, double booties and face shields. Pham said her neck area was exposed, the newspaper said. . Hazmat suits came a few days later but meanwhile, medical waste piled up in a hospital room because maintenance staff would not collect it.  . “We were mopping floors with bleach and doing janitorial work and dealing with hazardous, lethal waste,” Pham told the paper.  . Another nurse who treated Duncan, Amber Vinson, also became infected with Ebola and recovered. . Pham said the hospital did not respect her right to privacy. In one instance, she was videotaped speaking to a doctor and the video was released to the media. Pham said it was done without her permission. . Charla Aldous, Pham’s attorney told the paper the hospital “used Nina as a PR pawn.” . Pham said she is also experiencing symptoms such as body aches and high liver enzymes as a result of experimental medication she received. |Sun Mar 01 19:36:35 +0000 2015||Texas Ebola nurse says hospital failed her and her colleagues |5.721182545394442e+17|http://reut.rs/1CelQVP
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - (Corrects in paragraphs 1 and 7 of Feb 26, 2015 story , that the doctors surveyed for the study were in The Netherlands, not Norway.) . Depression could be clouding the last 24 hours of life for a significant number of people with advanced cancer, pointing to a need for better – and earlier - psychological help, according to a large study in The Netherlands. . Although it’s challenging to tease apart depression symptoms from the pain, fatigue and cognitive problems associated with end-stage cancer, more can be done to alleviate depression and anxiety, researchers said.  . “Health care providers may think this is a normal part of the dying process,” said lead author Dr. Elene Janberidze from the European Palliative Care Research Center at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. . “However, some patients experiencing depressive symptoms and/or depression can be treated and thus both the patients and their families may have a better quality of life,” Janberidze told Reuters Health in an email. . Previous studies have estimated the rates of depression in patients with advanced cancer at anywhere from 2 percent to 56 percent, she and her colleagues write in the journal BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care.   . Janberidze said that her team chose to focus on patients in their last 24 hours of life because this group had not been well investigated. . They used data from a 2005 nationwide Dutch survey of doctors who had signed the death certificates of patients that died within the past two months. The researchers examined data on 1,363 cancer patients during their last 24 hours of life, assessing the symptoms reported by their attending physicians and rating their level of depression.    . After accounting for symptoms of the individuals’ illness, the researchers found that overall 37 percent of patients were depressed. More women than men were severely or very severely depressed, and patients aged 17 to 65 were more likely to be moderately depressed than those 80 years or older.  . Geriatricians were four times more likely than other doctors to assess their patients as seriously or severely depressed. Pain specialists, palliative care consultants, psychiatrists and psychologists were also more often tending to patients with symptoms of serious depression than to those with mild or moderate depression.   . Mild or moderately depressed patients were more likely to feel tired, anxious and confused than those without depression symptoms. Individuals who were severely or very severely depressed also tended to feel anxious.   . Holly Prigerson, who directs the Center for Research on End-of-Life Care at Cornell University, said she admired the authors for trying to gauge depression in cancer patients who were so close to death. . “The study is novel in that it evaluates retrospectively the depressive symptom severity of patients within 24 hours of death,” Prigerson said in an e-mail to Reuters Health. “I’m unaware of any other study that has attempted this.”  . But Prigerson also noted some of the study’s limitations, such as trying to assess patients who could be unconscious or delirious, have multiple organ failure and difficulty communicating their emotions.  . Physicians also need to distinguish physical and psychological symptoms and might not always have enough information on a patient’s psychological state when they are dying or might not have enough training to diagnose their “psychological distress,” she said. . “It is also difficult to draw conclusions regarding the clinical implications of the study,”  Prigerson said. “Given patients are actively dying, it is doubtful that a psychosocial intervention or administration of an antidepressant will effectively improve the patients’ quality of death. . “Psychosocial interventions and care in the months and weeks leading up to the death can have a profound impact on patients’ quality of life prior to death, however,” Prigerson said. . Janberidze said doctors should be checking cancer patients for physical and psychological pain and integrating palliative care with their cancer management earlier in their disease. She also said family members could help monitor the patient’s pain. . “In general it is important for family members with loved ones who have advanced stage cancer to pay attention to the signs and symptoms of depression and inform healthcare providers immediately. Doctors should investigate the patient further and recommend psychological interventions as needed,” Janberidze said. . SOURCE: .

|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone’s Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana said on Saturday that he had placed himself in a 21-day quarantine after one of his bodyguards died of Ebola amid a worrying recent surge in new infections in the West African nation.  . Cases of Ebola, which has killed nearly 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea during a year-long epidemic, have fallen off sharply in recent weeks.  . Of 99 new confirmed Ebola cases in the region during the week to Feb. 22, however, 63 were in Sierra Leone according to the World Health Organization’s weekly report. . Sam-Sumana’s bodyguard John Koroma died early this week. . “I have decided to be put under quarantine because I do not want to take chances and I want to lead by example,” the vice president told Reuters. “I am very well and showing no signs of illness.” . Sam-Sumana said his entire staff will also be placed under observation and anyone showing symptoms of the disease would be tested.  . The vice president is the country’s first senior government figure to subject himself to a voluntary quarantine. However, officials in neighboring Liberia, including the chief medical officer and transport minister, were placed under observation late last year.  . Faced with a wave of new infections, particularly in the capital Freetown and some districts in the north, the government reintroduced a number of restrictions that had been lifted earlier this year as the epidemic appeared to ease. . A statement from President Ernest Bai Koroma’s office late on Friday ordered public transport operators to reduce capacity by 25 percent to limit physical contact between passengers.  . The government also placed a night-time curfew on unloading goods from commercial vehicles and limited the movements of water transport. |Sat Feb 28 20:09:06 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone vice president places himself in Ebola quarantine |5.717640493373194e+17|http://reut.rs/1C9PaN4
|BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Saturday it would implement drug distribution reforms including centralization measures designed to cut prices and reduce corruption. . The State Council, China’s cabinet, said it urged drug manufacturers to negotiate directly with hospitals on payment for pharmaceuticals instead of going through middle men. . Authorities should also work to ensure the distribution of drugs to remote rural areas with underdeveloped modes of transportation in a timely fashion, the State Council said on its website. . Authorities should push forward centralization and standardization measures in an effort to weed out corruption and lower prices, it added. . Fragmentation in China’s drug distribution has caused market inefficiencies. High drug prices have fueled a gray market for pharmaceuticals and caused tension with patients. . Beijing has said it plans to invest in rural healthcare to improve access to care for those in remote areas. . Critics say bribery and other forms of corruption are rife in the healthcare sector, fueled by low pay for doctors and nurses. China has cracked down on high prices and corruption in the sector over the past year and in September fined GlaxoSmithKline Plc a record 3 billion yuan ($489 million) for paying bribes to doctors to use its drugs.  |Sat Feb 28 14:36:00 +0000 2015||China says to implement drug distribution reforms |5.716802183704576e+17|http://reut.rs/1C8F2UI
|MUMBAI (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge has denied Indian generic drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd’s bid to reinstate approvals granted to it to launch the first copies of the heartburn drug Nexium and the antiviral Valcyte, a court document showed. . Judge Beryl Howell of the United States District Court for the District of Colombia on Friday also blocked Ranbaxy’s plea for a preliminary injunction to halt Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Endo International Plc and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd from launching copies of the two drugs.  . The court decision came after Ranbaxy sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November for pulling approvals that would have allowed the Indian firm to launch the first copies of Roche’s Valcyte and AstraZeneca Plc’s Nexium. . Launching the first generic copies of the drugs would have given Ranbaxy six months of exclusivity on the market. . FDA had said its earlier decision granting the approvals was “in error” as Ranbaxy’s plants at the time were not compliant with the U.S. regulator’s manufacturing quality standards. . Ranbaxy, which is being acquired by larger rival Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on Saturday. . The company, which has been hit by a series of regulatory sanctions in the past year due to poor production practices at its India-based plants, was expected to hugely benefit from the launch of Valcyte and Nexium copies. . Ranbaxy has previously said it was working on resolving issues at its India plants, all of which are banned from exporting to the United States, its largest market. |Sat Feb 28 06:11:42 +0000 2015||U.S. judge denies Ranbaxy bid to reinstate approvals for Valcyte, Nexium copies |5.7155330938496614e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dkkrs6
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters) - Regardless of how they frame the discussion, doctors who deliver bad news may be seen as less compassionate by their patients, a new study suggests. . Patients who watched videos of fictional interactions between doctors and patients felt the doctors delivering bad news were less compassionate than those giving good news, researchers found. . Until recently, doctors and researchers believed that doctors who delivered bad news in an empathetic tone would be seen as sincere, said Dr. Eduardo Bruera, the study’s lead author from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. . But it seems the news itself has an impact on the way patients see doctors. . The researchers showed 100 cancer patients two videos. In one, an actor playing a patient with advanced cancer was told by a doctor that treatment options had been exhausted. The other video showed the same scenario with a similar-looking doctor saying there may be some treatment options. . On a scale of 0 to 50, with 50 being the least compassionate, patients gave the doctor with good news a score of 19, compared to 26 for the doctor with bad news. . Fifty-seven patients said they preferred the doctor delivering the more optimistic message, while 22 preferred the doctor delivering the less optimistic news. . “The patients consistently perceived the doctor who gave the more optimistic message as more compassionate,” Bruera said. . He said the findings may help explain why doctors intuitively have a difficult time delivering bad news to their patients. . “It’s unfortunate, but it’s the reality of life that when the doctor needs to give the patient bad news, the perception of that patient may be that of a less compassionate doctor,” Bruera said. . There needs to be additional research into the findings, Dr. Teresa Gilewski of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said in an editorial accompanying the new study in JAMA Oncology, online February 26. . “For example, would the patient perception be different with an in-person interaction, a longer discussion, a personal relationship with the physician, or at a different time in the patient’s illness?” wrote Gilewski. . The researchers say future research should account for the trust patients have with their doctors, too. . Still, they also suggest researchers should craft techniques to help doctors deliver bad news without the content affecting the patients’ perceptions of their compassion. . SOURCE: .  and .  .

Shereen Lehman|After treatment for localized prostate cancer, changes in quality of life will vary by age, as will men’s reactions to those changes, according to a new study. . “While older and younger men start with different baseline quality of life function, older men may be less bothered by certain declines that may affect younger patients more,” Dr. Lindsay Hampson told Reuters Health in an email. . Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men of all ages in the U.S. Almost 60 percent of new cases are diagnosed in men over the age of 65, and the average age is 66. . Older men are often diagnosed with more aggressive disease and are less likely to get treatment, in part because they worry about the impact on their sexual and urinary function, Hampson and her colleagues write in European Urology. . Determining quality of life priorities is vital to ensuring that patients make well-informed treatment decisions, said Hampson, a urologist at the University of California San Francisco.  . The researchers reviewed national data on 5,362 men diagnosed between 1999 and 2013 with aggressive prostate cancer that had not spread. The men received various treatments, including surgery, brachytherapy, external beam radiation, or androgen deprivation, or active surveillance.  . Before treatment, and again within two years later, the men filled out surveys that included quality of life questions about their urological functioning and symptoms. . Overall, men over 70 had worse quality of life after treatment than those under 60 – except in terms of mental health - but the younger men were more bothered by quality of life declines. . For sexual function, 40 percent of the younger men reported a decline after treatment, compared to 46 percent of the older men. But 39 percent of younger men reported worsening sexual “bother” versus just 17 percent of the older men. . More men under 60 had declines in urinary function, with 14 percent reporting some negative change, compared to 9 percent of older men. . It’s likely that older men start out with a lower level of function, and lower expectations, and therefore are less bothered by declines, the study team writes. Or, perhaps older men have just learned to cope better with fluctuations in their functioning, they note. . Hampson said quality of life is a very important consideration when contemplating treatment for prostate cancer, and physicians can help patients make appropriate decisions.  . “The first critical question is whether the cancer needs treatment because many prostate cancers can be safely followed with active surveillance,” she said. . “Treatment should not be deferred for older men just because of quality of life concerns, just as younger men also need to be counseled about potential changes in quality of life after treatment,” Hampson said.  . Sexual and urinary problems are the most common problems after prostate cancer treatment, said Katrina Balter, a researcher at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, who was not involved in the study. . “It is important to discuss potential side effects associated with different treatment options,” Balter said. “If a man is sexually active, he might prioritize treatments with less risk of side effects or go for ‘watchful waiting’ (i.e. no treatment) whereas others may prioritize local treatment and potentially improved survival,” she told Reuters Health by email. .

Dan Whitcomb|(Reuters) - Three new cases of measles have been confirmed in Las Vegas, in people believed infected by a contagious worker at an upscale MGM Grand Hotel and Casino seafood restaurant, Nevada public health officials said on Friday. . The newly diagnosed patients, two staff members and a patron of Emeril’s New Orleans Fish House at the MGM Grand, bring to nine the total number of measles cases reported in Clark County, Southern Nevada Health District spokeswoman Jennifer Sizemore said. . None of those cases are believed linked to an outbreak of measles that began at Disneyland in December, she said.  . All told, more than 150 people across the United Sates have recently been diagnosed with measles, 126 of them in California.  . Nevada public health officials believe the Emeril’s worker was infected by an infant who was too young to have been immunized against the highly contagious disease. . Sizemore said none of the newly diagnosed patients was hospitalized, but one visited a Walgreens drug store and Chili’s restaurant in Las Vegas while infectious. . “The Health District is advising anyone who was at these locations during these times to review their immunization status against measles if they have not already had the disease,” Nevada health officials said in a prepared statement.  . “In addition, they should contact their health care provider if they develop rash with fever or other symptoms consistent with measles within 21 days after their visit,” the statement said. . Authorities believe the Disneyland outbreak began when a contagious person from out of the country visited the Anaheim theme park in late December. . California health officials say the source may never be identified, despite a finding that the same strain of virus had led to a wave of illness in the Philippines. . The outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccinations, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse them for their children. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after years of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within several weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Fri Feb 27 19:56:58 +0000 2015||Three infected with measles at Las Vegas seafood restaurant |5.713986070830858e+17|http://reut.rs/1C5m0ii
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - A team of scientists said on Friday they had found “robust evidence” that a condition called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a biological as opposed to a psychological disorder, but some experts questioned the findings. . The team from Columbia University in the United States identified in their research distinct immune changes in patients with CFS — markers they said pointed to distinct disease stages and would lead to better diagnosis and treatment. . CFS, sometimes called myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME, is a controversial and debilitating condition characterized by disabling physical and mental fatigue, poor concentration and memory, disturbed sleep and muscle and joint pain. . There is no cure and scientists don’t know what causes it, but it affects around 17 million people worldwide. . Many sufferers say they think their illness started after a viral infection. But suggested links to a virus known as XMRV were shown in a scientific paper in 2010 to have been based on contaminated samples in a lab. . Recent research showing psychological treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy can help CFS sufferers become more active have also caused argument, with some patients complaining such results suggest they are just lazy or suffering from a condition that is all in the mind. . In the latest study, published in the Science Advances journal, researchers found that specific immune patterns in patients who had CFS for three years or less were not present in controls or in patients who had the disease for more than three years.  . Short duration patients had higher amounts of many different types of immune molecules called cytokines, researchers found. The link was unusually strong with a cytokine called interferon gamma that has been linked to fatigue after viral infections.    . “We now have evidence confirming what millions of people with this disease already know — that ME/CFS isn’t psychological,” said Mady Hornig, who co-led the study. . The results should help speed diagnosis and the discovery of new treatments, she said. . However, other CFS specialists urged caution. . Michael Sharpe, a professor of psychological medicine, at Britain’s Oxford University said the finding was “potentially interesting” but added: “This type of study (a case-control study) is notorious for producing findings that other researchers subsequently fail to replicate.” . In a similar tone, Stephen Lawrie, an Edinburgh University psychiatry expert, said Hornig’s team may well have found different immune profiles at different stages of the disease, but added this could be “down to chance and hence a false positive signal”. |Fri Feb 27 19:23:08 +0000 2015||Study on biology of chronic fatigue illness stirs debate |5.7139009265012736e+17|http://reut.rs/1C5ctYx
|CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. and Liberian researchers have started a clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc’s Ebola drug ZMapp, an experimental treatment that has already been tried in a handful of Ebola patients, including two U.S. missionaries. . The trial, a joint effort by the Liberian government and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), will be conducted in Liberia and the United States among adults and children infected with Ebola, NIAID said on Friday. . Although ZMapp has been used on a humanitarian basis in nine infected patients, there was no way to tell whether the treatment offered a statistically significant benefit, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, said in a statement.  . Fauci said the randomized trial should provide the scientific evidence needed to show whether ZMapp is safe and effective, and whether it can be used in the current outbreak in West Africa and in future outbreaks. . The trial will enroll adults and children admitted to Ebola treatment units in Liberia, health care workers infected with Ebola virus in West Africa who have returned to the United States for treatment, and adults and children who may have acquired Ebola in the United States through secondary transmission. . Everyone in the study will receive the highest standard of care for treating Ebola. In addition, a portion of participants will also receive three doses of ZMapp. People in the study will be followed for up to a month after discharge. . The U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is funding the production of ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies made in tobacco plants. . If ZMapp proves effective, it will become part of the standard of care and a new treatment will be randomly assigned to portion of the patients.  . Other drugs to be tested include a treatment from Canadian drugmaker Tekmira, the antiviral Favipiravir from Japan’s Toyama Chemical Co, blood plasma collected from Ebola survivors, the drug BCX4430 from North Carolina-based BioCryst, and a treatment called AVI-7537 from Sarepta of Massachusetts. Each drug will be tested in up to 100 people per arm. . The trial is expected to conclude in December 2016, although scientists say they may need to be flexible as the Ebola epidemic wanes. . Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone reported 99 new confirmed Ebola cases in the week to Feb. 22, down from 128 the previous week, the WHO said on Wednesday. |Fri Feb 27 18:09:09 +0000 2015||U.S., Liberia kick off trial of Ebola drug ZMapp |5.713714738410742e+17|http://reut.rs/1DiaoDR
Ludwig Burger|LEVERKUSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Werner Baumann, seen as heir apparent to Bayer Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers, says he will fight for the independence of Germany’s largest drugmaker after the spin-off of its plastics unit. . “We will always try anew every day to defend our independence through our performance and the decisions that we make,” said the 52-year-old, who will head Bayer’s main healthcare arm from April. . In an interview with Reuters, Baumann said Bayer did not need a merger to make it more successful, even if there were few synergies between the healthcare, veterinary drugs and crop protection businesses. . He said the group was getting “good initial results” from early-stage research across its life science units, which costs a double-digit million euro amount per year, but added that this was not the reason for keeping the businesses under one roof.  . “We never said we wanted to become a life science company,” he said. “Our portfolio is rather the result of a) what we are good at and b) what we regard as attractive markets in terms of long-term growth, profitability and barriers to market entry.” . Baumann said what will remain of the conglomerate after the planned split-off of its plastics unit is a result of what he and his fellow executives are best at managing and not held together by synergies — the potential for which is often cited as a driver behind mergers and acquisitions. . “Synergies per se are no raison d’etre for organizational structures and businesses,” he said. . Bayer, which invented Aspirin and polyurethane foams, unveiled plans in September to list its plastics business on the stock market to focus on its more profitable life-science businesses around human, animal and plant health.   . CEO Dekkers has stressed the research synergies to be gained between the various life sciences. . He will step down at the end of 2016 and has said it will be up to the supervisory board to pick a successor, but Baumann is widely seen as the front-runner. . Baumann, a former group finance chief who is also responsible for group strategy, has spent his entire career at Bayer, having played key roles in folding Roche’s consumer health unit and rival drugmaker Schering into Bayer. . Baumann dismissed the premium put on pure-play stocks by most equity fund managers, who find it harder to build an industry mix from conglomerates in their portfolios. . “That’s the difference between companies and shareholders... We have about 120,000 staff, soon about 100,000, with some families having worked for the company in the sixth or seventh generation.” . “Our responsibility in society goes far, far beyond our shareholders,” said the father of four. . Major healthcare players are in the midst of a series of asset sales and swaps to better focus on the types of medicines that will bring them the most growth, exemplified by a complex $20 billion transaction between GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. . Pfizer has in recent years severed its animal health business, now known as Zoetis, and is seen as possibly splitting off its patent-free established products arm. . Bayer’s relative conservatism is in contrast to such radical ideas, but despite this the stock has been a boon to investors. . It has yielded a total return of about 90 percent over the last two years, compared with the 56 percent performance of the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index, driven by the launch of new drugs, the purchase of Merck & Co’s consumer health business and its plans to split off plastics. |Fri Feb 27 17:33:07 +0000 2015||Bayer crown prince vows independence for diversified drugmaker |5.7136240383902106e+17|http://reut.rs/1Di1EO0
Guillermo Parra-Bernal|SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian hospitals and health clinics are drawing strong interest from global buyout firms after the government recently decided to allow foreign ownership of those facilities, although the suitors may find only a few promising targets. . Private equity tops a list of potential investors in a sector that represents 10 percent of Brazil’s gross domestic product and shows promise of growth but is hobbled by aging infrastructure, a dearth of qualified staff and rising costs. Since 2007, the number of hospital beds fell by 9 percent while the base of insurance policyholders rose 35 percent, according to government data. . The hunt for assets is already under way, but some funds want to understand the particulars of the market before making a move, said four people familiar with their plans.  . Two of those sources said a proposal by Carlyle Group LP (. ) to pay as much as 2 billion reais ($694 million) for a 30 percent stake in Rede D’Or São Luiz SA, Brazil’s largest hospital chain, is the only deal in an advanced stage. Carlyle and Rede D’Or, controlled by founder Jorge Moll and Grupo BTG Pactual SA’s BBTG11.SABPPA.AS merchant banking unit, declined to comment. . Other funds such as Advent International Corp and KKR & Co LP (. ) are “walking on eggshells” as evidence of poor governance, high debt and eroding margins in some clinics and hospitals abound, one of the sources said. Beyond Rede D’Or, “only a handful” of hospital chains seem well-equipped to receive a significant influx of resources, the same source added. . President Dilma Rousseff’s decision last month to end the ban on foreign ownership in the sector seeks to lure capital into Brazil’s 6,800 private hospitals. Until now, foreigners could only gain exposure to the sector by buying health insurers the way UnitedHealth Group Inc (. ) did in 2012, when it paid $4.9 billion for Amil Participações SA. . Ending the ban “was a milestone, but it’s hard to see anything gaining traction in the short run,” said Francisco Balestrin, president of Anahp, a group representing private hospitals. “Any new investors want to first understand the existing market asymmetries.” . Curitiba-based Grupo VITA, Belo Horizonte-based Hospital Mater Dei, Recife-based Hospital Santa Joana and São Paulo-based maternity hospital Pro Matre Paulista have sparked some interest among potential investors, the sources said. . Yet the industry’s crown jewels, non-profit hospitals owned by communities and philanthropic foundations, are not for sale. The most prominent, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, is controlled by Brazil’s Jewish community and runs its own endowment. . “I don’t see non-profit hospitals morphing into for-profit firms,” Bradesco BBI analyst Rafael Frade said. . Einstein and peer Hospital Sírio Libanês would fit well into buyout funds’ strategy of acquiring companies whose high degree of specialization allows them to charge more for services. . Mater Dei and VITA denied being involved in merger or acquisition talks. KKR, Advent and the other hospitals declined to comment. . Private equity involvement in Brazil’s hospital industry could help restore profitability, Bradesco BBI’s Frade said. Returns have stayed near record lows for the past two years due to accelerating inflation and strained capacity, data from industry watchdog ANS shows. . Hospitals look attractive because they stand to benefit from a growing number of elderly Brazilians in coming years. A 20 percent slump in Brazil’s currency over the past year has also made acquisitions cheaper, said Ricardo Gaillard, a partner at law firm Souza Cescon Barrieu & Flesch Advogados. . The rapid expansion in health plan membership in the last decade was not accompanied by an equivalent improvement in infrastructure, triggering a supply-and-demand mismatch that buyout firms may want to close in coming years, he added.  . To ease the supply crunch, an additional 13,000 hospital beds are needed by 2017, Anahp’s Balestrin said. Some funding for that increase, which could cost 7 billion reais, could come from private equity money, he added. . In addition, rising costs from the lack of scale are pushing up medical inflation. Average revenue per patient per day rose almost 2 percent last year, Anahp estimates, well below overall inflation of 6.5 percent. |Fri Feb 27 17:33:06 +0000 2015||Private equity 'walks on eggshells' as funds eye Brazil hospitals |5.713624018006262e+17|http://reut.rs/1E4r5YP
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - Excess pounds and smoking might each raise the likelihood of frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), according to a large study from Norway. . Other factors linked to higher odds of new GERD symptoms included getting older, being a woman, having less education, and even quitting smoking – if it led to weight gain. . “Heartburn and acid regurgitation are very frequent, up to 30 percent of people in Western populations have these complaints at least weekly, so we wanted to know more about the reasons why these symptoms appear,” said Dr. Eivind Ness-Jensen, the study’s senior author.  . GERD is defined as having “troublesome” symptoms of acid reflux - where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus - or complications of reflux at least once a week, the study team writes in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. . Other symptoms include hoarseness, laryngitis, dry cough and increased saliva. GERD can also eventually lead to precancerous changes in the esophagus. . To see what characteristics predict development of GERD, the researchers analyzed data on nearly 30,000 people in Nord-Trondelag County, Norway.  . Subjects were interviewed in 1995-1997 and again in 2006-2009.  . They had no GERD symptoms in the first interview. By the second interview, 510 people had severe GERD symptoms and 14,406  still had no GERD complaints. People with very mild or less than weekly symptoms were excluded from the comparison. . The researchers found a steady increase in GERD risk with greater excess weight, based on body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI of less than 25 is considered normal, 26 to 29.9 is overweight or “pre-obese” and 30 or above is obese. . In the 12-year study, the risk of developing GERD rose by 30 percent with every one-point increase in BMI, regardless of the person’s starting BMI. . People who smoked cigarettes or had smoked previously were 29 to 37 percent more likely to develop GERD than never-smokers.  . And those who stopped smoking but whose BMI rose more than 3.5 points after quitting were twice as likely to develop symptoms as people who had never smoked.   . Ness-Jensen, a public health researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Levanger, noted in an email that one of his previous studies showed quitting smoking reduced the risk of GERD symptoms, although the current study found that weight gain could take away that protection. “So, avoid weight gain when quitting smoking,” he said. . “Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, increases the pressure on the diaphragm and the muscles separating the esophagus from the stomach, pushing acidic stomach content into the esophagus. Tobacco smoking relaxes the muscles, facilitating reflux, and reduces the production of saliva, which helps clean the esophagus,” he explained. . Men were about 20 percent less likely to have GERD symptoms than women. In addition, people with a higher education were about 30 percent less likely to develop GERD than people with less education. Simply getting older also increased the risk of symptoms by 1 percent per year.   . Dr. Ronnie Fass, chair of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, said two of the study’s unique findings were that men had a lower chance of getting GERD and that smoking could lead to symptoms.   . “It has been established in the literature that males and females have the same risk of having GERD . . .  As a result, this is very intriguing,” said Fass, who was not involved in the study. . While past studies have linked smoking with GERD, this “is one of the first studies that in fact documented the role of smoking in causing new onset GERD-related symptoms,” said Fass. . Fass said helpful web sites for people who want more information on possible risk factors and symptoms of GERD are: .  and .  . SOURCE: .

|ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche said on Friday that European regulators had recommended approval of its drug Avastin in combination with chemotherapy as a treatment for women with an advanced form of cancer of the cervix. . Avastin, which is already approved in Europe to treat advanced stages of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer and ovarian cancer, was the Basel-based drugmaker’s biggest seller last year with sales of 6.42 billion Swiss francs ($6.76 billion). |Fri Feb 27 17:12:44 +0000 2015||Roche says EU agency recommends Avastin for cervical cancer |5.7135727370612736e+17|http://reut.rs/1DhXhCF
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - In an early study, inhaling the hormone oxytocin appeared to encourage men with autism to make more eye contact. . But this was a small experiment with several limitations and does not mean oxytocin should immediately become a therapy for autism, experts cautioned. . Oxytocin has been touted as the “love hormone” and the “moral molecule” in the past. Naturally released during intercourse and breastfeeding, it seems to at least make people more social, if not actually more loving. . For the new study, researchers from the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge in the UK and other European institutions compared 32 men with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Asperger Syndrome and another 34 men without those disorders but of similar age and IQ. . Individually, the men video-chatted with a female researcher twice. Before one interview, participants inhaled oxytocin. Before the other, they inhaled a placebo spray. . The video-chat software included eye tracking, which recorded how often the subject focused on the eyes, mouth or other face areas during the interviews. . The female interviewer asked the men how they were doing, how the nasal spray made them feel, how they liked or didn’t like being in the study and similar questions for about five minutes. . With placebo, men with autism focused on the interviewer’s eyes less often and for less time than men without autism. . With oxytocin, the number of times men with autism looked at the interviewer’s eyes rose from an average of 0.59 per second to more than 0.7 per second. For men without autism, glances at the eyes rose from 0.83 to almost 0.9 per second, the authors reported in Translational Psychiatry.  . Dr. Lawrence Scahill, director of clinical trials at the Marcus Autism Center at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved in the new research, told Reuters Health by email, “This is a step forward, but we should be careful not to over-interpret the results. As noted by the authors, findings with (oxytocin) in ASD have been inconsistent.” . Video interviews are not natural interaction, he noted, and the study participants with autism were “high functioning,” having been medication-free for at least a year. . The findings do add to mounting evidence that oxytocin enhances attention to the eyes, said Tobias Grossman, a developmental psychologist specializing in the brain processes underpinning social interaction at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. . “However, it is unclear whether increased looking to the eyes actually improves social functioning,” Grossman, who was also not involved in the new study, told Reuters Health.  . Prior work with children with autism shows that oxytocin increases brain function in regions involved in social processing but doesn’t affect performance of other tasks, he said. . In other words, oxytocin may increase glances at eyes, and also brain response to eyes, but without affecting behavior when responding to eye cues, Grossman said. . Reduced eye contact is one of the earliest warning signs in young children with autism and might be evident as soon as two to six months of age, he said. Much of what happens for these infants developmentally, and how much oxytocin may be involved, remains unknown. . Grossman and Scahill agree that the new findings are not evidence that oxytocin should be used as a therapy for children with autism. . SOURCE: .

|ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis said on Friday its treatment for a leading cause of age-related blindness had met its primary goals in a study and could potentially pave the way for less frequent dosing compared to a drug already on the market. . Developed by Novartis’s eyecare unit Alcon, the RTH258 drug is intended to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which causes severe loss of vision in the over 50s and occurs when the center of the retina, or macula, deteriorates. . Novartis said RTH258 demonstrated promising improvements in vision in the Phase II study that were as good as the popular treatment Eylea, produced by drugmakers Regeneron in the United States and Bayer elsewhere. . Patients treated every three months with RTH258 experienced prolonged effects of the treatment, which could potentially reduce the treatment burden, Novartis said, adding Alcon had started a late-stage Phase III trial of the drug. . Novartis already sells an older drug for AMD called Lucentis. |Fri Feb 27 16:57:12 +0000 2015||Novartis treatment for vision loss meets goals in study |5.71353368314155e+17|http://reut.rs/1E4jz07
Kate|LONDON, Feb 27 - The world remains highly vulnerable to a possible severe flu pandemic and governments should increase surveillance, vigilance and preparedness, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday. . “Nothing about influenza is predictable - including where the next pandemic might emerge and which virus might be responsible,” the United Nations health agency warned. . It said the world was fortunate that the last flu pandemic, caused by H1N1 swine flu in 2009/2010, was relatively mild, but added: “Such good fortune is no precedent”. . In a seven-page report on flu, WHO said that on many levels, the world is better prepared now than ever before for a flu pandemic. The level of alert is high, it said, and there is better surveillance of flu viruses in both animals and humans. . In 2014, the WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, made up of 142 laboratories in 112 countries,  tested more than 1.9 million clinical specimens. . “By keeping a close watch over the volatile world of influenza viruses, these laboratories operate as a sensitive early warning system.” . Under the heading “Warning: Be prepared for surprises”, WHO praised progress in virological research that had increased capability to detect, understand and assess new viruses for pandemic risk, and to track their international spread.  . But it said this needed to be stepped up. . “More (research and development) is needed to develop better vaccines and shorten the production time,” it said, adding that during a severe pandemic, many people would die in the three to four months currently needed to make effective vaccines. . “An influenza pandemic is the most global of infectious disease events currently known. It is in every country’s best interests to prepare.” . Andrew Easton, a Warwick University professor of virology, echoed the WHO’s concerns: “It is not possible to predict with certainty which animal influenza strain will cause the next pandemic, though we can be certain that one will,” he said. . This year’s seasonal flu season has been bad in many parts of the world, with Asia, the Americas and Europe reporting high levels of circulating flu viruses and low levels of protection from vaccines that did not match the relevant strains. . WHO also noted the sudden increase in human cases of H5N1 bird flu in Egypt, which it said had “awakened concern”. . WHO data show Egypt reporting 108 cases of H5N1 in people from start of November 2014 to 23 February, including 35 deaths. |Fri Feb 27 14:37:15 +0000 2015||Watch out for nasty global flu surprises, WHO warns |5.71318146881196e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dho9T2
Misha Hussain|DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The West African Ebola outbreak has halted progress in tackling HIV in Sierra Leone, shutting health clinics and scaring patients from being tested or seeking treatment, the United Nations has said. . In an internal document seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) raised concerns that HIV prevalence and drug resistance in the country could increase as a result. . The worst recorded outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 9,500 people, infected over 23,500 others and placed immense pressure on already weak health systems in hardest-hit Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. . “Hospitals have closed down because they have been overrun by Ebola patients and non-Ebola patients are too afraid to go to them for fear of catching the virus,” said Hakan Bjorkman, who manages UNDP’s AIDS program. . “HIV prevention activities in schools and awareness raising for the general population has been suspended due to the restriction of movement, the closure of all education institutions and the overall ban on public gathering.” . Some 25 percent of patients taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the virus that causes AIDS are missing clinic appointments in and around Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown, where the main Ebola affected communities are, Bjorkman said. . There has also been a decline of at least 70 percent in HIV testing and counseling services and logistical issues mean that essential HIV drugs are either expiring or quickly becoming out of stock, according to the UNDP document that was released internally in December. . “If this is not dealt with quickly, we risk the virus spreading to more people, more people dying of opportunistic disease like tuberculosis and the virus building up a resistance to our drugs,” Bjorkman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone from Geneva. . Some 58,000 people are living with HIV in Sierra Leone, a country of around 6 million people. About a third of those affected need life-saving ART, however, as of June 2014, only 10,673 people were receiving ART, the report said. . Bjorkman said the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria had provided some $55 million to deal with AIDS in Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2015, but only around $25 million had been spent to date, partly due to the Ebola response.   . “We need to kick-start counseling and testing on high risk groups, follow up on patients who have defaulted on their treatment, and restart campaigns in schools and public places now the bans have been lifted,” he said. . However, there may be one positive impact of the Ebola outbreak on HIV infection rates in West Africa.  . “People are scared of having sex in this time of Ebola, which could have an impact in reducing HIV infection too,” said Bjorkman, noting that the Ebola response needs to drum home use of condoms and not just washing hands.   |Fri Feb 27 14:10:18 +0000 2015||Ebola halts HIV progress in Sierra Leone, says U.N. |5.713113632194437e+17|http://reut.rs/1DhiAnK
Samantha Kareen Nair|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a hormonal contraceptive device on Friday that gives American women another reversible contraceptive choice as effective as sterilization. . The intrauterine device (IUD) device, Liletta, releases the hormone levonorgestrel to inhibit thickening of the womb lining, preventing pregnancy for up to three years. . Typically smaller than an iPod Shuffle, the IUD is a t-shaped piece of plastic that must be inserted into the uterus to prevent fertilization. . Dublin-based Actavis Plc holds the commercial license for the product, but the marketing application was submitted by non-profit pharmaceutical company Medicines360, which holds the U.S. public sector clinic rights. . The companies expect the device, which also helps to check heavy menstrual bleeding, to be available in the United States by the second quarter of 2015. It is already in use in Europe. . Hormonal IUDs are marginally more effective than commonly used copper IUDs such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industry Ltd’s Paragard, which last longer but provide no control of blood flow. . Liletta will compete in the $1 billion global market for IUDs. Michael WaterHouse, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar, said he expected peak global sales of below $500 million. . The device will also compete with Bayer AG’s hormonal IUDs Mirena and Skyla in the United States. . While existing devices offer between three and 12 years of protection, Liletta is approved for use for up to three years. . The longer duration of protection is not imperative for women as most use an IUD for less than three years, Pamela Weir, Medicines360’s Chief Operating officer, told Reuters. . Liletta is being tested in the largest-ever U.S. trial for IUDs, with a diverse patient population encompassing a range of weights, ages and races. It also includes women who have given birth as well as those who have not. . The trial is evaluating Liletta’s use for up to seven years.      . Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) have returned to popularity over the past decade as more potent devices hit the market. . LARCs, including IUDs and implants, are more effective than other contraceptives such as pills and patches and are nearly as effective as sterilization, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Approval of Liletta was widely expected. . Actavis shares rose 0.8 percent to $292.01 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. |Fri Feb 27 13:18:37 +0000 2015||Actavis' contraceptive device wins U.S. FDA approval |5.712983594929398e+17|http://reut.rs/1E3zviV
|LONDON (Reuters) - European health regulators said on Friday they had recommended approval of a drug for advanced lung cancer developed by Swiss drugmaker Novartis that is intended to treat patients with a specific genetic mutation. . Zykadia, or ceritinib, is from a new class medicines known as ALK inhibitors. It was approved in April 2014 in the United States. . It is designed for use in non-small cell lung cancer patients who have previously been treated with Pfizer’s Xalkori, another ALK inhibitor. . Between 2 and 7 percent of non-small cell lung cancer patients have the specific mutation of the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) protein for which such treatment is targeted. They are often non smokers. |Fri Feb 27 13:02:47 +0000 2015||Novartis lung cancer drug gets EU recommendation |5.712943747573432e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dh74Ja
|GENEVA (Reuters) - Sports fans risk having their hearing ruined by vuvuzela trumpets and deliberate attempts to increase stadium noise and they need to start seeing earplugs as something cool, the World Health Organization said on Friday.  . Shelly Chadha, a WHO expert on preventing deafness, said some U.S. sporting crowds consider breaking noise levels as an achievement, and cited a 136.6 decibel world record claimed by Seattle Seahawks fans in 2013.   . “Anybody who is exposed to 136 dB for even a minute is going to face some consequences,” she told a news conference. . Vuvuzelas, the blaring plastic trumpets that became the icon of 2010 soccer World Cup in South Africa, can have a sound intensity level of 120 dB - unsafe for more than 9 seconds a day. . Asked if they should be banned, Chadha said: “Yes, well, vuvuzelas are certainly something we can live without.” . Around 1.1 billion young people are at risk from hearing loss, the WHO said, in addition to about 180 million who have already suffered preventable damage to their hearing.  . As well as sporting events, there are risks to hearing at nightclubs and from listening to smartphones, and the solutions include volume limits, noise-cancelling headphones and earplugs, which can reduce noise levels by 30 decibels, turning the roar of a fighter jet into little more than a hair dryer. . The damage is irreversible, although there may be some hope from research into stem cells and into some fish that can regenerate hearing cells, Chadha said. . “At the point when you can’t understand conversation around you, you know that this is too loud,” said Chadha. |Fri Feb 27 12:46:58 +0000 2015||Going to the game?

Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi’s new Toujeo diabetes drug has been recommended for approval in Europe, two days after being cleared for sale in the United States, regulators said on Friday. . The positive decision from experts at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had been expected and paves the way for the long-lasting insulin product to be marketed soon in Sanofi’s chosen first European markets, Germany and Britain. . Recommendations for marketing approval by the agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. . Significantly, the EMA highlighted the benefits of Toujeo in reducing the risk of hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar levels, compared to Lantus. . “In Type 2 diabetes patients, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was lower with Toujeo, in particular at night, as compared to insulin glargine 100 U/ml (Lantus),” the agency said in a statement. . That endorsement contrasts with the medicine’s U.S. label, which disappointed many investors by failing to highlight lower rates of hypoglycemia. . However, the EMA also noted a 10-18 percent higher Toujeo dose may be needed to achieve target ranges for blood sugar levels. . Toujeo is a follow-up to Sanofi’s top-selling Lantus drug, which accounts for a fifth of the company’s sales. Sanofi hopes  to convert patients to Toujeo as Lantus faces loss of patient protection. . A key issue in determining its take-up will be the price Sanofi charges. . Sanofi has declined to detail the cost before Toujeo is launched, although it has stated that “pricing will not be a barrier to access”. . While some analysts have suggested Toujeo will need to be priced at a discount to Lantus to ensure strong take-up, Tim Anderson of Bernstein said industry contacts had indicated it  was likely to be priced at parity, although Sanofi could still offer rebates to bring the net cost down. . Toujeo has the same active ingredient as Lantus, insulin glargine, but at three times the concentration and with a design to release the insulin more gradually. . Lantus is the world’s most prescribed insulin with sales of 6.34 billion euros ($7.12 billion) in 2014. Warnings of faltering U.S. sales of Lantus contributed to the sudden sacking of Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher last year. . His successor, Olivier Brandicourt, is set to assume the top post at the beginning of April as Toujeo goes on sale. |Fri Feb 27 12:46:58 +0000 2015||Sanofi diabetes drug Toujeo wins European green light |5.712903922279096e+17|http://reut.rs/1E3tdA1

Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - An independent advisory body will decide in August at the earliest on whether to recommend widespread introduction of an Ebola vaccine, depending on results of clinical trials and the epidemic’s course, the World Health Organization said on Friday. . All three worst-hit countries in West Africa - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - aim to conduct phase III final-stage  clinical trials of experimental vaccines.  . Liberia is already testing both the GlaxoSmithKline and Merck-NewLink vaccines, while Sierra Leone and Guinea are due to announce plans soon. . Thousands of health care workers and others exposed to the deadly virus have volunteered to take part in the trials, but the question of mass vaccination of wider populations is open. . WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier, reporting on a three-day meeting of experts, told a news briefing: “Vaccine introduction is by no means a given and will depend on the results of clinical trials and recommendations from WHO’s Strategy Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on vaccines and immunization.  . “The earliest that the SAGE is expected to make recommendation on a wide-scale introduction is August. Decisions on whether or not to introduce the vaccine will be made by the respective ministries of health of countries.”  . There are “many unknowns”, Lindmeier said. “It will depend on outcomes of clinical trials, evolution of the epidemic etc.” . A steep fall in Ebola cases recorded in Liberia will make it hard to prove whether experimental vaccines work in a major clinical trial, meaning some testing may have to be moved to Sierra Leone, the head of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) said in late January. . WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said: “We know the vaccines are safe, we know they produce a good immunogenic response in humans, but we don’t know if they are effective when you actually have disease in community.”  . Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone reported 99 new confirmed Ebola cases in the week to Feb. 22, down from 128 the previous week, the WHO said on Wednesday. . In all, more than 23,500 cases have been reported in the three West African countries, with more than 9,500 deaths, since the world’s worst outbreak of Ebola began in December 2013. |Fri Feb 27 10:59:00 +0000 2015||Decision on widespread Ebola vaccination in August at earliest: WHO |5.7126322285201e+17|http://reut.rs/1E395Op
Sara Ledwith|LONDON (Reuters) - Electronic cigarette firms in Italy say a new levy that doubles the price of e-liquid refills unfairly helps tobacco giants like Philip Morris International and will hurt their industry. . The tax, which was adopted in January, is set at half the rate of that on traditional cigarettes. The controversy centers on the fact that the lower rate is applied to both electronic cigarettes and to tobacco products such as Marlboro HeatSticks, which Philip Morris is launching in Italy alongside a 500 million euro ($568 million) factory investment. . E-cigarette companies say applying the discount to tobacco products is unfair, and designed to help Big Tobacco. The firms and industry experts also say the method of calculating the tax is too complicated and gives an unfair discount to Philip Morris’ products. . “It’s unjust,” said Massimiliano Mancini, president of ANAFE-Confindustria, a national trade association of e-cig and e-liquids producers. “It’s clear that this legislation has been drafted for other interests than just taxing the e-cigs.” He declined to elaborate. . Philip Morris would not comment on whether the new law gave it an advantage. “We have shared our views with the government via public hearings just like our competitors and others,” a spokesman told Reuters by email. . It pledged last year to make HeatSticks and other “reduced risk” products in a new factory in Bologna. Shortly before the plant’s inauguration, the firm’s CEO in Italy, Eugenio Sidoli, told the Senate Finance Committee that he welcomed the new tax rules, saying they would create “a certain and stable” regulatory outlook for the kind of investment his company was making. . Italy is one of the first countries to tax e-cigarettes; the European Union is considering the idea. The devices do not use tobacco, which contains hundreds of toxins, but instead heat liquids laced with nicotine. Many scientists agree the products are probably safer than conventional cigarettes. . Other new devices such as Marlboro HeatSticks do use tobacco and have not yet been tested to the same degree. Unless studies prove they are as safe as e-cigarettes, e-cig firms say, they should not be taxed at the lower rate. . In all, Italy collects around 12 billion euros a year in tobacco taxes. Philip Morris’ products account for 7.5 billion euros of that, according to the testimony Sidoli gave the Senate committee last October. . But Italy’s tobacco tax take has declined by more than 500 million euros since 2013. The government has said that’s partly due to the rise in e-cigarette sales. It began to think about taxing the devices in 2013 and initially introduced a tax that  more than tripled e-liquid prices, and also applied to batteries and chargers sold with e-cigarettes. . That tax was blocked by Italian courts as too confusing, forcing Rome to rethink its plans. But e-cigarette distributors and some big tobacco companies object to the latest scheme, too. . The drawn-out controversy has hurt the industry in Italy, e-cig backers say. While e-cigarette use has been growing globally, the number of regular “vapers” in Italy has slumped to 255,000 from almost half a million in 2013, health ministry figures show. Thousands of e-cigarette shops have closed.  . Italy’s Economy Ministry declined to comment. . Italy’s new law assumes that e-cigarettes are safer and should be taxed at a lower rate than traditional cigarettes. The e-cigarette lobby welcomes this but objects to extending that discount to other new products, such as the tobacco-based systems sold in Italy by Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which heat tobacco in pen-like devices. The Philip Morris system uses tobacco sticks that look like mini cigarettes while JTI’s system, called Ploom, uses aluminum pods filled with tobacco. . Philip Morris says HeatSticks, which it is also testing in Japan, are potentially less harmful than traditional cigarettes “because they are not intended to be lit on fire and smoked, but rather heated and vaped.” . But neither it nor JTI include health claims in their marketing for heat-not-burn products. Philip Morris expects to have more scientific evidence during the first half of this year, its CEO told analysts earlier this month. . Even so, Italian lawmakers said in the tax decree that a tax discount on such products was justified by the “absence of combustion” which gives them “minor toxicity” compared with traditional cigarettes. . Valerio Forconi, Corporate Affairs and Legal Director in the Italian branch of tobacco giant Imperial Tobacco, says the principle of the tax is wrong. . Imperial, whose subsidiary Fontem Ventures plans to launch a new e-cig model in Rome in March, does not object to the tax charge, he said, but believes it is too high compared to tobacco products. Philip Morris’ HeatSticks can be lit and smoked, according to Forconi. This makes Italy perhaps “the only country in the world” that effectively gives Philip Morris a tax discount on smoking. . Philip Morris said HeatSticks should not be lit and smoked. “If burned,” the spokesman said, “the experience would not be pleasurable.” |Fri Feb 27 10:59:00 +0000 2015||Italian e-cigarette firms say new tax benefits tobacco |5.7126322097297e+17|http://reut.rs/1DgQaKH
|(Reuters) - Preliminary results from the largest U.S. survey of tobacco consumption show a high number of people use multiple products, adding key data to the debate on the role of e-cigarettes in reducing harm from tobacco. . The results of the study, released Thursday, showed 40 percent of tobacco consumers use multiple products, such as cigarillos, hookah and cigars. Half of all combinations involved e-cigarettes. . The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study of 46,000 people, begun in 2011, is designed to answer questions about the tobacco use and behavior and help shape industry regulation. . Public health officials have long questioned whether smokers attracted to e-cigarettes will use them to quit smoking or simply as an alternative for use in places where smoking is not allowed.   . Data released on Thursday did not give definitive insight about why people are using different forms of tobacco. Andrew Hyland, scientific principal investigator on the study and chair of the department of health behavior at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, said they may be transitioning away from cigarettes, or they may be becoming more entrenched.  . The study is expected to provide a wealth of information about tobacco use, smoking behavior and attitudes and will give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration data to reshape industry regulations. . “We were struck by the proportion of users that engaged in polyuse,” Mitch Zeller, head of the Food and Drug Administration’s tobacco division, said in an interview, referring to the use of multiple products.  . Preliminary results were presented to an audience of scientists, researchers and industry representatives at the annual meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco in Philadelphia. . The most common combination of products among youth and adults was cigarettes and e-cigarettes, data showed. . The results, to be gathered and disclosed over years, are expected to provide for tobacco the type of information that the decades-long Framingham Heart Study has provided about heart disease and its impact on public health. . Although the information about multi-product use is a start, more time will be needed to identify the reasons for such use, study organizers said. . “Is it a step towards people quitting, or are the hooks of nicotine just getting deeper,” said Hyland. . The tobacco industry is rapidly changing with the popularity of electronic nicotine devices. . “The evolution that has taken place in the marketplace makes your head spin,” Zeller said. |Fri Feb 27 05:07:34 +0000 2015||Data from largest U.S. tobacco study shows high use of multiple products |5.711747814516818e+17|http://reut.rs/1E2eRzX
Ian Simpson|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Possession of small amounts of marijuana became legal in the District of Columbia on Thursday, launching a pot “green rush” despite a face-off between local officials and the Republican-led U.S. Congress over the new standards. . The U.S. capital joined Washington state, Alaska and Colorado in making marijuana lawful for recreational use, reflecting a rapidly shifting legal landscape for the drug.    It remains illegal under federal law. . “Nationwide, it (legalization) is clearly symbolic in its ability to impact other places” in the United States, said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. . He called the new legal framework “depenalization” since sales were still barred, and said it was unlikely to unseat a thriving black market. City finance officials have estimated the marijuana market at $130 million a year. . Initiative 71, a ballot measure legalizing marijuana possession that was approved by 65 percent of District of Columbia voters in November, took effect at 12:01 a.m. . Oregon voters approved a similar measure in November, but marijuana does not become lawful there until July.  . The District of Columbia law allows adults to possess up to 2 ounces (56 grams) of marijuana and to grow six plants at home, three of them mature. Sales are barred but transfers of up to 1 ounce (26 grams) are legal. . Bongs, pipes and other paraphernalia are legal but public smoking is not. Marijuana is barred in about 20 percent of the city that is federal land. . Mayor Muriel Bowser and other city officials vowed on Wednesday that legalization would go ahead despite warnings from Republicans on the House of Representatives Oversight Committee that the move was illegal. . Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah contends a December spending bill had barred the District of Columbia from spending funds to make pot legal or lessen penalties. Congress has oversight over the District of Columbia. . Legalization has fueled what NORML’s St. Pierre called a “green rush” for entrepreneurs, users and growers eager to  explore the law’s limits and loopholes. . Michael Bayard, owner of Capital City Hydroponics, which sells indoor gardening equipment, said business had gone up about 50 percent since January as legalization neared. The store sells home marijuana kits for $420 to $1,200. . “We’re ready for the influx of people looking for exactly that kind of garden,” he said. . A marijuana expo sponsored by ComfyTree, a Michigan cannabis consultancy, and set for Saturday and Sunday has drawn dozens of exhibitors and hundreds of registered visitors. . The DC Cannabis Campaign, which spearheaded Initiative 71, plans to hold a seed exchange next month. The group’s leader, Adam Eidinger, whose paraphernalia shop was shut by police two years ago, is on course to re-open it. |Fri Feb 27 04:56:26 +0000 2015||Legal marijuana begins in Washington, D.C. as 'green rush' is on |5.7117197999215e+17|http://reut.rs/1DgacoC
|(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest health insurer in the United States, is placing tighter controls on its coverage of hysterectomies after a device called a morcellator was linked to the spread of undiagnosed cancer cells. . In an update to its reimbursement guidelines, UnitedHealth said that, starting April 6, it will require physicians to obtain authorization before carrying out certain types of hysterectomies, a procedure in which a woman’s uterus is removed for reasons ranging from fibroids or endometriosis to chronic pelvic pain. . UnitedHealth said it will not require prior authorization for vaginal hysterectomies, in which the uterus is removed through the vagina, when done on an outpatient basis. . In its update, the insurer cites the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as identifying vaginal hysterectomies as the preferred method. . The Food and Drug Administration issued an advisory nearly a year ago recommending that surgeons avoid the use of surgical morcellators in performing hysterectomies because of evidence  the technique could spread cancerous tissue. Morcellators are devices used in laparoscopic surgery to cut up tissue so that it can be removed through small incision sites. . The FDA said a vaginal hysterectomy usually yields comparable or better results with fewer complications than laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. |Fri Feb 27 00:28:16 +0000 2015||UnitedHealth places tighter controls on hysterectomies |5.7110449138427904e+17|http://reut.rs/1E1vpId
Ronnie Cohen|(Reuters Health) – - A growing number of American children are bending into downward dog and other yoga poses, according to a new report on complementary health practices. . The report analyzed National Health Interview Survey data on practices outside of mainstream medicine and found significantly more kids and teens practicing yoga, tai chi and qi gong in 2012 than in 2007.  . The study also showed a significant increase in the number of children using melatonin supplements as sleep aids. Melatonin is a natural hormone known to play a role in sleep. . Yoga originated in India more than 5,000 years ago, and the mind-body practice has become so popular in the west that yoga studios are as common in parts of California as Starbucks coffeehouses. . The new study, published in National Health Statistics Reports, included 17,321 interviews with adults about their 4- to 17-year-olds.  . Overall, 3.1 percent of kids did yoga in 2012, up from 2.3 percent in 2007.  . Industry data shows a nearly 8 percent increase in the number of yoga instructors during the same five years, the study authors write. In addition, they say, public schools are beginning to incorporate yoga – which fosters stretching, relaxing and developing strength – into fitness programs. . The increase in children’s use of yoga and melatonin was a surprise to Dr. Josephine Briggs, director of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). . “The changes in the yoga category are very large,” she told Reuters Health. “I was also struck by the use of melatonin in children.” . In 2007, an estimated 1.3 million children did yoga, tai chi or qi gong, senior author Richard Nahin said at a news conference. The number grew to 1.9 million children in 2012, he said.  . Researchers included the Chinese practices of tai chi and qi gong in the analysis because they are also mind-body practices, and their inclusion bolstered the sample sizes and the statistical power of the findings. . Girls were four times more likely to practice yoga, tai chi or qi gong in the prior year than boys, the study found.  . Use of melatonin increased 700 percent, from 0.1 percent to 0.7 percent of children, between 2007 and 2012, Nahin said. . Briggs said she knew of no safety issues regarding melatonin for children. Rising use of the supplements may reflect burgeoning concern over use of benzodiazepines, a class of sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs prescribed for sleep problems, she said. . “Use of conventional sleeping pills, like benzodiazepines, is of some concern,” she said. “Melatonin is a product that has a good safety profile.” . Nonetheless, Briggs advises parents to discuss the use of yoga, melatonin and any health practices with their pediatricians.  . In addition to yoga and melatonin, researchers looked at dietary supplements other than vitamins and minerals as well as chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, meditation, acupuncture, massage, homeopathy and biofeedback. . Children with private health insurance were more likely to use chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation than children with public coverage. In 2012, children whose parents had more than a high school education were seven times more likely to use a complementary health approach as children whose parents had not completed high school, the study found.  . The results don’t explain why a higher level of parental education led to more complementary health practices for children, Nahin told Reuters Health. But, he said, more educated parents might be better equipped to identify complementary approaches and practitioners. . Wendy Weber, NCCIH branch chief for clinical research, said complementary medicine holds “some areas of great promise.” In particular, she cited probiotics and mindfulness-based stress reduction. . During the news conference, Weber advised parents to ask their teenagers about weight-loss and sports-enhancement products and to keep in mind that children are not just small adults. . “While most of the body-mind approaches seem relatively safe, we don’t know if they’re appropriate for all children,” she said. “Just because it’s something natural, doesn’t mean that it’s always safe to use.”  . She urged parents to consult healthcare professionals whenever children show symptoms.  . “It’s extremely important not to delay treatment with a known, proven therapy,” she said.  . SOURCE: .

James Harding Giahyue|MONROVIA (Reuters) - The United States military officially ended a mission to build treatment facilities to combat an Ebola outbreak in Liberia on Thursday, months earlier than expected, in the latest indication that a year-long epidemic in West Africa is waning.  . Washington launched the mission five months ago and the force peaked at over 2,800 troops at a time when Liberia was at the epicenter of the worst Ebola epidemic on record.  . Nearly 10,000 people have died in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea over the past year. More than 4,000 of those deaths were in Liberia, but the number of new cases has plummeted in recent months, leaving many treatment centers empty and the mission has already begun winding down.  . “While our large scale military mission is ending...the fight to get to zero cases will continue and the (Joint Force Command) has ensured capabilities were brought that will be sustained in the future,” said U.S. Army Major General Gary Volesky. . The troops were deployed to support the international Ebola response mission led by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The operation was initially expected to last between nine and 12 months, said Volesky, the mission’s commander. . Speaking to lawmakers during a visit to Washington on Thursday, Liberia’s President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf thanked the United States for its support during the crisis.  . U.S. soldiers built treatment centers, set up mobile testing labs, and provided transportation and logistical support. Military medical teams trained around 1,500 local health workers. . “A lot of our health workers of this country died during the course of the Ebola crisis,” Liberian nurse Juma Kollie told Reuters. “There was a need to have some attention giving to them. So the American government came in that direction.” . The force will withdraw over the coming weeks but more than 100 soldiers would remain in the country for several months to monitor the disease.  . “We are not turning our backs. We’re transitioning to a civilian operation that is already supporting more than 10,000 civilians who are working in the region,” U.S. Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Linda Thomas Greenfield said on Wednesday. .

Kieran Guilbert|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The addition of highly nutritious foods and supplements to the diets of poor mothers could help reduce child mortality and malnutrition in Africa and South Asia, food experts said on Thursday.    . With breastfeeding, fortified foods, including wheat-based products like porridge and micronutrient powders, are critical for children in the first two years of life, according to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a group of governments, businesses and non-governmental organizations working to reduce malnutrition.  . “Poor families often share one meal prepared for the whole family without taking a child’s nutritional needs into account,” GAIN’s executive director Marc Van Ameringen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  . “Rather than trying to change the diet, adding micronutrients like vitamin A, zinc and iron gives children key nutrients that they need to grow and thrive,” he said, adding that GAIN hopes to reach 25 million children in 2015. . Hunger and poor nutrition cause almost half of deaths among children under the age of five, or some 3 million every year, according to the United Nations.  . Around 805 million people worldwide don’t get enough to eat, including more than 200 million children.  . In addition to engaging with local communities to educate people about the need for nutrient-rich foods and supplements for infants, it is also crucial that these items are affordable and accessible for those most in need, Van Ameringen said. . Several countries, including India and Brazil, have government programs for mothers and children that provide necessary nutrition, and GAIN is building on these networks to reach more people, he said.   . Yet many countries in the world, particularly in Africa, lack such initiatives, Van Ameringen said.  . While hunger levels have fallen by 21 percent since 1990, an increasing number of countries are dealing with malnutrition, said Francesco Branca, director of nutrition for health and development at the World Health Organisation. . Hunger and poor nutrition among children are widespread across Africa. India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh are among the hardest hit countries in terms of the numbers of children affected, Branca told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . “We need to promote and protect breastfeeding alongside complementary foods, and ensure that mothers are well informed by leaders in the community,” Branca said. |Thu Feb 26 22:00:02 +0000 2015||Food supplements crucial to reduce child malnutrition |5.710671880371937e+17|http://reut.rs/1DfdiJn
Will Dunham|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A drug derived from a Chinese medicinal herb is showing promise for combating Ebola infection, effectively imprisoning the virus inside cells so it cannot do its usual damage, scientists said on Thursday. . The researchers said the compound, called tetrandrine, blocked infection of human white blood cells in lab dishes and prevented Ebola virus disease in lab mice. More research is needed, including monkey studies, before it can be tested in people, they added. . “The work has revealed a new chink in the armor of Ebola virus,” said virologist Robert Davey of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio, who estimated this approach potentially could be used to treat people in two to five years. . “I am hopeful that the dose needed to control disease will be safe but we just have to do the work and find out,” Davey added.  . There is no approved drug treatment or vaccine for the Ebola virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads person to person through contact with body fluids. . “In my opinion, tetrandrine is now one of the most promising candidates that could be used to inhibit Ebola virus infection,” said Norbert Klugbauer, a pharmacologist and microbiologist at Germany’s University of Freiburg who also worked on the study published in the journal Science. . To successfully infect a cell, the virus needs to be transported deep within it in order to break out of bubble-like intracellular transport structures called endosomes that carry the virus within the cell. . The researchers identified channels that are important in controlling the movement of the “bubbles” within cells. These are known as “two-pore channels.” The study showed that tetrandrine blocked these channels, effectively imprisoning the virus inside the “bubbles” so it could not actually infect the cell. . “The virus is then trapped in the bubble and cannot escape. It is then detoured to be destroyed. This stops infection,” Davey said. . In human cells in lab dishes, the researchers found  tetrandrine inhibited infection by the virus of white blood cells called macrophages. These cells are important players in the immune system’s ability to ward off foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria, basically swallowing them up. . Tetrandrine is derived from the root of a medicinal herb, Stephania tetrandra. It also lowers blood pressure. . More than 9,500 deaths have been reported in three West African countries since the world’s worst Ebola outbreak began in December 2013. |Thu Feb 26 21:10:29 +0000 2015||Compound from Chinese medicinal herb shows promise for Ebola |5.710547208712315e+17|http://reut.rs/1Df4T8I
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - Ninety-seven percent of hepatitis C patients also infected with HIV were cured of the liver-destroying virus after 12 weeks of treatment with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s daclatasvir and Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi, according to data from a study presented on Thursday. . The results could help put Bristol’s hepatitis C program back on track in the United States, following a setback last year. . In the Ally-2 study, including new patients and those not helped by prior treatment, 149 of 153 were deemed cured of hepatitis C regardless of what other anti-viral regimens they were on for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. . “The results of Ally-2 signaled that nearly all HIV-HCV coinfected patients in the study could be cured of hepatitis C with a 12-week regimen on daclatasvir and sofosbuvir,” Dr. David Wyles, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement, using the chemical name for Sovaldi. . There were no reported serious side effects related to the hepatitis drugs, and patients did not require any alteration of HIV medications over potential drug-drug interactions. . “This is a paramount consideration for clinicians treating this patient population,” added Wyles, who presented the data at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) meeting in Seattle. . About 300,000 Americans with HIV also suffer from hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making them prone to more rapid progression to liver damage. . Daclatasvir is approved in Europe, Brazil and Japan as part of combination therapy, but has fallen behind rivals in the world’s most lucrative market. In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve daclatasvir in combination with other antiviral drugs. . The company had sought FDA permission to market daclatasvir in combination with another Bristol drug, asunaprevir. But Bristol abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir due to potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. . The FDA asked for new data on daclatasvir with other drugs, which the Ally results could help satisfy. . Sovaldi is part of Gilead’s market-leading hepatitis C franchise and half of its own one-pill-per-day combination treatment Harvoni. . All 26 patients in the Ally-2 study with the less common genotypes 2, 3 and 4 of the virus were cured by the combination. A shorter eight-week regimen tested among 50 patients led to a 75 percent cure rate. |Thu Feb 26 20:39:03 +0000 2015||Bristol hep C drug helps cure 97 percent of HIV coinfected patients: study |5.710468074946437e+17|http://reut.rs/1DeZOgH
Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) - - Failing kindergarten was the first of many school struggles for Blake Charlton. Diagnosed with dyslexia, he was relegated to remedial classes that he barely passed. Now, at 35, reading still poses a challenge. He’s a self-described “crummy” speller who manages written communications by relying on abbreviations. People who recall his academic difficulties are often surprised at the abbreviation that now follows his name: M.D. . “For much of high school and college, I didn’t think medical school was a possibility,” said Charlton, who’s now a medical resident at the University of California, San Francisco and an editorial fellow for the American Medical Association journal JAMA Internal Medicine. “I spent a lifetime having to ride the short bus, identifying as someone who needs help.”    . Several years after Charlton finished college, his father was diagnosed with cancer. Caring for his father, Charlton realized that his desire to become a doctor outweighed his fear of failure.  . Receiving time accommodations to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), Charlton earned entry into Stanford University School of Medicine. Most classmates didn’t know of his disability, and his patients don’t, either.  . Charlton is a dyslexic doctor, and although studies are scant, researchers say he is one of many. Charlton knows of two others at UCSF alone. . According to the Dyslexia Research Institute, up to 15 percent of Americans are affected by this neurological difference, resulting in language, perceptual and processing difficulties. The percentage of dyslexic doctors is difficult to measure, as many fear that disclosure could thwart professional development and compromise the trust of patients.  . For a recent paper in the Postgraduate Medical Journal, Jean Robson at Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary in Dumfries, UK, and colleagues interviewed seven dyslexic first-year physicians in the Scottish National Health Service. Most said they had not disclosed their dyslexia and had experienced difficulty with communication, time-management and anxiety. (The paper is online here: . ) . Commenting on those interviews, Dr. Sally Shaywitz, a physician and professor of learning development at the Yale University School of Medicine, told Reuters Health, “I think it’s a really important topic but an extraordinarily small sample. One doesn’t know how representative it is, because there was no control group.”  . Shaywitz cites a need for more research into the experiences of dyslexic doctors, whom she says are far more numerous than most believe. . “They worry what others will think, because there is terrible misinformation that people who are dyslexic aren’t smart,” Shaywitz said. “But because they have difficulties reading, they have learned to be very careful.”  . Charlton said his first-hand awareness of personal deficiencies has made him a compassionate physician. He also said he re-reads everything he writes, never failing to run a spell-check. Being careful doesn’t distinguish him among colleagues, however. “Doctors are very meticulous people,” he said. “You wouldn’t get to where we are if you were not.” . Radiologist Beryl Benacerraf is one of those meticulous dyslexic doctors. She’s also a Harvard Medical School professor who was an adult before her dyslexia was diagnosed. When Benacerraf entered medical school in the mid-1970s, she says it wasn’t due to academic achievement or test scores. She credits her father, immunologist Baruj Benacerraf, who later won a Nobel Prize, with pulling strings at Harvard. That help was all she needed. . “I never was accommodated, I had to swim in the waters with everybody else,” Benacerraf said. She developed “work-arounds,” relying on lectures more than textbooks. She now considers her dyslexia to be a gift. Because she was naturally good at pattern recognition, radiology was a perfect fit. (She gets to look at images rather than read words.)  . “You develop the ability to be a big-picture person rather than a detail-oriented person,” Benacerraf said. “Dyslexics think much faster, and it’s a more creative way of thinking. I’m very proud of it.”  . Charlton agrees. “A lot of us are coming to realize that there are significant downers, but there are certain things we tend to be pretty good at. There’s no reason to suppose that people with this kind of brain are not good at things.” |Thu Feb 26 20:39:02 +0000 2015||Dyslexia needn’t hold doctors back |5.7104680573721395e+17|http://reut.rs/1DeZOgJ
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory committee on Thursday recommended meningitis B vaccines for people at high risk aged 10 to 25, a population that Pfizer Inc and Novartis criticized as too narrow. . Pfizer’s Trumenba, like Novartis’ new vaccine Bexsero, recently won U.S. marketing approval to treat the “B” strain of the deadly bacterium in that age group.  . Older vaccines have long been available in the United States and broadly recommended to protect millions of children and young adults against infection with four other serogroups, or strains: A, C, Y and W. . The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was more selective on Thursday in its unanimous recommendation of vaccines against serogroup “B,” saying they would be appropriate for an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 people at high risk, largely those with specified pre-existing medical conditions or who have professional exposure to the bacterium. . “Today’s high-risk recommendation does not cover the majority of adolescents and young adults in the United States who are at risk for contracting meningitis B,” Novartis said in an emailed statement. The Swiss drugmaker said the panel’s recommendation was nonetheless “a step forward.” . Novartis said it hopes the panel will vote for a broader vaccination recommendation at its next meeting in June after weighing testimony from college officials and others concerned about student vulnerability to outbreaks. . Meningitis can be treated with antibiotics, but 10 percent to 15 percent of patients die and up to 19 percent of survivors have long term disabilities, including brain damage and limb amputations. Vaccination is deemed the best way to prevent the disease. . Novartis’ vaccine, called Bexsero, was sold in dozens of countries before being approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month. Even before getting the nod, it was provided last winter to students at Princeton University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, in response to meningitis B outbreaks on both campuses. . Pfizer and Novartis had both won the FDA’s coveted “breakthrough therapy” designation for their rival vaccines. . In October Pfizer’s Trumenba became the first approved U.S. vaccine against serogroup B of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis.  . It causes disease in an estimated 20,000 to 80,000 people a year globally. The FDA estimates serogroup B causes about 160 meningitis infections annually in the United States. |Thu Feb 26 20:18:49 +0000 2015||Pfizer, Novartis say meningitis vaccine scope too narrow |5.710417178954793e+17|http://reut.rs/1E0JN3x
Alistair Bell|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - (This version of the Feb. 24 story corrects the percentage of people who think parents should be allowed to choose whether to vaccinate their children, to 43 for and 48 against, instead of 38 and 44, in third to last paragraph) . A large majority of Americans favor mandatory vaccinations of children, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday, apparently unswayed by some senior Republicans who have raised fears the medical shots could lead to autism. . Seventy-eight percent of respondents in the online survey said all children should be vaccinated unless there is a direct health risk to them from vaccination. . Only 13 percent opposed vaccinations.   . “The numbers are absolutely overwhelming in favor of vaccinations with a consistent minority in opposition,” said Ipsos pollster Julia Clarke. . Republican Senator Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist and potential 2016 presidential candidate, this month revived a long-running controversy over vaccinations when he said he had heard of instances where vaccines caused mental disorders. . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another possible Republican presidential hopeful, said parents needed a “measure of choice.” But his spokesman later said the governor believed kids should be vaccinated against measles.      . The disease was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, but a measles outbreak that began in California in December has shone a spotlight on an anti-vaccination movement based mostly in California and the Pacific Northwest.     . Theories of a link between vaccines and autism have led some parents to refuse to have their children inoculated, even after those theories have been debunked.  . The Reuters-Ipsos poll showed the number of people opposed to vaccinations was significantly higher in the Far West, at 17 percent, than anywhere else in the country.      . “It’s to do with the no-vaccination movement possibly originating there like an epicenter,” Clarke said. . The data also suggests support for not vaccinating children “does appear to be correlated with what I’d call libertarian or anti-authority tendencies and sentiment,” Clarke said. That support tends to be from people who lean more toward the Republican or Tea Party but are much more likely to identify themselves as independent, she said.    . Older people are clearly more supportive of vaccinations than younger people, the survey showed. . Overall, 71 percent of Americans think public schools should be allowed to suspend unvaccinated children when there is a major disease outbreak.  . Forty-two percent said a politician’s position on vaccinations would have a major impact on whether they voted for him or her. Thirty-five percent said it would not. . Asked whether parents should be allowed to choose whether to vaccinate their children, 43 percent backed that idea while 48 percent opposed it. . A sample of 6,012 Americans over 18 years old were interviewed online for the survey between February 4-23.   . The precision of Reuters/Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. |Thu Feb 26 19:49:35 +0000 2015||Big U.S. majority favors mandatory vaccinations: Reuters/Ipsos poll |5.710343610988503e+17|http://reut.rs/1DeRIVo
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Nasal-spray flu vaccines appear to be safe for children over age two who have egg allergies or asthma, say UK researchers. . No systemic or severe allergic reactions were seen among 282 egg-allergic children who received the vaccine. Eight kids had mild reactions, such as a runny nose and 26 reported coughing or wheezing up to three days after the vaccine.  . Nasal-spray vaccines containing live but disabled influenza virus, known as live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), are cultured in chicken eggs and contain traces of egg proteins.  . “On the basis of this data, we do think the intranasal flu vaccine (LAIV) is safe in children with egg allergy,” said Paul Turner, who led the new study, in an email. . “We still need to analyze our data with regards to safety in children who also have asthma, but the preliminary data indicates that children with well-controlled asthma who are well at the time of vaccination do not experience any significant respiratory problems following LAIV,” said Turner, an allergy and immunology researcher at Imperial College London. . Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies in childhood, affecting an estimated two percent of preschool-age children, Turner and his colleagues write in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. . The nasal flu vaccine is considered more effective than flu shots. It was added to UK vaccination guidelines for children in 2013, but not for kids with egg allergies. That’s about 60,000 children in the UK, for whom flu shots – preferably given in a hospital setting – are still advised, which the authors say represents a “significant barrier to successful implementation of the immunization program.” . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends nasal flu vaccines for healthy children between two and eight years old, but also excludes those with asthma or allergies to eggs.  . Turner and his colleagues enrolled children ages two to 17 who had been diagnosed with egg allergy, including 186 kids who also had a history of asthma. . The kids were given at least one dose of nasal flu vaccine between September 2013 and January 2014. A total of 151 received the recommended second dose of vaccine.  . The children were observed for at least one hour after inhaling the vaccine for symptoms of local or systemic allergic reaction, and parents were contacted by telephone after a minimum of 72 hours to see if any of the children had delayed reactions.  . While no systemic or severe reactions occurred, there were 14 mild reactions reported within two hours of vaccine administration, eight of which could have been allergy-related.  . Delayed adverse events occurred in 91 children, including 59 cases of upper respiratory symptoms and 20 cases of fever. These events appeared to be similar to previous reports of adverse events for kids without allergies, the researchers note. . The study team found that children with asthma were not more likely to experience any adverse events compared to the other kids.  . Turner said that he and his colleagues also performed a sub-study in which they measured how much egg protein must be sprayed into the nose to cause symptoms. . “On the basis of this data, we think it is highly unlikely that where a child experiences nasal symptoms, it is due to the egg in the vaccine,” he said. “We think it’s far more likely they are having symptoms due to other vaccine ingredients - in which case the risk of this in egg-allergic children is no higher than in any other child.” . Dr. James Sublett, a pediatric allergist and president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said there is accumulating evidence that kids who have egg allergies definitely should not avoid vaccines, including flu, measles and other vaccines that potentially have of traces of egg proteins. . “Kids who have egg allergies can get vaccinated - it’s a matter of sorting out how allergic they are to the egg, what their risk is, and then working with their pediatrician and a board certified allergy immunologist to try to figure out which is the best pathway to go with the vaccines, because I think the real key is that we don’t want children not vaccinated,” said Sublett, who was not involved in the study. . Turner said that clearly, there is a herd immunity effect in flu vaccination, but that children with asthma are also at risk of increased complications from influenza infection.  . “So I would argue that for these children, there is also a clear benefit of the vaccine on a personal level,” he said.  . Nasal flu vaccines cost around 40 dollars in the U.S., which is about 10 dollars more than flu shots. . SOURCE: .

|LONDON (Reuters) - A global fund to speed development of new antibiotics to counter the growing threat of drug-resistant superbugs is likely to need up to $2 billion, the head of a review backed by the British government said on Thursday. . Former Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O’Neill has urged the establishment of an innovation fund to support research, arguing that far too little is currently invested in hunting for  new drugs against drug-resistant infections. . “We’ve not yet come up with a number,” O’Neill told an Economist pharmaceuticals conference on Thursday, when asked how big the fund would be. “My guess is probably no more than $2 billion.” . The problem of infections becoming drug-resistant has grown in recent years as bugs resistant to multiple drugs have developed and drugmakers have cut back investment in this field. . O’Neill, who was asked last year by British Prime Minister David Cameron to take an economist’s view of the issue, said earlier this month that philanthropists and governments should create a new fund to support drug research. . In his first assessment of the threat, O’Neill estimated that so-called anti-microbial resistance (AMR) could kill an extra 10 million people a year and cost up to $100 trillion by 2050 if it was not brought under control. |Thu Feb 26 17:32:23 +0000 2015||O'Neill eyes up to $2 billion for fund to fight superbugs |5.709998325649244e+17|http://reut.rs/1DevzXq
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medics, firefighters and a hazardous materials team investigated a possible case of the deadly Ebola virus in a Virginia suburb of Washington on Thursday, an official said. . Emergency crews transported a patient from an apartment in the Clarendon section of Arlington County to Virginia Hospital Center using Ebola precautions, said Lieutenant Sarah-Maria Marchegiani of the county’s fire department. . Marchegiani said the patient had recently traveled to a country affected by Ebola and exhibited symptoms of the disease. . The patient was unlikely to be suffering from the disease, Marchegiani said. . Nearly 10,000 people have died from Ebola in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries hit hardest by the outbreak. . At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States, and two people are known to have contracted the virus in the United States. . Calls to the hospital were not immediately returned. |Thu Feb 26 17:18:54 +0000 2015||Emergency responders investigating possible Ebola case in Virginia: local media |5.7099643867252736e+17|http://reut.rs/1Det9I8
Roxanne Nelson|"(Reuters Health) - Among its many rewards, eating a healthy diet might help protect against the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, according to a new study.  . Based on more than 120,000 men and women followed for more than a decade, researchers calculate that those who ate a diet highest in whole grains, vegetables and nuts, and lowest in red meats and sugars were up to a third less likely to develop COPD – even if they smoked - than those who ate the worst diet. . “I think that we need to emphasize the role of diet in respiratory diseases, which is largely unknown by the general audience,” lead author Dr. Raphaëlle Varraso, from the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Villejuif, told Reuters Health in an email. . “Respiratory health and lung function strongly predict general health status and all-cause mortality,” she said. . COPD is an umbrella term for a group of progressive lung diseases that block the flow of air and cause breathing problems. They include emphysema, chronic bronchitis and some types of asthma. . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 15 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and it is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. . “The predominant risk factor for COPD in the developed world is cigarette smoking, but up to one-third of COPD patients have never smoked, thus suggesting that other factors are involved,” Varraso said.  . But relatively little attention has been paid to modifiable factors, aside from smoking, that might reduce the risk of developing COPD, including diet, she noted.  . “As the lungs exist in a high-oxygen environment, it is reasonable to hypothesize that certain exposures can increase the burden of oxidants further,” she added. . Varraso and her team used U.S. data on 73,000 women and 43,000 men who were part of long-term studies that tracked their lifestyles and medical histories between 1984 and 2000.  . The researchers rated the participants’ eating habits based on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), which is a measure of dietary quality based on current scientific evidence about the effects of nutrients on health risks. High scores on this index - developed at the Harvard School of Public Health as an alternative to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s “food pyramid” - have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of major chronic diseases.  . A better score also generally represents a diet that is high in vegetables, whole grains, polyunsaturated fats, nuts and omega-3 fatty acids, low in red and processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks, and includes moderate alcohol consumption. . Those with the highest AHEI-2010 scores were 33 percent less likely to develop COPD than participants with the lowest diet scores, the study team reports in the journal BMJ. . The results held up even after the researchers accounted for other factors, such as tobacco use, exposure to second-hand smoke, weight, age and exercise habits.  . The study does not prove cause and effect, however, said Dr. Norman H. Edelman, senior consultant for scientific affairs at the American Lung Association. “It only suggests that there may be a link.” . Edelman, who was not involved in the study, added, “There has been evidence of this before, that one way to ameliorate lung disease is to eat a diet high in antioxidants. This study used a large database and suggests that diet may play a substantial role in lowering the risk.” . But the most important preventive action for lung health is still smoking cessation, Edelman emphasized. “This study doesn’t change that message,” he said.  . For those who would like to lower their risk of major chronic diseases, including COPD, Varraso pointed out that the AHEI guideline (. ) is ""quite easy"" to follow. . But for people who already have COPD, the role of diet may be different, she noted. “In our study we only investigated the role of a healthy diet on the risk of COPD.” . Varraso added that these study results should encourage clinicians to consider the potential role of the combined effect of foods in a healthy diet in promoting lung health.  . SOURCE: .

Janice Neumann|Reuters Health - Depression could be clouding the last 24 hours of life for a significant number of people with advanced cancer, pointing to a need for better – and earlier - psychological help, according to a large study from Norway. . Although it’s challenging to tease apart depression symptoms from the pain, fatigue and cognitive problems associated with end-stage cancer, more can be done to alleviate depression and anxiety, researchers said.  . “Health care providers may think this is a normal part of the dying process,” said lead author Dr. Elene Janberidze from the European Palliative Care Research Center at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. . “However, some patients experiencing depressive symptoms and/or depression can be treated and thus both the patients and their families may have a better quality of life,” Janberidze told Reuters Health in an email. . Previous studies have estimated the rates of depression in patients with advanced cancer at anywhere from 2 percent to 56 percent, she and her colleagues write in the journal BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care.   . Janberidze said that her team chose to focus on patients in their last 24 hours of life because this group had not been well investigated. . They used data from a 2005 nationwide survey of doctors who had signed the death certificates of patients that died within the past two months. The researchers examined data on 1,363 cancer patients during their last 24 hours of life, assessing the symptoms reported by their attending physicians and rating their level of depression.    . After accounting for symptoms of the individuals’ illness, the researchers found that overall 37 percent of patients were depressed. More women than men were severely or very severely depressed, and patients aged 17 to 65 were more likely to be moderately depressed than those 80 years or older.  . Geriatricians were four times more likely than other doctors to assess their patients as seriously or severely depressed. Pain specialists, palliative care consultants, psychiatrists and psychologists were also more often tending to patients with symptoms of serious depression than to those with mild or moderate depression.   . Mild or moderately depressed patients were more likely to feel tired, anxious and confused than those without depression symptoms. Individuals who were severely or very severely depressed also tended to feel anxious.   . Holly Prigerson, who directs the Center for Research on End-of-Life Care at Cornell University, said she admired the authors for trying to gauge depression in cancer patients who were so close to death. . “The study is novel in that it evaluates retrospectively the depressive symptom severity of patients within 24 hours of death,” Prigerson said in an e-mail to Reuters Health. “I’m unaware of any other study that has attempted this.”  . But Prigerson also noted some of the study’s limitations, such as trying to assess patients who could be unconscious or delirious, have multiple organ failure and difficulty communicating their emotions.  . Physicians also need to distinguish physical and psychological symptoms and might not always have enough information on a patient’s psychological state when they are dying or might not have enough training to diagnose their “psychological distress,” she said. . “It is also difficult to draw conclusions regarding the clinical implications of the study,”  Prigerson said. “Given patients are actively dying, it is doubtful that a psychosocial intervention or administration of an antidepressant will effectively improve the patients’ quality of death. . “Psychosocial interventions and care in the months and weeks leading up to the death can have a profound impact on patients’ quality of life prior to death, however,” Prigerson said. . Janberidze said doctors should be checking cancer patients for physical and psychological pain and integrating palliative care with their cancer management earlier in their disease. She also said family members could help monitor the patient’s pain. . “In general it is important for family members with loved ones who have advanced stage cancer to pay attention to the signs and symptoms of depression and inform healthcare providers immediately. Doctors should investigate the patient further and recommend psychological interventions as needed,” Janberidze said. . SOURCE: .

Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Sanofi’s new Toujeo diabetes drug is on track to receive a potential green light from European regulators this week, building on a U.S. regulatory approval awarded on Wednesday. . Toujeo is a more potent follow-up to the French drugmaker’s top-selling Lantus insulin product, which accounts for a fifth of group sales, and the new drug is pivotal to Sanofi’s diabetes business as Lantus faces loss of patent protection. . A committee of experts at the European Medicines Agency is considering whether to recommend Toujeo at a regular monthly meeting in London, according to the agency’s website. Decisions from such meetings are normally announced around midday on Fridays. . Assuming Toujeo gets a positive opinion, it is likely to be formally approved by the European Commission a couple of months later, allowing Sanofi to launch in its chosen first European markets of Germany and Britain.    . The U.S. approval for Toujeo disappointed some Sanofi investors because the wording on the drug’s label failed to spell out the benefits of Toujeo over Lantus. . In Europe, however, the labeling rules are different and Sanofi may be able to make more claims for Toujeo. . Pascale Witz, Sanofi’s executive vice president of global divisions, said she was confident doctors would recognize the benefits of using Toujeo, even if this was not spelt out on the U.S. label, because clinical studies about the drug had been published in major journals. . Toujeo has the same active ingredient as Lantus, called insulin glargine, but at three times the concentration and with a design to release the insulin more gradually. . The medicine provides similar blood glucose control as Lantus with lower rates of hypoglycemia, a potentially dangerous drop in blood sugar. . Witz declined to comment on the price of Toujeo but said “pricing will not be a barrier to access”. . Even with a competitive price, investors fear Sanofi may struggle to switch sufficient patients from Lantus to Toujeo. Many analysts see a modest switch rate of only around 20 percent, although Witz said that figure was too low. . “That’s a pessimistic view. We think it’s going to be more than that,” she said on the sidelines of an Economist pharmaceuticals conference in London. |Thu Feb 26 16:08:55 +0000 2015||Sanofi diabetes drug awaits imminent EU green light |5.709788299693343e+17|http://reut.rs/1DZWCLf
|SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A 14-year old Chilean girl with cystic fibrosis has asked to be allowed to die in a film she made pleading with President Michelle Bachelet to authorize her euthanasia. . In a video that news media said had been uploaded to her Facebook page on Sunday, Valentina Maureira said from her hospital bed: “I am asking to speak urgently to the president because I am tired of living with this sickness and she can authorize the injection to put me to sleep forever.” . Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs. . Maureira’s brother had died of the disease, her father, Freddy Maureira, told local Radio Bio Bio. . “She has already had five operations ... which have caused her a lot of suffering and pain,” he said. “It was promised that things would get better, but for her it was worse.”  . The video had surprised him, he added.  . A spokeswoman from the Universidad Catolica clinic in Santiago confirmed that Valentina Maureira was a patient at the hospital and said she was stable, with no immediately life-threatening conditions. . Government spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said on Thursday that the health ministry was in contact with the family to ensure Maureira was receiving the psychological and medical treatment she needed, but ruled out euthanasia as an option. . “We have to be completely clear, the current norm, the current law in Chile does not allow the government to agree to a request of this nature,” he said. . In Chile, as in many countries, euthanasia is against the law. The Catholic Church retains a strong influence on society, and the country is one of a handful to ban abortion under any circumstances.  . Center-left Bachelet, who is a year into her second term, has introduced reforms, including a bill being debated in Congress that would relax the abortion law. These have angered conservatives.  . Bachelet’s agenda has not mentioned euthanasia. |Thu Feb 26 14:58:47 +0000 2015||Chilean girl with cystic fibrosis tells president: Let me die |5.709611788994396e+17|http://reut.rs/1DZKslC
|(Reuters) - Diagnostics company Corgenix Medical Corp said on Thursday U.S. health regulators had approved its rapid Ebola test for emergency use, in response to the world’s worst outbreak of the virus that killed more than 10,000 so far. . The company’s ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test, which involves putting a drop of blood on a paper strip and waiting for at least 15 minutes for a reaction, was cleared by the World Health Organization last week. . The test is less accurate than the standard test, which has a turnaround time of 12-24 hours, but is easy to perform and does not require electricity. It is able to correctly identify about 92 percent of Ebola-infected patients and 85 percent of those not infected with the virus, the WHO said. . The WHO is still assessing four or five other rapid test candidates. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Roche Holding AG’s Ebola test, which takes up to three hours to generate results, for emergency use late last year. . Earlier this month, German drugmaker Stada said it would launch a test next month that can diagnose Ebola virus infections within minutes. . The FDA’s emergency use authorization is not intended for general Ebola screening, Corgenix said. . Corgenix’s pink sheet shares were up 3.5 percent at 27 cents in early trading. |Thu Feb 26 14:58:47 +0000 2015||FDA approves Corgenix's Ebola test for emergency use |5.709611771084718e+17|http://reut.rs/1De1IOI
Ben Hirschler|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has postponed a crucial meeting of an advisory committee to consider a cheap version of a top-selling drug for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, which had been scheduled for March 17. . The U.S. regulator said in a statement on its website late on Wednesday that the hearing was postponed “due to information requests pending with the sponsor of the application”. . South Korean firm Celltrion and its partner Hospira want to sell Remsima in the United States as a cut-price copy of Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co’s branded drug Remicade. . Copies of the drug, which contain the antibody infliximab, have been launched in recent days in major European markets. . The U.S. panel hearing is another major milestone in the advance of for the new type of medicines known as biosimilars, since a positive recommendation would pave the way for Remsima’s launch in the world’s biggest market.  . The FDA said a future meeting date would be announced in due course. . Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum said the delay appeared procedural and it was unlikely there were major issues over the clinical data supporting the product, given that Remsima has already been approved in Europe, Japan and Canada. . Remsima is seen as a litmus test for the acceptance of biosimilar versions of antibody drugs, which are among some of the world’s biggest-selling medicines and are used for diseases ranging from cancer to eye disorders. . Remicade had worldwide sales last year of more than $9 billion. . The potential of biosimilars to grab substantial business from original brands was a key factor behind Pfizer’s decision this month to buy Hospira for about $15 billion. . Because biotech drugs are made from living cells it is impossible to manufacture exact copies, as happens with simple chemical medicines, so regulators have come up with the notion of approving products that are similar enough to do the job. . Citigroup predicted this month that biosimilars would result in at least $110 billion of value being transferred from innovator companies to copycat producers between 2015 and 2025. |Thu Feb 26 12:57:16 +0000 2015||FDA postpones key hearing on biosimilar copy of blockbuster drug |5.709305984051323e+17|http://reut.rs/1DZqZ4J
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SA’s new Toujeo diabetes drug won U.S. regulatory approval, but with wording on its prescribing label that analysts say could make marketing difficult. . Toujeo is a more potent follow-up to the drugmaker’s top-selling Lantus insulin product, which accounts for a fifth of Sanofi sales. Sanofi is hoping to convert patients to Toujeo as Lantus is due to lose its U.S. patent protection this month. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration late Wednesday approved the once daily, long-acting basal insulin to treat type 1 and the far more prevalent type 2 diabetes. . Analysts noted, however, that lower rates of hypoglycemia, a potentially dangerous drop in blood sugar, seen in clinical trials comparing Toujeo to Lantus, was not mentioned on the FDA-approved label. It also highlighted the need for higher doses to achieve the same level of blood glucose control as Lantus. . “The Toujeo label is probably going to be viewed as more undifferentiated than investors have been expecting,” Bernstein analysts said in a research note. Citi analysts called the label “not great.” . Shares in Sanofi closed down 1.75 percent at 87.54 euros in Paris on Thursday. . Sanofi bought some patient conversion time with a patent infringement lawsuit filed last year against Eli Lilly and Co that keeps a cheaper Lantus generic off the market for 30 months. . In addition to gaining patients through conversions, “there’s about a million new patients for basal insulin each and every year,” said Joe Balzer, head of U.S. commercial operations for Toujeo, which is still awaiting European approval. . Toujeo has the same active ingredient as Lantus, called insulin glargine, but at three times the concentration and with a design to release the insulin more gradually. . Lantus is the world’s most prescribed insulin with sales of $7.2 billion in 2014. Warnings of faltering U.S. sales of Lantus contributed to the sudden sacking of Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher last year. . His successor, Olivier Brandicourt, is set to assume the top post at the beginning of April as Toujeo goes on sale. . The company has not revealed pricing for Toujeo and declined to discuss any potential discounting strategy in a market analysts see as becoming increasingly price sensitive. . More than 370 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation. As many as 95 percent have type 2, often associated with obesity which raises the risk of numerous serious health problems. |Thu Feb 26 11:36:07 +0000 2015||Sanofi's diabetes drug Toujeo gets U.S. approval, label disappoints |5.70910173939798e+17|http://reut.rs/1ETdeS4
Abhishek Vishnoi|MUMBAI (Reuters) - Shares in Wockhardt Ltd fell as much as 5.3 percent on Thursday after the Indian drugmaker said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had raised fresh concerns about a plant already banned from exporting to the United States over quality issues. . CEO Habil Khorakiwala, in an interview with channel CNBC TV18, did not specify the FDA concerns, which he said were raised after a week-long inspection of Wockhardt’s Waluj manufacturing plant in central India. But he said the issues were not serious and would likely be resolved within months. . Wockhardt’s shares closed 3.4 percent lower, while the wider NSE market fell 0.95 percent.   . “There were no serious observations,” Khorakiwala said. “We are dealing with those observations and we would be able to respond and correct all of them in next three-four months.” . A transcript of the interview was published on the TV channel’s website. . Waluj is one of seven plants in India owned by Wockhardt, which also has production facilities in the United States, Britain and Ireland. . Like other Indian generic drugmakers, the United States is the largest market for Wockhardt, accounting for 43 percent of its revenue in the quarter ended in September 2013. . The FDA has banned imports from the Waluj plant since May 2013 over concerns related to manufacturing practices. It has also imposed a similar ban on another Wockhardt plant in Chikalthana, western India. . The FDA does not publicly disclose the results of its inspections or give details about its observations.  . The FDA has in recent months raised concerns about manufacturing practices at the India-based plans of several  firms including Lupin Ltd and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. |Thu Feb 26 11:20:28 +0000 2015||India's Wockhardt says FDA raises new concerns about Waluj plant |5.7090623522831565e+17|http://reut.rs/1ETaIeF
|(Reuters) - South Carolina’s Supreme Court ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay a penalty of $136 million, upholding a jury’s finding that the drugmaker’s Janssen unit had improperly marketed its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal and concealed its risks. . A trial court had earlier ordered J&J to pay $327 million, but the Supreme Court more than halved that penalty, citing a provision in South Carolina law that no action can be taken in such cases after three years of the discovery of unlawful conduct. South Carolina filed its complaint in April 2007. . “Janssen’s desire for market share and increased sales knew no bounds, leading to its egregious violation of South Carolina law,” Justice John Kittredge wrote in the ruling on Wednesday. . “Yet, the absence of significant actual harm resulting from Janssen’s deceptive conduct leads us to conclude the trial court erred in part in its penalty assessment.” . J&J spokeswoman Pamela Van Houten did not immediately respond to a request for comment. . The state had sought civil penalties on two claims. . The first arose from the content of the written material of Risperdal prescriptions since 1994. The second claim centered on alleged false information contained in a November 2003 letter Janssen sent to South Carolina’s prescribing physicians. . The South Carolina ruling conflicts with decisions by two other states’ high courts last year. . J&J won a reversal of a $1.2 billion judgment by the Arkansas Supreme Court and won an appeal in Louisiana on a $258 million penalty. . Risperdal, launched in 1994, is used to treat conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and irritability in people with autism. . The drug and other anti-psychotic treatments have also been linked to side effects such as strokes, diabetes and weight gain. . The case is State of South Carolina v. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, No. 2012-206987.  |Thu Feb 26 10:28:42 +0000 2015||South Carolina court orders Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $136 million in Risperdal case |5.708932094523515e+17|http://reut.rs/1ET2bIy
Ian Simpson|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Possession of small amounts of marijuana became legal in the District of Columbia on Thursday, launching a pot “green rush” despite a face-off between local officials and the Republican-led U.S. Congress over the new standards. . The U.S. capital joined Washington state, Alaska and Colorado in making marijuana lawful for recreational use, reflecting a rapidly shifting legal landscape for the drug.    It remains illegal under federal law. . “Nationwide, it (legalization) is clearly symbolic in its ability to impact other places” in the United States, said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. . He called the new legal framework “depenalization” since sales were still barred, and said it was unlikely to unseat a thriving black market. City finance officials have estimated the marijuana market at $130 million a year. . Initiative 71, a ballot measure legalizing marijuana possession that was approved by 65 percent of District of Columbia voters in November, took effect at 12:01 a.m. . Oregon voters approved a similar measure in November, but marijuana does not become lawful there until July.  . The District of Columbia law allows adults to possess up to 2 ounces (56 grams) of marijuana and to grow six plants at home, three of them mature. Sales are barred but transfers of up to 1 ounce (26 grams) are legal. . Bongs, pipes and other paraphernalia are legal but public smoking is not. Marijuana is barred in about 20 percent of the city that is federal land. . Mayor Muriel Bowser and other city officials vowed on Wednesday that legalization would go ahead despite warnings from Republicans on the House of Representatives Oversight Committee that the move was illegal. . Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah contends a December spending bill had barred the District of Columbia from spending funds to make pot legal or lessen penalties. Congress has oversight over the District of Columbia. . Legalization has fueled what NORML’s St. Pierre called a “green rush” for entrepreneurs, users and growers eager to  explore the law’s limits and loopholes. . Michael Bayard, owner of Capital City Hydroponics, which sells indoor gardening equipment, said business had gone up about 50 percent since January as legalization neared. The store sells home marijuana kits for $420 to $1,200. . “We’re ready for the influx of people looking for exactly that kind of garden,” he said. . A marijuana expo sponsored by ComfyTree, a Michigan cannabis consultancy, and set for Saturday and Sunday has drawn dozens of exhibitors and hundreds of registered visitors. . The DC Cannabis Campaign, which spearheaded Initiative 71, plans to hold a seed exchange next month. The group’s leader, Adam Eidinger, whose paraphernalia shop was shut by police two years ago, is on course to re-open it. |Thu Feb 26 06:25:30 +0000 2015||Legal pot arrives in District of Columbia amid wrangle with Congress |5.70832004603904e+17|http://reut.rs/1DYr0FP
|YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar has culled thousands of poultry to try to contain an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Monywa, west of the commercial center of Mandalay, health officials said on Thursday. . The first outbreak of H5N1 in Myanmar was in the same region, about 525 miles (840 km) northwest of Yangon, in 2006and the last outbreak was in western Rakhine State in January 2011. . The disease was brought under control and was not known to have spread to humans. . An official said more than 1,400 chickens and 10,000 quail had died in the Monywa outbreak early this month and about 1,500 chickens and more than 20,000 quail had since been culled. . H5N1, which first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong, has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths. |Thu Feb 26 04:32:55 +0000 2015||Myanmar culls chickens, quail to contain H5N1 outbreak |5.7080367211812045e+17|http://reut.rs/1DY4zkl
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved Sanofi’s diabetes drug Toujeo, a more potent follow-up to the French drugmaker’s top-selling insulin product Lantus. . The Food and Drug Administration approved the once daily, long-acting basal insulin to treat adults with both type 1 and the far more prevalent type 2 diabetes. . The medicine is considered among the most important in Sanofi’s pipeline. The company is expected to try to convert patients from Lantus to Toujeo as quickly as possible, with the older drug about to lose U.S. patent protection. . Sanofi bought some time with a patent infringement lawsuit filed last year against Eli Lilly and Co that would keep a cheaper Lantus generic off the market for 30 months.  . In addition gaining Toujeo patients through conversions, “there’s about a million new patients for basal insulin each and every year,” said Joe Balzer, head of U.S. commercial operations for Toujeo, which is awaiting a European approval decision. .

The medicine provides similar blood glucose control as Lantus with significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia, a potentially dangerous drop in blood sugar. . Lantus, the world’s most prescribed insulin with sales of  $7.2 billion in 2014, accounts for more than 30 percent of Sanofi profit. Warnings of faltering U.S. Lantus sales contributed to the sudden sacking of Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher last year. . His successor, Olivier Brandicourt, is set to assume the top post on April 2, about the same time Sanofi plans to begin selling Toujeo. . The company has yet to announce a Toujeo price and declined to discuss any discounting strategy aimed at gaining reimbursement from insurers and other payers. . “We are confident of Toujeo achieving a position on payer formularies,” said Andrew Purcell, head of Sanofi’s U.S. diabetes business. . More than 370 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Some 90 percent to 95 percent have type 2, which is often associated with obesity and significantly raises the risk of numerous serious health problems. While most people with type 2 diabetes start with a variety of other medicines to control blood sugar, as the disease progresses many eventually require insulin. |Thu Feb 26 03:11:39 +0000 2015||FDA approves Sanofi's diabetes drug Toujeo |5.7078322278895206e+17|http://reut.rs/1ES5srv
Samantha Kareen Nair|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the use of Actavis Plc’s antibiotic, Avycaz, to battle drug-resistant bacteria known as superbugs. . The drug can be used in combination with generic antibiotic metronidazole to treat adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections. As a standalone medication, it is used to treat urinary tract infections. . Concerns about superbugs have escalated, especially after the UCLA Health System said last week that seven patients were infected with a potentially deadly, drug-resistant strain of the Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, and that more than 100 people might have been exposed to it. . Although a number of companies including Roche Holdings AG, Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals Inc, Achaogen Inc and Cempra Inc, are developing drugs for a variety of superbugs, Gabelli & Co analyst Kevin Kedra believes there is room for multiple players. . “As a doctor, you would like to have many potential tools at your disposal,” Kedra said. “The drug has shown good activity against a variety of tough-to-treat infections, and gives doctors another option, especially if their first choice runs into issues of resistance.” . He added that, at its investor day, Actavis estimated peak sales of about $250 million to $500 million for the drug. . Avycaz is a combination of a previously approved antibacterial drug called ceftazidime and avibactam, which protects ceftazidime from being broken down by certain enzymes that are produced by resistant bacteria. The drug is being co-developed with AstraZeneca Plc.    . The drug will be available in the second quarter of 2015. . After decades of low investment in antibiotics, pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention back to these drugs because of the spread of superbugs. . The World Health Organization warned in April of “a post-antibiotic era” in which common infections would once again become killers. .

Toni Clarke|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is poised to release initial data from a landmark study into how Americans use tobacco products, but researchers expect many key questions about e-cigarettes to remain unanswered. . The five-year Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study of about 46,000 people, begun in 2011, is expected to provide a wealth of data about smoking behavior that could shape regulations ranging from warning labels and advertising restrictions to new product approvals. . “It is going to provide the most fine-grain, comprehensive, highest quality data on tobacco use that has ever been collected in the United States,” said Stanton Glantz, a tobacco control expert at the University of California, San Francisco. . The FDA gained authority under a 2009 law to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco. It must issue new rules before it has authority to regulate e-cigarettes, cigars, hookahs and water pipes, among others. It has issued a draft proposal and is currently reviewing public comment before releasing final rules. . Some experts say the PATH study may not be able to capture crucial details about the use of electronic cigarettes, vapor tanks and other devices as tastes and technology are evolving so rapidly. . “While all this data that is being accumulated through the PATH study is great, it is unclear to me how much is going to be useful for setting the policy and regulations of the future.” said Scott Ballin, a health policy consultant based in Washington, D.C.  . The study is being funded by the FDA and administered by the National Institutes of Health. Responses from about 20,000 participants will be released on Thursday at the annual meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco in Philadelphia. . Each participant is being followed over time, allowing researchers to assess trends, such as which products are gaining in popularity and which are fading. Researchers are also collecting biological samples that will allow scientists to compare subjective responses about, for example, nicotine exposure, with physical data. . Kurt Ribisl, a professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, said the size of the study means researchers will gain unprecedented detail about specific groups of people. . Such detail could prove valuable to the agency as it weighs whether or not to ban menthol cigarettes, which are particularly popular in African American communities. . It is unclear whether the study will provide enough detail about e-cigarette use to answer public health questions about whether flavors in e-cigarettes attract youngsters to the products. Neither is there likely to be much data about average doses of nicotine consumed, since many vaping devices can be customized to release different levels of nicotine. . “When you get to e-cigarettes it’s really complicated,” Ribisl, who also sits on the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee. “It’s a vexing and complex issue.” |Thu Feb 26 01:10:09 +0000 2015||In landmark FDA tobacco study, e-cig questions likely to linger |5.7075264739495936e+17|http://reut.rs/1DXmE1I
Colin Packham|SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott backed plans on Thursday to introduce country-of-origin labeling in the wake of a hepatitis A outbreak, potentially risking contravention of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. . With 18 confirmed cases of hepatitis A linked to consumption of berries sold by Patties Foods Ltd, Abbott said he had asked members of his Cabinet to draft legislation by the end of March to provide greater transparency to consumers. . It marked a reversal of his previous position that such legislation would raise the cost of food. . Australia was among plaintiffs against the United States after it introduced its own stronger country-of-origin labeling laws for beef products last year. . The WTO ruled against the United States in October, arguing that country-of-origin labeling provided an incentive to favor domestic livestock. . Gerard McManus, a spokesman for Australia’s agricultural minister, said Abbott had told the minister to ensure the proposed legislation did not fall foul of WTO legislation. . Abbott had previously been reluctant to support country-of-origin labeling, insisting it would make food more expensive.  . However, he said on Thursday efforts would be made to ensure the impact would be as small as possible. . “We don’t want to add needlessly to the burdens of business but we do want to ensure that consumers get the information that they need and the public is protected. So we will do it in the most business-friendly way,” Abbott told reporters in Canberra. . The hepatitis A outbreak has been linked to poor hygiene and water supplies in a Chinese packaging plant. . Under current laws, the term “made from Australian and imported ingredients” is common, providing no details on the exact origins of all the ingredients in a product or where it was packaged. . Producers have increasingly sought to show their Australian credentials after a 2013 Roy Morgan poll showed more than 60 percent of Australians sometimes bought products because they were made in Australia even when they were more expensive than imported rivals. . Australia’s largest food processor and packaging company SPC Ardmona, owned by Coca-Cola Amatil, began declaring on its labels that all tinned products were Australian grown and canned after it was forced to seek financial assistance. |Thu Feb 26 01:10:09 +0000 2015||Australia to introduce country-of-origin labeling after hepatitis A outbreak |5.7075264558300774e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gx7vTd
|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinean President Alpha Conde on Tuesday replaced the minister of territorial administration with an army general in a move the government said was necessary to strengthen the fight against an Ebola outbreak in the West African nation. . A statement read on state-owned television announced the appointment of General Bourema Conde, considered to be among the president’s closest allies in Guinea’s army. . More than 14 months after the first Ebola case was reported in Guinea’s forest region, the government still faces pockets of often violent resistance to the campaign against the epidemic, undermining its plans to rebuild the health sector and economy. . The disease has killed a total of 2,091 people in Guinea since the outbreak was first identified, according to data released by the World Health Organisation on Wednesday. Nearly 10,000 people have succumbed to Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries hit hardest by the disease. . “Our objective is two-fold: to strengthen the mobilization of local authorities and to increase awareness of local communities (of Ebola),” government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara said in a statement on Wednesday.  . Bourema Conde replaces Alassane Conde, a civilian who had held the position since President Conde named his first government following his election in late 2010. He will continue to serve as a government minister with an advisory role to the president. None of the three men are related. . Conde’s election marked the end of a 2008-2010 military junta that seized power following the death of long-time dictator Lansana Conte. However, the polls were tainted by deadly riots and opposition complaints of fraud.  . As minister of territorial administration, Bourema Conde will be responsible for providing the independent electoral commission CENI with much of the logistical and technical support for presidential elections expected later this year. . Opposition figures were quick to criticize Conde’s decision to appoint a military figure to the position. . “The president had succeeded in getting rid of the soldiers, but to our amazement they are coming back and occupying strategic posts,” opposition politician Faya Bourouno said. . Since his election, Conde has prioritized luring investment into the mining sector and developing the country’s largely untapped iron reserves. |Thu Feb 26 00:02:34 +0000 2015||Guinea's Conde replaces key minister to boost Ebola fight |5.7073563999134925e+17|http://reut.rs/1GwPjZK
David Beasley|ATLANTA (Reuters) - A bill that would legalize medical marijuana in Georgia for patients with seizure disorders and other medical conditions cleared a big hurdle on Wednesday when the state House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation. . The bill, which faltered last year on the last day of the legislative session, passed the House by a vote of 158-2 and now goes to the Senate for consideration.  . It would allow patients with diseases including cancer and multiple sclerosis to use a non-intoxicating oil derived from the marijuana plant.  . To qualify, patients or their caregivers would have to register with the state Department of Public Health after getting a physician’s certification that they are being treated for one of the medical conditions covered by the bill.  . Georgia would become the 12th U.S. state to allow non-intoxicating oil for medical use, said Erik Altieri, spokesman for the pro-marijuana organization NORML. Another 23 states allow regular marijuana to be smoked for medicinal purposes, said Altieri. . The bill covers a “decent range of conditions” for medical marijuana use, said Altieri. A recent trend has been for legislatures to approve bills that only allow marijuana use in cases of seizure disorders, he added. . “We hope the Senate will support it as is and not amend it to be further restrictive,” said Altieri. |Wed Feb 25 23:10:53 +0000 2015||Georgia takes step toward legalizing medical marijuana |5.707226326409503e+17|http://reut.rs/1GwBpXD

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – - Weight loss surgery may reduce some of the pregnancy risks associated with obesity, but it could also put women and their infants at greater risk for other problems, according to a new study in Sweden. . Compared to obese women who didn’t have so-called bariatric surgery, women who did were less likely to develop diabetes during pregnancy and less likely to deliver overly large babies, researchers report in The New England Journal of Medicine. . However, the women who had surgery were more likely to have shorter pregnancies and to deliver smaller-than-normal babies. There was also a possible link to increased risk of stillbirth and neonatal death among the babies of women who had the surgery. . Bariatric surgery “has both positive and negative influences on the risk of complications during a subsequent pregnancy,” said Kari Johansson, the study’s lead author from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. . Johansson cautioned in her email to Reuters Health that the study shows ties between weight-loss surgery and pregnancy outcomes, but doesn’t prove cause and effect. . Weight-loss surgery reduces the size of the stomach, and in some cases bypasses part of the digestive tract.  . While it’s known that women who are overweight or obese have more pregnancy complications, the researchers say there is little information about pregnancy after weight-loss surgery. . Their new study involved nearly 3,000 Swedish pregnancies between 2006 and 2011 - including 596 in women who had weight-loss surgery within the previous five years, and another 2356 in women whose pre-pregnancy weight was similar to what the weight-loss surgery patients had weighed before their surgery. . Overall, there was no difference between the two groups in the risk of going into labor early. Also, there was no difference in the risk for birth defects. . Only about 2 percent of women in the surgery group developed diabetes during pregnancy, compared to about 7 percent in the non-surgery group. Also, about 9 percent of women in the surgery group delivered overly large babies, compared to about 22 percent of the non-surgery group. . But about 16 percent of women in the surgery group gave birth to smaller-than-normal babies, compared to about 8 percent of women in the non-surgery group. Also, the women who had surgery had pregnancies lasting 273 days, compared to about 278 days among the women who didn’t have surgery. Both of those durations are within the normal range, however. . The researchers also found that about 2 percent of pregnancies after weight-loss surgery ended in stillbirths or the death of infants within the first month of life, compared to about 1 percent of pregnancies in women who didn’t have surgery. . The researchers can’t say whether the increased risk of stillbirth or infant death was simply by chance, however. . “We therefore do not have a large enough sample to give any clear answer about this,” Johansson said. “This outcome needs to be studied further in even larger samples of patients.” . In an editorial, Dr. Aaron Caughey of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland wrote that other factors could influence complication rates, include complications during previous pregnancies. . Dr. Loralei Thornburg, who wasn’t involved in the new study, also pointed out that 98 percent of the women who had weight-loss surgery had the procedure that bypasses part of the small intestine. . “I think we have to interpret the findings with caution for different types of surgeries,” said Thornburg, who is a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. . She also said the study did not focus on many outcomes that may be better for mothers after weight-loss surgery, including their risk of death. . Thornburg, who said her center sees many women after weight-loss surgery, said women should always have discussions with their doctors before becoming pregnant – procedure or not. . She said women who had the surgery may need additional counseling about nutrition, care around remaining excess weight and possibly more monitoring. Additionally, they should talk about fertility before their surgery, she said. . “You should absolutely talk to your doctor,” Thornburg said. “Everyone should strive to be at a healthy weight and in a healthy lifestyle before they enter pregnancy.” .

Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Overuse of antibiotics made Americans more vulnerable to a strain of bacteria that caused nearly half a million infections and contributed to at least 29,000 deaths in a single year, U.S. public health officials warned in a study published on Wednesday. . The study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focused on the Clostridium difficile bacterium, which can cause deadly diarrhea. The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, highlight how overprescription of antibiotics has fueled a rise in bacteria that are resistant to treatment. . People who take antibiotics are most at risk of acquiring C. difficile because these medications also wipe out “good” bacteria that protect a healthy person against the infection.  . “Antibiotics are clearly driving this whole problem,” Clifford McDonald, CDC senior advisor for science and integrity, said on a conference call with reporters.   . One in every three infections occurred in patients 65 and older, the study found, with more than 100,000 C. difficile cases found in U.S. nursing homes.  The bacteria often spreads through the hands and equipment of health care professionals and hospital surfaces rife with bacteria.    . The rate of hospitalizations for C. difficile doubled from 2000 to 2010, according to the study, partly due to the emergence of a particularly dangerous strain, NAP1, that is more likely to cause infection in patients. It can produce a powerful toxin that causes deadly diarrhea and such severe damage to the bowels that part of the colon must be removed.   . The data used in the study are from 2011, and the rate of disease was projected to have continued increasing through 2012.  . Part of the increase comes from a more sensitive laboratory test that better detects the infection, McDonald said. . Yet much of the problem still lies in poor detection and diagnosis methods, CDC officials said.  . In 2010, for example, Brooklyn teacher Peggy Lillis, 56, developed painful diarrhea one morning, her son, Christian Lillis, told reporters. . After a telephone consultation, her doctor prescribed medication not suited to treating C. difficile. She died less than 36 hours later, after emergency room physicians diagnosed her with C. difficile.  . “C. difficile must be diagnosed quickly and correctly,” said Michael Bell, deputy director of CDC’s division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. |Wed Feb 25 22:30:28 +0000 2015||U.S. CDC warns overuse of antibiotics has fueled more infections |5.7071245996476006e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gwrd1f
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Heart failure patients who struggle with daily tasks like bathing or dressing are more likely to be hospitalized and tend to die sooner than those who are more independent, according to a new study. . More than five million people in the U.S. have heart failure, meaning their hearts cannot supply enough blood and oxygen to other organs, and about half die within five years of diagnosis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatments include medications, a low-salt diet and daily physical activity. . “I certainly suspected that patients who had increasing difficulty with daily living would be at increased risk for death,” but just how accurately a brief questionnaire could predict hospitalization and death was surprising, said Dr. Shannon Dunlay, lead author of the study and an advanced heart failure cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. . For the study, more than 1,000 people with heart failure, and an average age of 75, filled out questionnaires assessing their ability to perform nine activities of daily living, including feeding themselves, dressing, using the toilet, housekeeping, climbing stairs, walking and bathing.  . Many of the participants had other health problems like high blood pressure, diabetes or past strokes. . Those who had difficulty with things like bathing or housekeeping were classified as having “moderate difficulty” and those who struggled to feed themselves, use the toilet or dress themselves were classified as having “severe difficulty.” . Almost 60 percent of people reported difficulty with at least one of the nine activities. Around one quarter had moderate difficulty and 13 percent had severe difficulty.  . After about three years, more than half of the patients had died and more than 900 had been hospitalized at least once.  . The study team adjusted for other illnesses, and found that compared to people with no difficulty with daily activities, those with moderate difficulty were 50 percent more likely to die, and those with severe difficulty were more than twice as likely to die during the study. . Those with moderate or severe difficulty were also more likely to be hospitalized for heart problems or for any reason than those with no difficulty, according to the results published in Circulation: Heart Failure.  . People with heart failure tend to be elderly and to have other chronic health conditions, so it can be difficult to separate out what is actually causing the decline in function, Dunlay told Reuters Health. . Doctors do ask their patients about their ability to get around the house and complete daily tasks, but sometimes it can be hard to fit this conversation in with a regular clinic visit, Dunlay said. . Adding a quick questionnaire to the appointment could be a good tool for doctors to assess their patients’ risk of death and hospitalization, which can vary widely for people with heart failure, she said. Some patients do maintain most functional ability, while others will have severe disability. . Many patients become asymptomatic with therapy, according to Dr. Eldrin F. Lewis of the cardiovascular division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research. “Providers should always aim to get patients to the point where they can do all of the things that they enjoy,” he told Reuters Health by email. . “When I first meet a patient, I often ask them about their hobbies so that I can be realistic with them regarding their ability to eventually do those activities,” he said. . People who were older, female, unmarried and had other health conditions like diabetes, dementia or morbid obesity tended to have more difficulty with daily activities and were therefore at higher risk of hospitalization and death, the authors note.  . People who are married have a partner to help with daily tasks and may not notice their functional decline as much as those who are widowed, Dunlay said. Women may have worse outcomes because they tend to be slightly older than men when they develop heart failure. . “Certainly the next step is to better understand whether there are interventions we can do to improve or halt the progression of decline,” both to extend life expectancy and to improve quality of life immediately, Dunlay said. . “Is there an optimal time to catch patients, and intervene with physical therapy?” she said. “For some patients quality of life is as, or more, important than living longer.” . Even before a doctor asks, family are probably already aware that a person with heart failure is having trouble with daily activities, and shouldn’t hesitate to bring it up in the doctor’s office, she said.  .

|(Reuters) - Some 8.84 million people selected or were automatically enrolled as of Feb. 22 in an individual health insurance plan on the HealthCare.gov website created under the national healthcare reform law, the U.S. government health agency said on Wednesday. . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services extended enrollment for people who had tried to buy an insurance plan on or before Feb. 15 but were unable to because of customer lines at the call center or technical issues. Some 40,714 people picked a plan after enrollment closed on Feb. 15. . HealthCare.gov, created under the healthcare reform law often called Obamacare, sells plans in 37 states. The other states and Washington D.C. operate their own online exchanges. . The U.S. agency said that 90,000 consumers who had coverage in 2014 were not able to hold onto that coverage in 2015 because they lacked citizenship or immigration status documents, down from a previous estimate of 200,000 people. It said the figure is included in the total of 8,838,291 million plan selections.  .

Steve Bittenbender|LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - An outbreak of HIV among people injecting prescription drugs prompted health officials in southern Indiana to step up warnings on Wednesday against needle sharing and unprotected sex. . Since mid-December, the Indiana State Department of Health has confirmed 26 cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and four other people have been preliminarily diagnosed with the virus. . Department spokeswoman Amy Reel said the cases had popped up in Clark, Jackson, Scott and Washington counties, all north of Louisville, Kentucky, and Perry County, an hour west of Evansville. . Many of the cases in the five counties are tied to people injecting themselves with the prescription painkiller opana, which officials said was more potent than oxycontin. . “Because prescription drug abuse is at the heart of this outbreak, we are not only working to identify, contact and test individuals who may have been exposed, but also to connect community members to resources for substance abuse treatment and recovery,” Health Commissioner Dr. Jerome Adams said in a statement. . The state is working with health officials and providers in the region to try to contain the outbreak, according to the release.  |Wed Feb 25 20:33:04 +0000 2015||Painkiller abuse sparking HIV outbreak in southern Indiana |5.706829149224878e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWj87Y
|GENEVA (Reuters) - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone reported 99 new confirmed Ebola cases in the week to Feb. 22, down from 128 the previous week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. . Sierra Leone accounted for the bulk of the latest infections  with 63, signaling a halt to a steep decline recorded from December through January, followed by Guinea with 35 and Liberia just a single case, the U.N. agency said in its weekly report. . “Cases continue to arise from unknown chains of transmission,” the WHO said. Sixteen of the new cases were identified in Guinea and Sierra Leone after post-mortem testing of people who died in the community “indicating that a significant number of individuals are still either unable or reluctant to seek treatment.” . In all, more than 23,500 cases have been reported in the three West African countries, with more than 9,500 deaths, since the world’s worst outbreak began in December 2013. |Wed Feb 25 20:17:24 +0000 2015||99 Ebola cases in past week, nearly two-thirds in Sierra Leone: WHO |5.706789726122885e+17|http://reut.rs/1GvXEwI
Will Dunham|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Common additives in ice cream, margarine, packaged bread and many processed foods may promote the inflammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease as well as a group of obesity-related conditions, scientists said on Wednesday. . The researchers focused on emulsifiers, chemicals added to many food products to improve texture and extend shelf life. In mouse experiments, they found emulsifiers can change the species  composition of gut bacteria and induce intestinal inflammation. . Such inflammation is associated with the frequently debilitating Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis as well as metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that increase risk for type-2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. . Mice were fed emulsifiers diluted in drinking water or added into food, which were found to trigger low-grade intestinal inflammation and features of metabolic syndrome such as blood glucose level abnormalities, increased body weight and abdominal fat weight. . Consuming emulsifiers increased the risk of colitis, mimicking human inflammatory bowel disease, in mice genetically susceptible to the condition, the study found. . Georgia State University microbiologist Benoit Chassaing, whose study appears in the journal Nature, said the effects seen in mice “may be observed in humans as well.” . The study involved two widely used emulsifiers, polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose. The researchers are planning human studies and are already studying other emulsifiers. . Emulsifiers are used in margarine, mayonnaise, creamy sauces, candy, ice cream, packaged processed foods and baked goods. They can make products like mayonnaise smooth and creamy instead of an unappetizing amalgam of water and oily globules. . A key feature of inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic syndrome is a change in the gut microbiota - the roughly 100 trillion bacteria that inhabit the intestinal tract - in ways that promote inflammation. In mice given emulsifiers, the bacteria were more apt to digest and infiltrate the dense mucus layer that lines and protects the intestines. . Incidence of inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome started rising in the mid-20th century at roughly the same time that food manufacturers began widespread emulsifier use, the researchers said. . “We were thinking there was some non-genetic factor out there, some environmental factor, that would be explaining the increase in these chronic inflammatory diseases,” Georgia State immunologist Andrew Gewirtz said. . “And we thought that emulsifiers were a good candidate because they are so ubiquitous and their use has roughly paralleled the increase in these diseases. But I guess we were surprised at how strong the effects were.” |Wed Feb 25 20:17:23 +0000 2015||Study links common food additives to Crohn's disease, colitis |5.706789696175309e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWevLd
Ian Simpson|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legalization of marijuana in the District of Columbia will go ahead early on Thursday despite a warning from congressional officials that the new standards are unlawful, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. . She noted that voters in the U.S. capital last year overwhelmingly approved Initiative 71, which lets the heavily Democratic city join Washington state, Alaska and Colorado in making marijuana legal for recreational use. . “Our government is prepared to implement and enforce Initiative 71 in the District of Columbia,” Bowser, a Democrat, told a news conference flanked by council members, Police Chief Cathy Lanier and city Attorney General Karl Racine. . Her comments came in response to a warning on Tuesday from top Republicans on the House of Representative Oversight Committee that legalization was unlawful and opposed the will of Congress, which has oversight over the District of Columbia. . In a letter to Bowser, committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, head of a committee subpanel, said a December spending bill had barred the District of Columbia from spending any funds to make pot legal or lessen penalties. . But Bowser and other city officials contend that Initiative 71 was officially certified before the spending ban. The mayor on Tuesday outlined steps that the city was taking ahead of legalization, which takes effect at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday. . Initiative 71 allows adults to possess up to 2 ounces (56 grams) of marijuana and to grow six plants, three of them mature. Sales are barred but transfers of up to 1 ounce (26 grams) is legal. . Bongs, pipes and other paraphernalia are legal but public smoking is not. Marijuana possession is illegal under federal law, and pot is barred from about 20 percent of the district that is federal land. . Congressional opposition has also kept District of Columbia lawmakers from writing rules on how marijuana could be sold, regulated and taxed. . Bowser said Congress should not worry about District marijuana laws while the Department of Homeland Security faced partial shutdown because of a congressional deadlock over funding. . “Bullying the District of Columbia is not what his (Chaffetz’s) constituents expect, nor is it what ours expect,” she said. . Asked about Bowser’s pledge to move ahead with legalization,  Melissa Subottin, a Chaffetz spokeswoman, said: “Consequences do come with violating federal law.” . The District of Columbia already has one of the lightest U.S. penalties for pot possession. |Wed Feb 25 17:28:16 +0000 2015||Congressmen warn District of Columbia on pot legalization |5.706364111095644e+17|http://reut.rs/1DVbY3O

Andrew  M. Seaman| (This corrected version of the story fixes the spelling of study’s lead author to Schackman throughout article) . By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Preventing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in one person living in the U.S. saves more than $250,000 over their remaining lifetime, according to a new analysis. . Based on estimates of lifespan and medical costs from age 35 onward, researchers found that avoiding infection with the virus that causes AIDS saves from $229,800 to $338,400, depending on the amount of care a person receives. . Bruce Schackman, who led the study, said the savings may be even greater once non-medical costs are taken into account, including a person’s reduced productivity due to the infection. . “There are a lot of cost savings by avoiding HIV infections that weren’t included,” said Schackman, who is a professor of psychiatry and public health at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. . The savings estimates will help researchers and policymakers judge the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention methods, he said. The results, published in the journal Medical Care and presented Tuesday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle, are updates to 2006 estimates. . For the analysis, the researchers used data on healthcare and prescription drug costs to determine how much the average person with HIV will spend on medical care if infected with the virus when 35 years old. The 2006 estimate was $361,400 after adjusting for inflation. . To gauge medical costs, the study team also estimated the remaining lifespan of a 35-year-old infected with HIV and one who isn’t infected. In 2012, the estimated life expectancy of a person infected with HIV at age 35 was 29.5 years, they report. For an uninfected person the same age, life expectancy was an additional 38 years. . One model showed an infected person spending $435,200 on medical care over their remaining life if they immediately and consistently received treatment with a combination of drugs known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART. . Because many people are not immediately started on ART and oftentimes receive inconsistent care, the researchers ran a second model to simulate more typical healthcare costs. In that scenario, the average HIV-infected person would spend about $326,500 on care over their remaining years. . Those costs were then compared to $96,700, which is the average healthcare cost over the remaining lifetime of a 35-year-old not infected with HIV. . Schackman said it will be important to compare the estimated savings and the costs of HIV prevention methods, which include condoms and pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a daily dose of antiviral drugs.  . PrEP may reduce the risk of HIV infection by as much as 92 percent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The pill currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for PrEP is Gilead’s Truvada. . There are other costs aside from pills or condoms to take into account, including regular blood tests that check for infection, Schackman said. . He added that analyses are just starting to emerge on the cost effectiveness of PrEP, which costs between $8,000 and $14,000 per year, according to New York State’s Department of Health. . “I think that this certainly looks favorable for high-risk groups,” Schackman said. “So for people who are really at high risk of being infected, the benefits are going to be greater.” . The CDC recommends PrEP for gay or bisexual men who have condomless anal sex, or those who had a sexually transmitted infection in the last six months. The agency also recommends the pill for men and women who have condomless sex with people of unknown HIV status, or those who have sex with people at substantial risk of HIV, as well as for people who inject drugs. .

Jessica Dye|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three major U.S. tobacco companies including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, Lorillard Inc and Altria Group’s Philip Morris USA will pay $100 million to settle hundreds of federal lawsuits over smoking, according to an announcement from plaintiffs’ lawyers on Wednesday. . The agreement will cover more than 400 lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida by smokers or their families, according to the announcement. The settlement will not cover cases that have gone to trial or already reached a verdict.  . Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds will each pay $42.5 million, and Lorillard will pay $15 million, according to a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, Joe Rice of law firm Motley Rice.  . It is the first major agreement reached by the three companies to resolve a chunk of so-called Engle cases, named after a former class action brought by Florida residents over injuries or deaths they said were caused by tobacco-related medical conditions.  . In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court overturned a $145 billion award for the class and ruled that plaintiffs had too many individual issues to proceed as a group. However, the court said plaintiffs could bring individual lawsuits based on findings from earlier in the litigation that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco use can cause a variety of diseases, including cancer.   . After that ruling, thousands of cases were filed in Florida federal and state courts. In 2013, Liggett Group and its parent company Vector Group Ltd paid $110 million to nearly 5,000 smoking lawsuits against it.  . Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said the agreement was in the company’s best interests and that it intended to vigorously defend unsettled Engle cases, including those in state court.  . R.J. Reynolds Assistant General Counsel Jeff Raborn said the agreement presented a unique opportunity for the company, an indirect subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc, to put the federal litigation behind it.  . Lorillard was not immediately available for comment. |Wed Feb 25 16:18:34 +0000 2015||Tobacco companies to settle smoking lawsuits for $100 million |5.706188690496594e+17|http://reut.rs/1GuLpR7
Lawrence Hurley|(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a North Carolina state dental board does not have the authority to regulate teeth-whitening services, accepting the federal government’s claim that the system is anticompetitive because dentists sit on the panel. . The court, on a 6-3 vote, ruled for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which had decided that the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners could be subject to antitrust claims. . The justices, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, agreed with the government’s claim that although state entities are usually exempt from federal antitrust laws, the exemption did not apply because the board was not actively supervised by the state and because it was made up of self-interested private businesses. . Kennedy wrote that the exemption “does not authorize the states to abandon markets to the unsupervised control of active market participants.” . FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said she was pleased with the ruling and noted that the board had barred non-dentists from offering cheaper teeth-whitening services. . “The court’s decision makes clear that state agencies (the dental board) constituted in this manner are subject to the federal antitrust laws unless the state actively supervises their decisions,” Ramirez said in a statement. . The FTC filed an administrative complaint against the board in 2010, claiming it violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair methods of competition and deceptive acts and practices in commerce. . The FTC has said in court filings that the board is more akin to a trade association and was seeking to exclude non-dentists from the teeth-whitening market in order to freeze out potential competitors. . Prior to the board’s action, teeth-whitening services that were cheaper than those provided by dentists were available at malls and salons. Under North Carolina law, it has not been specified if teeth-whitening is a service that is exclusively under the purview of dentists. . In May 2013, the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the FTC. . The case is North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. FTC, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-534. |Wed Feb 25 15:49:17 +0000 2015||Supreme Court says state dental board can't regulate teeth whitening |5.706114976652124e+17|http://reut.rs/1GuAebd
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Antares Pharma Inc said its once-weekly testosterone injection met the main goal in an ongoing late-stage study in testosterone-deficient adult males. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked Antares last month for additional safety data on the drug, to be sold as QuickShot Testosterone, after a patient developed hives in a separate mid-stage trial. . The current late-stage study is testing the drug, known chemically as testosterone enanthate, in 150 patients whose testosterone blood levels are less than 300 nanograms per deciliter. . Detailed results from this trial are expected by early 2016, Antares Chief Executive Eamonn Hobbs told Reuters. . QuickShot Testosterone, or QST, is the only self-administered subcutaneous treatment in late-stage development, giving it an edge over existing injectables that must be administered directly into the muscle by a doctor. . Antares, whose shares were up 6.4 percent at $2.67 at midday on Wednesday, said it had already factored in many of the agency’s January recommendations in the late-stage study. . The company said it could need 70 more subjects exposed to QST for six months to meet the FDA’s requirements. . Antares is in talks with the agency to chart a path to procure the data, which could mean conducting a fresh trial or enrolling additional patients to ongoing trials, Hobbs said. .  “I’m personally leaning towards an additional small trial,” he said, adding that the company would like to start as soon as possible pending FDA approval. . Patients in the QST late-stage study will remain on the drug and will be monitored for an additional 40 weeks, but so far there have been no reports of hives, Antares said. . The FDA has become increasingly vigilant about testosterone products after it was revealed late last year that more than a fifth of males prescribed these drugs did not test their testosterone levels before or during treatment. . Prescriptions for low testosterone, or “Low T”, have soared over the past decade as middle-aged men face declining testosterone levels. . Up to Tuesday’s close, Antares’ stock has dipped about 4 percent since Jan. 13, when the FDA asked for additional safety data on the drug.  |Wed Feb 25 15:17:42 +0000 2015||Antares' testosterone injection found successful in late-stage study |5.70603552839766e+17|http://reut.rs/1Guqmhq
Martinne Geller|LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chen Chen, a 27-year-old financial analyst in Shanghai, has cut back on bottled milky tea in favor of fresh-squeezed juices. Like more and more of her compatriots, she wants to consume more natural ingredients and less fat and salt.  . “Health is a key factor,” she said.  . Chinese consumers like Chen are making new demands of international food brands, posing challenges for Western firms already grappling with slower sales and intense competition in the world’s most populous nation.  . Packaged food makers such as Nestle, Danone, PepsiCo and General Mills enjoyed fast growth in China as middle class consumers opted for convenience foods.  . Now conditions have become more difficult. Aside from the economy cooling, a government crackdown on gift-giving, local competition and increased labor costs, there is growing demand for healthier foods with fewer artificial ingredients that can be more expensive to make.  . Some Western companies have been caught flat-footed. . Never before have consumers changed so fast and so fundamentally as in China, Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said last week. “We lost touch ... we are working on plans to reconnect.” . Nestle reformulated its Chinese Nescafe coffee in 2012, saying at the time that coffee had gone from being “a pick-me-up” to “a social drink,” and people now expected “a richer more aromatic coffee”. . The firm is now looking at updating its Yinlu peanut milk brand to satisfy consumers who prefer fewer additives and alternative ingredients, and to modernize its Hsu Fu Chi confectionery brand. . Nestle does not break out country performance but analysts at Swiss bank Vontobel estimate it eked out 0.7 percent growth in China last year, with gains in brands like Nespresso offsetting declines for Yinlu and Hsu Fu Chi.    . Rival Unilever reported China sales down 20 percent during the second two quarters of last year as wholesalers and retailers reduced inventory because of the slowdown.  . The consumer market has been thrown into disarray over the last 12 months, said Jon Cox, an analyst at financial services group Kepler Cheuvreux. “Chinese consumers are being very discerning when it comes to consumer products.”        . Chinese consumers are sensitive about ingredients following  a series of food safety scandals, especially after tainted baby formula killed at least six infants in 2008. In 2013, a false alarm from dairy supplier Fonterra sparked a sharp decline in formula sales.  . Danone said last week that Chinese infant formula demand was improving, but it was benefiting premium brands sold online like its Nutrilon, rather than its mainstream Dumex brand.  . “E-commerce is a flight to safety for Chinese mothers,” said Danone Chief Executive Emmanuel Faber. . James Roy, associate principal at China Market Research Group, says consumers have always been concerned about safety, but are now increasingly concerned about nutrition.   . Some local brands have been using that as a selling point to challenge their international rivals. Food maker Cayman Islands Holding Corp has played up the image of natural ingredients and home cooking. Drinks maker Jiaduobao (JDB), which is challenging Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo, claims its canned herbal tea drink can put out internal “fires”, in a nod to traditional Chinese medicine.  . Local egg producer Zhan Wang, Chinese-owned cereal brand Weetabix, and PepsiCo’s Quaker brand have emphasized qualities such as healthy omega-3 content, “all natural” ingredients and zero additives. . “That is something we are advising clients to do a lot more, and it’s something you’re going to see more of going forward,” Roy said. . Sales of health foods were up 15 percent in China by the third quarter of last year, according to Nielsen data, versus just 5 percent for the wider market.  . Health has become the number one concern of Chinese urban consumers, according to the Nielsen Chinese Consumer Confidence Index. . “We believe more and more Chinese consumers would be willing to pay more for food with healthy attributes in order to keep fit,” said Kiki Fan, senior vice president of Nielsen China. |Wed Feb 25 14:28:18 +0000 2015||Health-conscious Chinese challenge Western food firms |5.705911170807112e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gublwc
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization in Europe called on Wednesday for measles vaccination campaigns to be stepped up across the region after recording 22,000 cases of the highly infectious disease since the start of 2014. . Saying she was “taken aback” by high case numbers, Zsuzsanna Jakab, the U.N. health agency’s European director, said the 22,149 reported cases from seven countries threatened the region’s goal of eliminating measles by the end of 2015. . Even though measles cases fell by 50 percent from 2013 to 2014, large outbreaks continue is both eastern and western Europe, the WHO said.  . Italy has seen 1,674 measles cases since the beginning of last year, while Germany has had 583, Kyrgyzstan 7,477 and Russia more than 3,240. . “We must collectively respond, without further delay, to close immunization gaps,” Jakab said in a statement. “It is unacceptable that, after the last 50 years’ efforts to make safe and effective vaccines available, measles continues to cost lives, money and time.” . Measles is a contagious and sometimes deadly viral disease which can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment and most people recover within a few weeks, but, particularly in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. . A measles outbreak in the United States has seen more than 150 people infected, many of them linked to the wave of illness that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December 2014. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But that status was lost after immunization rates were damaged by an anti-vaccination movement driven in the past decade by now de-bunked studies suggesting links between vaccines and autism. . In 2014, the United States had its highest number of cases in two decades. . Nedret Emiroglu, a WHO Europe’s infectious diseases expert, said beating the disease meant controlling any epidemics as quickly as possible and pushing vaccination rates to the highest possible levels in every country. . “All countries, with no exception, need to keep a very high coverage of regular measles vaccination so that similar outbreaks won’t happen again... and measles can be eliminated once and for all,” she said. |Wed Feb 25 11:59:30 +0000 2015||WHO calls for more measles vaccination in Europe as large outbreaks persist |5.7055367084632474e+17|http://reut.rs/1DTkuAf
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - Cheap versions of a top-selling drug for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease are being launched across major European markets in an important advance for a new type of medicines known as biosimilars. . The products from South Korean firm Celltrion and its partners Hospira and Mundipharma will compete with Remicade, the original branded drug from Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. . The potential of biosimilars to grab substantial business from original brands was a key factor behind Pfizer’s decision this month to buy Hospira for about $15 billion. . Unlisted Mundipharma said on Wednesday that it is launching its biosimilar Remsima in Germany, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, following expiry of  relevant Remicade patents. . Hospira is to sell its product Inflectra in markets including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. . Copies of Remicade have been on sale for several months in some smaller European markets, such as Norway, but the move into major economies is a big step forward for products that could disrupt the multibillion-dollar biotechnology industry.  . Because biotech drugs are made from living cells it is impossible to manufacture exact copies, as happens with simple chemical medicines, so regulators have come up with the notion of approving products that are similar enough to do the job. . Remicade, which has annual European sales of about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), and the two biosimilar copies all contain an antibody known as infliximab. . There has been a fierce debate for many years on how rapidly biosimilars will be adopted by doctors and the take-up of Remsima and Inflectra in the likes of Germany, France and Britain will be an important test. . Many more biosimilar copies of drugs for diseases ranging from cancer to eye disorders are now in development, posing a threat to leading biotech drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie. . Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum predicted this month that biosimilars would result in at least $110 billion of value being transferred from innovator companies to copycat producers between 2015 and 2025. . The upside for society is that they could generate an estimated $50 billion in savings for healthcare systems, Citi says. . Jorgen Jahnsen, professor of medicine and gastroenterology at the University of Oslo, said that in Norway the use of biosimilar infliximab had already enabled the healthcare system to make considerable savings. . Another test for biosimilars is looming in the United States, where a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee will decide on March 17 whether to recommend Celltrion’s biosimilar version of Remicade. .

Final payments will depend on the success of Orca’s so-called retinoic acid–related orphan nuclear receptor gamma inhibitors. |Wed Feb 25 07:38:08 +0000 2015||AstraZeneca taps biotech firm Orca for autoimmune disease drugs |5.7048789700408934e+17|http://reut.rs/1GspyJX
Ellen Wulfhorst|NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City has reached a tentative agreement with local rabbinical leaders regarding the Jewish circumcision ritual of direct oral suction in an effort to minimize health risks to infants, officials said on Tuesday. . The agreement aims to address health dangers associated with the ritual metzitzah b’peh, or MBP, which has been linked to a form of herpes that can be extremely risky to babies, city officials said. . In an MBP, a mohel who performs the circumcision uses oral suction to draw blood away from the wound on the infant’s penis. The procedure is sometimes performed in ultra-Orthodox communities. . Under the agreement, the city will no longer require that a mohel obtain signed consent before the ritual. . In 2012, the New York City Board of Health voted to require mohels to obtain such consent, in which parents acknowledged the risk of herpes infection, after officials identified 11 cases in which infant boys contracted herpes simplex virus after circumcisions believed to include oral suction. . Two of the boys died.    . Nearly three-quarters of adult New Yorkers are infected with the herpes simplex virus, most with no symptoms, but the  infection is very rare in newborns, officials said in the statement. . In babies, it can cause serious brain damage or death, they said. . Rabbinical leaders sought to block the requirement of signed consent forms and a federal court in New York had been set to decide if the requirement infringed on the constitutionally protected freedom of religion. . Under the agreement, which must be approved by New York’s board of health, hospitals and doctors will be asked to distribute information about the health risks. . If an infant is found to have herpes associated with an MBP, the rabbinical coalition has agreed to cooperate, for the first time, with health officials in identifying the mohel involved and ask him to be tested, city officials said. . If a mohel is found, by a DNA match, to have infected an infant with herpes, he will be banned for life from performing MBP by the health department, officials said. . “While the de Blasio administration continues to believe that MBP carries with it health risks, given the sacred nature of this ritual to the community, the administration is pursuing a policy centered around education of health risks by the health care community and respect for traditional practices by the religious community,” the administration statement said. |Wed Feb 25 00:54:47 +0000 2015||New York, Jewish leaders reach deal on circumcision health risks |5.703863890801336e+17|http://reut.rs/1GqKBwI
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - People diagnosed with major depression are around three times more likely than the general population to commit violent crimes such as robbery, sexual offences and assault, psychiatric experts said on Wednesday. . In a study based on some 47,000 people, the scientists emphasized, however, that the overwhelming majority of depressed people are neither violent nor criminal and should not be stigmatized. . “One important finding was that the vast majority of depressed persons were not convicted of violent crimes, and that the rates ... are below those for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and considerably lower than for alcohol or drug abuse,” said Seena Fazel, who led the study at Oxford University’s psychiatry department. . Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness, affecting more than 350 million people worldwide. Treatment usually involves either medication or psychotherapy, or a combination of both. . Andrea Cipriani, a clinical researcher and consultant psychiatrist at Oxford who was not directly involved in the study, said the results show how important it is to talk directly to depressed patients about how violent thoughts and behavior can be part of their illness. . “It’s relieving for patients to talk about what they feel. It’s relieving to know there’s a way out and it’s treatable,” he told reporters at a briefing. . Fazel’s team, whose work was published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, tracked medical and crime records of 47,158 people in Sweden diagnosed with depression and compared them with 898,454 non-depressed people matched for age and gender. . Following up for an average of three years, they found the depressed patients had a higher risk of both harm to others and self-harm. . When they adjusted for other factors such as previous history of violence, self-harm, psychosis and substance misuse — all of which increase the risk of violence — they found a smaller but still increased risk of violent crime among depressed people. . Fazel noted that in guidelines for doctors treating major depression, there is considerable focus on whether a patient is likely to self-harm or attempt suicide, yet little attention is given to violence. . He said the next step in the research would be to examine the links between depression and violence. . “Is it about not being able to think through things, not being able to make judgments about risk? Is it irritability? Impulsiveness?” he said. “If we can get more of a handle on that, it could really help treat these people.” |Wed Feb 25 00:21:03 +0000 2015||Clinically depressed three times more likely to commit violent crime |5.703779009538908e+17|http://reut.rs/1GqDBzV
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working to speed label changes for medical devices linked to a “superbug” outbreak in California, possibly to include new warnings and more stringent cleaning and disinfecting instructions, a senior official said. . Last week the FDA warned that the complex design of the reusable duodenoscopes, which are threaded through the mouth, throat and stomach and used in a variety of gastrointestinal procedures, makes them difficult to disinfect properly, even when instructions provided by the manufacturers are followed. Pentax Medical, Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Olympus Corp are the leading makers of these endoscopes.  . “We are working to expedite modifications to the label,” Dr. William Maisel, chief scientist in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in an interview. “We are also talking about updating the risk information.” . The urgency comes as the FDA faces some criticism for taking more than three years to issue definitive guidelines on the instructions manufacturers must give for disinfecting the scopes, a delay that critics say may have contributed to the failure to keep the devices from causing infections. . The outbreak may have exposed 179 patients to a potentially deadly, drug-resistant strain of bacteria at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles and contributed to two deaths. The FDA said last week that from 2013 to 2014 it received 75 reports, involving 135 patients, of possible contamination from reused duodenoscopes. . Maisel said that if a new cleaning method is established, the agency would expect companies to reflect that in their labels. One possible protocol is being developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is close to being finalized, the CDC scientist leading the effort told Reuters on Friday.  . Pentax Medical said in an e-mail it is talking to the FDA about updating its cleaning and sterilizing instructions, known as reprocessing. Fujifilm said it recommends strict adherence to the company’s reprocessing instructions but “reserves the right” to make new recommendations in the future “whether as a result of new industry practices, FDA guidance, or Fujifilm-specific updates to best practices.” . Olympus, whose devices were used in the UCLA outbreak, did not respond to questions about labeling changes. . Label changes, which can take months to complete, have been proposed in general terms before. But the latest outbreak has raised new issues that may require more specific measures to guard against infection from the flexible scopes, which are used to diagnose or treat disorders in about 500,000 procedures a year in the United States alone. . The FDA issued draft guidance on the labeling of reusable medical devices in May 2011, but such preliminary advice does not carry as much weight in the medical industry as its final guidance.  . Among the draft recommendations: devices with “features that make them difficult to clean will need to be disassembled in order to be completely cleaned” and “instructions/diagrams for adequate disassembly should be included in the cleaning instructions.” . The draft guidance said labels should include “any special warnings or precautions” about the reprocessing procedure. The FDA plans to release final guidance this spring. . Lengthy delays between the issuance of draft and final guidance are not uncommon at the agency, and critics say the slow process is not helping the situation. . “The draft guidance would have made a difference if it had been finalized,” said Mark Duro, director of sterile reprocessing operations at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston.  . “This was asking the manufacturers to give us more information about how to reprocess the (duodenoscopes), and every bit of additional information would be better than we have now.” . The 2011 draft guidance may also prove to be out of date as bacteria become more virulent and drug-resistant. . The FDA has known of infections linked to reusable devices since at least 2009. The draft guidance was issued partly in response to those concerns. . But the latest outbreak is novel in that the bacteria are surviving even when manufacturers instructions are followed, Maisel said. . “In 2009 we weren’t aware of outbreaks of multi-drug resistant bacteria in these scopes happening when proper cleaning was followed,” he said. . Whatever the new labels say, some experts say they won’t be enough to protect patients without additional safeguards. . “The devices need to be designed better, the instructions need to be more clear, the hospitals need better training, and adequate time needs to be given in hospitals to ensure sterility is top notch,” said Mary Logan, chief executive of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, an alliance of healthcare providers which helps develop standards for use. . AAMI will be issuing new guidelines on endoscope cleaning within the next two months. |Wed Feb 25 00:21:02 +0000 2015||Exclusive: FDA seeks to speed updates to 'superbug' device labels |5.703778991629148e+17|http://reut.rs/1DQoxgR
Frederik Joelving|(Reuters Health) - - Fabricating test results after dumping blood samples in the sink. Stitching up the cervix of pregnant women on the pretext of preventing miscarriage. Labeling healthy people as having diabetes.  . When it comes to health providers duping patients to fatten their wallets, Dr. Arun Gadre, a gynecologist-turned-health activist in India, has heard it all, and then some.  . Last year he interviewed 78 doctors from across India about the professional malpractice they’d encountered during their careers. His findings, while shocking to outsiders, were less of a surprise to Gadre.  . “I was a private gynecologist in a small town in Maharashtra in India for more than 20 years,” he told Reuters Health. “It was actually what I saw all around me.”  . Details from the interviews appeared online February 24 in the BMJ, alongside two other papers on the lack of effective regulation and whistleblower protection in India’s chaotic health sector.  . Most experts agree that healthcare fraud is rampant in the world’s largest democracy, with recent corruption scandals engulfing everyone from doctors to drug companies and health regulators.  . Gadre’s work suggests that three types of malpractice are particularly common: kickbacks for referrals, irrational drug prescribing and unnecessary interventions.  . One interviewee told Gadre that doctors typically get 30,000 to 40,000 Indian rupees (US$480-640) for referring patients for angioplasty. For perspective, many Indian health providers make less than US$10,000 a year. . Gadre said that when he started practicing, physicians referred patients to him without expecting a cut. But that changed, and he began to lose business when he refused to pay up.  . “As the medical sector became more and more commercialized, the same doctors started asking for commission and the number of patients who came to my hospital started to drop,” he says.  . While kickbacks are illegal in India, they are nearly impossible to avoid, health providers say. Young doctors in particular, many with towering student debts, find it hard to survive without them.   . Some doctors have to rely on this practice to get started, said Dr. Anita Jain, the BMJ’s India editor, adding that ultimately patients are footing the bill.  . “There is the economic burden, which is very challenging in a country like India,” she said. “But also it leads to unnecessary procedures and unnecessary investigations.” . The health sector in India is largely private, and most people pay out of pocket. A 2011 study in The Lancet found that 39 million Indians fall into poverty yearly from medical expenses. . Another theme in Gadre’s interviews is irrational drug use. He tells of a girl who received steroids for red eyes from a homeopathic health provider. She later developed cataracts, a known side effect from prolonged use, and needed surgery. . Alternative practitioners such as homeopaths and Ayurvedic healers are common in India, and many people prefer them over doctors with a diploma in modern medicine. While not allowed to use modern drugs, in practice they do so with impunity, often encouraged by drug company sales representatives. . Medical scams intended to wring money from patients also emerged as a major topic in the interviews. . In the so-called “sink test,” the doctor orders lab tests despite not suspecting any medical problems. . “Only a few of the tests are performed, and the extra blood collected is dumped in the sink,” Gadre writes. “Fabricated results are given in the normal range for all tests that were not performed. The patient pays a large sum, which is shared by the referring doctor and the pathologist.” . Other examples include unwarranted C-sections and hysterectomies, he said, or cervical stitches based on false reports suggesting a pregnant woman might miscarry. . Although India’s public health centers are known to be understaffed and dysfunctional, Gadre and many public health experts believe privatization of medical services and education is at the root of the problems. . But so far, he thinks, the medical community has been in denial. “Unless we accept that we are ill, we will not seek treatment,” he said of his profession. . The Indian Medical Association’s Secretary General Dr. Krishan Kumar Aggarwal largely dismissed the concerns over profit-driven tests and procedures as a “perception,” saying corruption is less widespread than the media would have it appear.  . “The medical profession is noble and will remain noble,” he told Reuters Health. “There are people who are corrupt, they are facing charges and they are being punished.” . Others argue that only the tip of the iceberg has emerged, as people who blow the whistle on corruption risk being fired or harassed. . “It has been challenging for doctors to speak up about it, and many have been victimized for doing so,” said Jain of the BMJ, who is also a family physician in Mumbai. . Last year, India enacted a whistle blowers protection act. But according to one of the new BMJ reports, the law has yet to be enforced and “offers no protection to those who wish to raise concerns about private sector healthcare.” . In a second BMJ report, Sunil Nandraj, a public health expert and adviser to the Indian government, says many Indian states lack appropriate laws to regulate hospitals, diagnostic centers and other healthcare facilities in the private sector. . “Right now, anybody can start up anything,” Nandraj told Reuters Health. “You can charge whatever, there is no legislation.” . The resulting free-for-all has been devastating for the country, he argues, and murky pricing has allowed kickback schemes to thrive. . While Nandraj is pushing for more and better legislation, Gadre and the organization he works for - Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Initiatives, or SATHI - have chosen a different path toward accountability. . As part of a government-supported program to improve rural health, SATHI is coordinating community-based monitoring of public health services in hamlets across Maharashtra.  . Villagers fill out report cards on the services, which are then displayed at the health centers, and also meet with health officials and other stakeholders at public hearings to discuss problems such as over-charging or staff absenteeism. . “Community monitoring is the only remedy for improving public services in general,” Gadre said. .

Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Obama administration has no way to repair the damage that would result from a Supreme Court decision against Obamacare that would make health care unaffordable for millions of Americans, a top health adviser said on Tuesday.  . The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of June on whether residents in at least 34 U.S. states are eligible for federal tax subsidies to help them buy health coverage under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 4.  . Conservative plaintiffs argue that the federal funds cannot pay for insurance in states that did not create their own health insurance exchanges and instead rely on the administration’s HealthCare.gov website. . “We know of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have no plans that would, undo the massive damage to our health care system that would be caused by an adverse decision,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell wrote in a letter to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.    . Hatch has pressed Burwell for an answer on how the government would respond to a negative court ruling.   . The government said last week that nearly 11.4 million people had purchased health insurance through HealthCare.gov and through 14 exchanges run by individual states and the District of Columbia.  . If the high court decides the subsidies are invalid, Burwell wrote, insurance would become unaffordable for millions of people, healthy people would be less likely to purchase insurance and Obamacare would no longer work in states with federal exchanges, driving up insurance costs.  . Until now, Burwell had refrained from commenting on the consequences of the case, King v. Burwell, which challenges wording in the 2010 law that says insurance would be provided through exchanges “provided by the state.” . Some Republican lawmakers say a Supreme Court ruling against the subsidies would allow them to replace Obamacare with their own healthcare reforms. . “By admitting they have no contingency plan to assist the millions that may lose subsidies, the administration confirms how the misguided law is unworkable for the American people,” said Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in a statement.  . “I’m committed to working with my Republican colleagues on how Congress can respond to help those hurt by Obamacare’s broken promises,” he said. |Tue Feb 24 23:06:50 +0000 2015||U.S. health official says no fix if Obamacare subsidies thrown out |5.703592227239608e+17|http://reut.rs/18iE1gw
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - When women who are family planning experts need to pick a birth control method for themselves, what do they generally choose? Not the same thing the average woman chooses, a new study found.  . About 42 percent of the family planning experts in the study used long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) – a choice made by only about 12 percent of women in the general population. . This doesn’t mean there’s a single correct choice for birth control, said Lisa Stern, the study’s lead author from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York City. . Women should “feel empowered to access information and the resources they need to obtain birth control that’s right for them,” Stern said. . LARCs, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and other implanted contraceptives, are highly effective at preventing pregnancy over several years, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). . IUDs are inserted into the uterus, where they release small amounts of either copper or the hormone progestin. The contraceptive skin implant, about the size of a matchstick, is inserted under the skin of the arm. IUDs and implants are about 20 times more effective than other options, including the Pill, says ACOG. . Stern and her colleagues write in the journal Contraception that female doctors are reportedly more likely than other women to choose LARCs, but birth control options have changed since most of those reports were first published. . Use of LARCs for birth control is encouraged by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which is a companion organization to ACOG. . For the new study, the researchers analyzed data from an anonymous 2013 online survey of 488 female family planning providers, ages 25 to 44, including doctors and nurses. . Overall, 331 were using a contraceptive. Of those, about 40 percent were using IUDs and about 2 percent were using implants. . In contrast, in 2011-2013, about 12 percent of U.S. women in the general population used intrauterine contraceptives and about 1 percent used implants. . The family planning providers were also more likely to use the vaginal ring and less likely to use sterilization and condoms, the researchers found. Only a handful were using patches, injections or other methods to prevent pregnancy. . “I will totally tell this to patients in the exam room,” said Dr. Katherine Greenberg, an adolescent medicine specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.  . Greenberg, who wasn’t involved in the new study, said she’s known anecdotally that providers are more likely to choose LARCs. “This gives me some numbers to tell them,” she said. . Greenberg said the results will help reassure women who are concerned about the safety of IUDs and implants.  . “These are so safe that we choose them as doctors,” she said. . Stern said another reason providers may be more likely to use IUDs and implants is that they have historically had better insurance and access, but that may be changing in the U.S. thanks to the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare. . For the most part, the ACA requires new insurance plans to cover birth control methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Those include IUDs, implants, pills and emergency contraception, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. . “There’s already been research showing there have been changes in contraceptive use patterns,” Stern said. .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Phone support can help ease postpartum depression, a small study suggests, offering an option for mothers who are unable or unwilling to seek therapy in person.  . In the study, women with postpartum depression received telephone counseling from other women who had previously suffered from the disorder and recovered. The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.   . “Postpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don’t get help because there’s a stigma and they don’t have time and it’s expensive,” said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. “Training peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.” . Particularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.  . To assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.  . The average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.  . The women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations. . By midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing. . Over the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.  . Mothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn’t have time for the phone calls.  . While all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end. . Even though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women’s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  . “It is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,” said Nonacs, who wasn’t involved in the study. “A lot of first-time moms wonder what’s normal, what’s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.”  . Because postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women’s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  . “Most people in the world have access to a telephone,” said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.” .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - - Britain will become the first nation to legalize a “three-parent” IVF technique which doctors say can prevent some inherited incurable diseases but which critics fear will effectively lead to “designer babies”. . After more than three hours of debate, lawmakers in parliament’s upper house voted on Tuesday for a change in the law to allow the treatments, echoing a positive vote in the lower house earlier this month. . The treatment, called mitochondrial transfer, is known as “three-parent” in vitro fertilization (IVF) because the babies, born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor. . Although the techniques are still at the research stage in laboratories in Britain and the United States, experts say that now legal hurdles have been overcome, Britain’s first 3-parent baby could be born as early as 2016. . Mitochondrial transfer involves intervening in the fertilization process to remove faulty mitochondrial DNA, which can cause inherited conditions such as heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. . Mitochondria act as tiny energy-generating batteries inside cells, and around 1 in 6,000 babies around the world are born with serious mitochondrial disorders. . Responding to the vote, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity commended lawmakers for a “considered and compassionate decision”. . “Families who know what it is like to care for a child with a devastating disease are the people best placed to decide whether mitochondrial donation is the right option,” he said. . Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology, hailed “a great day for UK science” and said the landmark decision “will ensure mothers who carry faulty mitochondria can have healthy children free from the devastating conditions.” . But Marcy Darnovsky, director of the campaign group The Center for Genetics and Society, called the move a “historic mistake” which turns children into biological experiments and will “forever alter the human germline”. . “The techniques ... are relatively crude and will not in and of themselves create so-called designer babies,” she said.  . “However, they will result in children with DNA from three different people in every cell of their bodies, which will impact a large range of traits in unknowable ways and introduce genetic changes that will be passed down to future generations.” |Tue Feb 24 21:40:57 +0000 2015||Britain becomes first nation to legalize three-parent babies |5.703376128896164e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gq5c41
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Gay men at high risk of HIV who took a daily dose of a Gilead AIDS drug as a preventative measure cut their risk of infection by 86 percent, according to results of a British trial released on Tuesday. . Researchers who conducted the trial of so-called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) said the results offer real hope of reversing the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men, one of the highest risk groups. . “These results ... show PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection in the real world,” said Sheena McCormack, a professor of clinical epidemiology at University College London and the study’s lead investigator. . PrEP involves people who do not have HIV but who are at high risk of becoming infected and seek to protect themselves by taking a single pill, usually a combination of two antiretrovirals, every day.  . Some 35.3 million people worldwide have HIV. AIDS experts estimate that globally, new HIV infections among gay men could by reduced by 20 to 25 percent through PrEP — averting up to a million new infections in this group over 10 years. . The drug used in the UK trial — Gilead’s anti-retroviral Truvada — was known to reduce new HIV infections in placebo-controlled trials, but researchers wanted to see if similar success could be achieved in a “real world” context. . Some 545 men were enrolled at 13 sexual health clinics across England and randomized to receive PrEP immediately or after a period of 12 months, allowing researchers to compare those on PrEP versus those not yet on PrEP. . The results, presented on Tuesday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle in the United States, showed there were 22 HIV infections among participants in the first year — three in the immediate group and 19 in the deferred group. . The researchers said the 86 percent protection is the best reported from a randomized controlled PrEP trial to date. . In a second PrEP trial also presented at CROI, French researchers enrolled 450 high-risk gay men and gave half a placebo and asked the others to take four tablets of the AIDS drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine, two before and two after sex.  . Their results showed men in the active pill group were also 86 percent less likely to become infected with HIV.  . Michel Sidibe, executive director of the United Nations AIDS agency UNAIDS said these “timely and important” findings would “advance global efforts to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030”. . “These new results are a significant breakthrough in advancing efforts to provide effective HIV prevention options,” he said in a statement. |Tue Feb 24 20:53:45 +0000 2015||Preventative treatment dramatically reduces HIV risk in gay men |5.703257313283359e+17|http://reut.rs/1DPuBpD

Susan Heavey|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it still could not approve two sunscreen ingredients for use in the United States despite years of review, citing a lack of data to support their safety and effectiveness. . The additives, ecamsule and enzacamene, are to protect the skin against cancer-causing ultra-violet (UV) rays. In January, the FDA reached a similar conclusion on six other ingredients that had been pending approval.  . FDA staff have been reviewing sunscreen ingredients for more than a decade. That process was to be streamlined with passage of the Sunscreen Innovation Act in November 2014. . The agency’s decision is a blow to manufacturers who want to expand over-the-counter sunscreen products for U.S. consumers.  . “Americans are not going to have access to the innovative sunscreens that have been available, in some cases for decades, all over the world,” said Michael Werner, a lawyer and policy adviser to the Public Access to SunScreens (PASS) Coalition.  . Theresa Michele, head of nonprescription drug products at the FDA, wrote in a blog post that there was not enough data on the long-term effects of the ingredients and how much was absorbed into the skin, among other information.     . Despite the effort to speed up the process, products must meet the agency’s standards, Michele wrote.   . L’Oreal applied for review of ecamsule in 2007 and Buchanan Ingersoll sought a review of enzacamene in 2002 on behalf of Merck & Co Inc, whose consumer business is now owned by Bayer AG.  . European regulators have approved products for skin protection containing other UV filters that dermatologists and others in the industry have said offer better protection.  . It could take years for companies to provide the FDA the kind of data it wants, Werner said. |Tue Feb 24 20:17:41 +0000 2015||U.S. FDA wants more data on sunscreen additives before approval |5.703166545608499e+17|http://reut.rs/1DPlXaJ
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - An experimental therapeutic vaccine from Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic helped significantly extend survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer, according to results of a small early-stage trial conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute.  . Shares of Bavarian Nordic closed up almost 12 percent in Copenhagen after the company released the data on Tuesday. . The study involved 30 patients with prostate cancer that had failed to benefit from standard treatments that reduce levels of testosterone, the male hormone that fuels the cancer.  . Patients were treated with the company’s Prostvac vaccine, in addition to escalating doses of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Yervoy, an approved injectable treatment for advanced melanoma that works by taking the brakes off the body’s immune system. . On average, patients taking both drugs survived 31.3 months, compared with a predicted survival period of 18.5 months that had been based on historical survival data for older chemotherapy treatments. . Among the 15 patients who received the highest 10 milligram dose of Yervoy in combination with Prostvac, 20 percent remained alive at 80 months. . Data from the combination trial were especially impressive, considering that Yervoy had previously failed in Bristol-Myers’ own trials to prolong survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer. . Yervoy and an emerging group of immuno-oncology drugs called PD-1 inhibitors from Bristol-Myers, Merck & Co and other drugmakers are expected to have greatest effectiveness when used in combination. The PD1-inhibitors make cancer cells more visible to the immune system, removing their natural camouflage.  . Complete data from the Prostvac study are slated to be presented on Thursday at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in Orlando. . The vaccine is designed to trigger an immune system response against prostate cancer cells. |Tue Feb 24 20:01:58 +0000 2015||Bavarian Nordic vaccine helps prolong life in prostate cancer trial |5.703126992315351e+17|http://reut.rs/1GpHSmY
|LONDON (Reuters) - British doctors called on Tuesday for Roche’s cancer drug Avastin to be made routinely available as a cheap alternative for treating people with a debilitating eye disorder. . Doctors from 120 Clinical Commissioning Groups said using Avastin ‘off-label’ to treat the potentially blinding condition of wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) could save the National Health Service (NHS) 102 million pounds ($158 million) a year. . Avastin costs about 60 pounds when used for eye injections, far less than Lucentis, which is specifically licensed for wet AMD and is priced at about 700 pounds. . “As clinicians, we are seeing an increase in the incidence of this chronic eye condition due to an aging population, and as commissioners we have a responsibility to ensure that every pound spent is done so to the best effect,” Dr Amanda Doyle, co-chair of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said in a statement. . Although Avastin is not licensed for AMD, it works in a similar way to Lucentis, which is marketed in Europe by Novartis. The British doctors said current regulations made it hard for physicians to prescribe Avastin. . Novartis and Roche have always discouraged the substitution of Avastin for Lucentis, arguing that the two drugs were developed for different therapeutic purposes and Lucentis is a safer option. . The issue of whether Avastin should be used as a cheap alternative has long been controversial in Europe. Last year in Italy, Roche and Novartis were accused of collusion in trying to impose the use of Lucentis in AMD - a charge the two companies have denied. |Tue Feb 24 20:01:57 +0000 2015||UK doctors urge use of Roche's Avastin as cheap eye drug |5.7031269682817434e+17|http://reut.rs/1DPhQeR
Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) - - When Stacey Whiteman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis two years ago, she didn’t realize the toughest challenge would be its impact on her brain. The 53-year-old from Massachusetts was forced to quit work as an executive assistant after becoming easily confused and prone to forget, even about priorities like doctor appointments. . When her physician suggested OpenNotes, an electronic portal allowing patients full access to their medical records, including doctors’ notes, Whiteman was eager to log on.   . “For somebody like me who has a hard time processing things, I need this convenience,” she said. Whiteman now refers to OpenNotes daily, to review what happened during appointments, be reminded of future ones and check lab results.  . Patient access to physician notes, historically rare, has led to more collaborative doctor-patient relationships and more engaged health care consumers, according to a new paper online February 10 in the British Medical Journal.   . “Regardless of one’s competence, health information is often quite opaque,” said coauthor Michael Meltsner, a professor at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston.  . Meltsner and his two coauthors, Dr. Tom Delbanco and Jan Walker, both at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, evaluated data on 19,000 patients and 105 primary care physicians using OpenNotes at three U.S. hospitals.  . After one year, 99% of patients wanted to continue accessing notes. Despite initial concerns among physicians about additional work, none decided to discontinue use.  . “It’s like oysters. Once you like oysters, you hang in there with them,” Delbanco said. “But it’s an acquired taste.” . According to the paper, patients described “a new understanding of the importance of medications and more motivation to adhere to treatment.” They shared notes with caregivers and “reminded harried doctors about follow-up that had not been completed.”  . The participating institutions, Beth Israel Deaconess, Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, and Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center, have since expanded OpenNotes use throughout specialty and primary care. Overall, five million Americans now have access to notes, up from 20,000 two years ago. . Delbanco predicts access will soon be common nationwide. Electronic medical record software suppliers, such as Epic, are building note access into products. Health institutions may opt for or against activation.  . The most surprising finding, Delbanco said, is that elderly patients and those with little education were as interested in reading notes as the young and well educated.  . “We thought this would be a yuppie internet,” he said. However, at Harborview, a safety-net institution, patients read online notes by logging on to computers at public libraries and hospital kiosks.  . “Patients have a right to information about themselves and the right to be told the truth,” said bioethicist Nancy Berlinger of The Hastings Center.  . Note sharing can be particularly beneficial for patients with serious conditions like cancer, Berlinger said, as emotions are often high during appointments in which multiple issues are addressed and treatment plans formulated.   . “A lot of these patients’ lives are happening outside of the clinic,” Berlinger said. “People can take in information in the privacy of their own homes.”  . Berlinger said she questions how usable OpenNotes would be for non-English speaking patients and for those with dementia. . According to Delbanco, OpenNotes is like a new medicine, good for some and contraindicated in others. “Every medicine is designed to help some people, and OpenNotes is no exception,” he said.  . Rita Charon, an internist and director of the program in narrative medicine at Columbia University in New York City, said any program opening the flow of information between clinicians and patients is beneficial.  . “It’s easy to do, and something many of us do routinely,” Charon said. “It lets the patient know what I think, and it reminds me to write in English and not in abbreviations. It reminds me to faithfully repeat what happened in that twenty minutes.”  . Measuring outcomes, she said, would help note-sharing practices to spread.  . “This work has helped us see the important feasibility parts, that patients will put time into reading what we write, and that it does something,” Charon said. “Now we have to ask what does it do?” . Delbanco acknowledges that health outcomes are still unknown and difficult to evaluate.  . However, he said, “We know that engaged patients have better outcomes.”  .

It would be a problem,” he said in the capital Monrovia, where he spent his self-imposed exile, afraid that he could still infect her through sexual contact despite his clean bill of health. . Research has shown traces of Ebola in semen of some survivors for at least 82 days after the onset of symptoms and in vaginal secretions for a much shorter period. . Scientists say testes are a reservoir for Ebola because white blood cells, which protect the body against disease, are unable to effectively destroy the virus there. . Although there is no conclusive scientific proof these traces are infectious, anecdotal evidence of several cases in West Africa and confirmed transmission of Marburg, another viral hemorrhagic fever, have led experts to warn of the potential risk of sexually transmitted Ebola.     . With the disease typically taking 15 to 21 days to run its course, this means traces of Ebola can remain in semen for around two months after recovery. . This has raised the prospect of new infections, even in areas free of the disease, just as the year-long epidemic appears to be receding across the region.  . Health officials declare Ebola outbreaks officially over after countries complete 42 days — twice the incubation period for Ebola — without recording new infections. . “We are saying that the outbreak is over after 42 days but  technically it could be longer because of the risk of sexual transmission through contaminated semen,” said Philippe Maughan, at the humanitarian branch of the European Commission. . The World Health Organization (WHO) advises Ebola survivors to abstain from sex during a 90-day period following recovery, or, failing that, to practice safe sex. . Worries over sexual transmission risk adding to the stigmatization Ebola survivors already face, and are protracting the emotional burden of families often struggling to overcome the deaths of relatives.  . While men like Pabai have taken the WHO’s advice a step further by separating themselves from their loved ones, some traumatized communities have imposed more draconian measures. . “We’ve got people being treated horrendously,” said Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman on Ebola for the WHO. “In Sierra Leone particularly male survivors have been put in a form of concentration camp.”     . Harris said men had been detained in Bombali, a district northeast of the capital Freetown, highlighting how public hysteria had become a real danger.  . “This will further stigmatize anyone with symptoms of Ebola and is likely to drive infections underground just at a time when we’re getting the upper hand,” she said. . Infections are now receding, potentially freeing up resources to test the semen of male survivors for the virus.  . A positive test result would still not confirm if the traces of Ebola remain infectious, but a negative result could bring welcome relief. . “It’s entirely possible to do this,” said Michel Van Herp, an epidemiologist with medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres. “At least we could reassure an individual that his semen is negative and he is not contagious.”  . Late last week Musa Pabai finally went home to Walakor, his village just outside Monrovia. He flirted, somewhat hesitantly, with Hannah but still worried for her health.   . “They told me three months (of abstinence), but I am going to make it five months,” he said. “That’s my decision.” |Tue Feb 24 18:16:01 +0000 2015||Fear of Ebola's sexual transmission drives abstinence, panic |5.7028603943419085e+17|http://reut.rs/1GpmAWK
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - For people taking drugs to prevent blood clots after a heart attack, adding pain relievers like ibuprofen may lead to bleeding, stroke or another heart attack, according to a new study. . Anyone who has had a heart attack should be prescribed both aspirin and clopidogrel, blood thinners that make platelets less sticky and reduce the risk of clots and a second heart attack, said lead author Dr. Anne-Marie Schjerning Olsen, of Copenhagen University Hospital Gentofte, Hellerup, Denmark. . But ibuprofen and other so-called NSAIDs also thin the blood.  . NSAID (pronounced “ensaid”) stands for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to Olsen’s results, adding an NSAID to the mix is dangerous. . Even taking an NSAID for less than a week was associated with an increased risk of bleeding and a second heart attack, Olsen told Reuters Health by email. . “There has been a tendency to think that short-term use of NSAIDs is safe. Our study suggests this is not the case and that even a few days of use is associated with increased risks of both bleeding and cardiac events, mainly heart attacks,” she said.  . “Furthermore I was surprised that despite guidelines which discourage use of NSAIDs in patients with cardiovascular disease, one third of our population had at least one prescription for NSAIDs,” she said. . Using nationwide registries in Denmark from 2002 to 2011, the researchers examined records for more than 60,000 adults who survived at least a month after hospitalization for a heart attack. Over the course of the study, 34 percent of patients filled a prescription for an NSAID like ibuprofen or naproxen, designed to treat pain and inflammation, while they were taking anti-clotting drugs. . Three and a half years after their heart attacks, nearly a third of the group had died. More than 5,000 heart attack survivors suffered a bleeding event in the brain, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system or any other site, and 799 died as a result.  . People who filled a prescription for an NSAID while taking other anti-clotting drugs were about twice as likely to suffer a bleeding event as those who were not taking NSAIDs, according to results in JAMA.  . Those taking NSAIDs were also more likely to suffer a stroke, second heart attack or to die of a heart event than others. . All NSAIDs, whether prescription or over-the-counter, increase the risk of bleeding, especially gastrointestinal bleeding, Olsen said. “Some NSAIDs, for example diclofenac, are also associated with a small increase in the risk of heart attack,” she said. . Many people in this study were taking NSAIDs, so more patient and physician education is needed about the risks for people on anti-clotting medications, said Dr. Charles L. Campbell of the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, who co-wrote an editorial on the new results.  . “Additionally, it appears some patients experienced bad outcomes following very short exposures to NSAIDS,” Campbell told Reuters Health by email. “I think many of us have assumed long term exposure was worrisome but that we could ‘get away’ with short term use.” . Even if bleeding isn’t fatal, patients will have to suspend all medications for a time, leaving them unprotected from a second heart attack, Campbell noted. . “NSAIDs were used a lot by the patients in this study – pain is a common problem and can cause great suffering,” Olsen said. “People may be happy to take these risks to have relief from pain but it is very important that they are aware of the risks and can make an informed decision about taking NSAIDs for pain relief.” . Only additional randomized trials can establish definitively that the NSAIDs caused the increased risk of bleeding and heart attack, but until then, “if NSAIDs are needed, physicians should consider the balance of risks and benefit and exercise great caution even for short-term treatment and ensure that this has been discussed with patients,” Olsen said. .

Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - A cholera outbreak is feared in coming months in Syria, where other water-borne diseases such as hepatitis A and typhoid are on the rise due to poor sanitation, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Tuesday. . Safe drinking water is available at about one-third of the level it was before the conflict erupted nearly five years ago, and supplies are cut-off to punish civilians at times, it said. . Some 31,460 cases of hepatitis A were reported in Syria last year and more than 1,000 cases have been recorded per week since January, said Dr. Elizabeth Hoff, WHO representative in Syria. . “This normally we see when the weather is warmer and so on. But it just tells you people no longer have the same access to safe drinking water as before,” Hoff told a news briefing.  . “Going into the warmer season, what we are particularly concerned about ... is cholera, this is our main fear, but so far we haven’t seen it. . “But quite clearly the situation is going much more critical,” she added. “Water has been used for political dividends and has been turned off to certain areas and that leads people to drink water from unsafe areas,”  . Cholera, an intestinal infection often linked to contaminated drinking water, causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, leaving small children especially vulnerable to death from dehydration, according to the U.N. health agency. . Infectious diseases thrive in overcrowded conditions and poor hygiene. The WHO appealed for $116 million to provide medicines and health care services to 12.2 million people across Syria this year. . Some 25,000 people are wounded each month, requiring surgical supplies, safe blood transfusion and anesthetics, it said. On Sunday, WHO delivered critical medicines and supplies to the eastern part of Aleppo. . More than 2.7 million people live in areas controlled by the Islamic State, whose forces have sought some medicines from the WHO through non-governmental organizations, although the Syrian Arab Red Crescent delivers more aid, Hoff said. . A further 4.8 million reside in hard-to-reach areas which are inaccessible due to fighting, she said. . “We are moving towards a worse situation and some of the areas going back to being besieged. Here I would like to mention for example Deir al-Zor city, this is now government-controlled but being besieged, with a population of 150,000,” Hoff said. . Moadimiya, a Damascus suburb with 35,000 people, and Mharda, a government-held town of 10,000 in Hama province, are now considered besieged, she said.  |Tue Feb 24 17:39:59 +0000 2015||Cholera feared in Syria due to dirty water, WHO warns |5.7027696781315686e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gpgs0H
Daniel Gaitan|(Reuters Health) - Due to an unexpected federal policy reversal sought by advocates for nearly 10 years, schools could start billing Medicaid for health services such as asthma screenings, vaccinations and care for chronic diseases provided to some low-income students. . “Clearing away the obstacle was a first step, but the next step is educating the public about it,” said Ed Walz, vice president of communications with the First Focus Campaign for Children, a nonprofit children’s advocacy organization.  . According to a 1997 rule by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), known as the “free care rule,” if schools provided a service to the public for free, the schools couldn’t ask Medicaid to pay for that service when provided to a Medicaid-eligible student – even if Medicaid would pay for the service if provided in a medical setting. Exceptions were allowed for some children with disabilities.  . For example, if a school provided free asthma screenings to all students, the school couldn’t ask Medicaid to reimburse for screening Medicaid-eligible students, even though screenings would be covered in a hospital, said Mary-Beth Malcarney, assistant research professor with George Washington University’s Department of Health Policy. . Districts could circumvent the rule by charging all children for the services. That approach, however, placed a burden on low-income families not enrolled in Medicaid who may not be able to afford even nominal fees. . “It does sound very wonky, but it certainly has a big impact on students and schools across the country,” Malcarney told Reuters Health. “Because of the rule, schools shied away from offering many services. It also impacted the ability of low-income schools to hire health care staff, because they could not receive funding from Medicaid.” . In 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services Departmental Appeals Board struck down the rule, concluding that it had no basis in federal law. In 2013, a California court also rejected the policy. But the issue remained cloudy.  . Last December, CMS finally reversed the “free care rule” in a State Medicaid Directors Letter aiming to help remove “any ambiguity” about the policy. (The letter is available here: . ) . CMS declined to comment despite repeated requests.  . Malcarney said she believes it will take months or years for districts to begin providing more health services.  . “I can see some in the education field saying, ‘That’s great that the rule changed and maybe we can now seek some Medicaid reimbursement, but we don’t have personnel or the administrative capacity to do all this,’” she added. “Districts may need some start-up resources. There is a long road ahead.” . Further complicating the changes are dozens of state laws addressing the “free care rule” that remain in effect. Some states prohibit schools from being reimbursed by Medicaid. . Craig Garthwaite, an assistant professor of management and strategy at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in Chicago, said he believes lower income districts will benefit from the policy reversal. . “This frees schools, particularly those in low-income communities, to offer more primary care and preventative service through their health centers,” he told Reuters Health. “Schools will have to look at their budget and see if they will get reimbursed for services. It’s not like this is a costless thing for districts, because Medicaid reimbursement rates are not particularly high. We shouldn’t expect all states and schools to react similarly.”|Tue Feb 24 17:39:58 +0000 2015||Rule reversal allows schools to bill Medicaid for services |5.702769656069407e+17|http://reut.rs/1DOLS2h
Karin Strohecker|LONDON (Reuters) - Sierra Leone could see growth rebound to double digits over the next 3-5 years as it emerges from the Ebola crisis and plans to tap its diaspora to raise funds for development, its foreign minister said.  . The west African country’s economy was ravaged by the recent year-long outbreak of the Ebola virus that killed more than 9,000 people across Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Its key mining and agricultural sectors were decimated and local trade and international transport ground to a halt. . “At the moment because of Ebola, we are back in the single digits, but we will get back up again ... we will get back into the double digits,” Foreign Minister Samura Kamara told Reuters on the sidelines of an investor meeting in London. . Before the Ebola outbreak, the government forecast that 2014 gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by 11.5 percent. The World Bank now expects 4 percent for 2014 and -2.0 percent this year. . Much of the recent growth has been driven by the mining sector, which makes up 16 percent of GDP and had taken a double hit from the virus outbreak and the drop in commodity prices. . Looking ahead, Kamara said growth would be fueled by small businesses and farming returning to normal as trade and travel restrictions are lifted. He also saw a recovery in mining,  albeit a challenging one given the slower demand and lower prices. . He added that Sierra Leone could also enlist its countrymen living abroad to help raise funds to rebuild the country, though more effort was needed to lay the groundwork. . “(By) 2018, hopefully we should be able to issue diaspora bonds,” he said. . Speaking ahead of an international conference in March focusing on rebuilding the three west African countries, Kamara said rebuilding efforts should be centered around consolidating the healthcare sector, which had been on its knees even before the outbreak, and boosting education. . “In the healthcare sector, we need to preserve knowledge, but also equipment,” he said.  . Kamara, one of eight candidates short-listed to become the next president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), said he would focus the organization’s efforts on boosting infrastructure development and regional integration. . The new AfDB president will be elected by its board of governors on May 28 and take over from Rwandan national Donald Kaberuka, who has been in office since 2005. |Tue Feb 24 16:32:41 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone hopes for economic bounce post-Ebola |5.7026003358755226e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gp43cZ
Misha Hussain|GUECKEDOU, Guinea (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lying in an Ebola treatment center in southeast Guinea, hidden behind thick plastic sheets and surrounded by nurses in yellow protective suits, Rose Komano feared she would not survive the virus that had robbed her of so many loved ones. . “Everyone before me had died, I was terrified,” Komano recalled. . But the 18-year-old became the first person to beat Ebola in the region of Gueckedou, where the latest outbreak of the disease was initially detected in March 2014. . Almost a year after she was released from a treatment center run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Komano, who contracted the virus while caring for her sick grandmother, still mourns the deaths of her relatives. . “I lost 19 members of my family, including my grandmother and mother, to Ebola in the first few months of the outbreak. Nobody had heard of Ebola back then,” said Komano, who was first interviewed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation a year ago. . Ebola has infected more than 23,000 people in West Africa and killed over 9,000, nearly all in worst-hit Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is transmitted through blood, vomit, diarrhea and other bodily fluids. . Early treatment for Komano resulted in a full recovery, at a time when the virus was thought to kill 90 percent of its victims, according to the World Health Organization. In December, around 57 percent of Ebola victims died, the WHO said. . Despite a clean bill of health, there was still a long road ahead for Komano. . As infection rates accelerated throughout the region, fear and panic set in. Health workers responsible for Komano’s reintegration into her community were afraid she might be shunned because of the virus. . Now, making an omelet for breakfast on a small wood fire outside her mud-brick home in the Farako 2 quarter of Gueckedou, Komano says she feels very lucky to have had such good support when she came home. . “Since I returned we have eaten together, we’ve worked together, we’ve done everything together. I’m in great shape and I’m very happy to be back with my family and friends,” she said. . In the capital Conakry, survivor Dore Zorobo had no such luck when he and six colleagues were infected by a sick woman from Sierra Leone seeking treatment at Donka hospital, where he worked as a lab technician on blood samples. . “Ebola turned my life upside down,” said Zorobo, 32, from Lola in southeast Guinea, who was infected through a small cut on his hand in June. . At that time, medics were not testing for the Ebola virus,  so screening for the usual diseases came back negative. Zorobo was prescribed painkillers and told to rest at home, where his younger brother took care of him. . Days later, they were both in the Ebola treatment center in Donka Hospital with the initial symptoms of the virus: extreme tiredness, fever, headache, diarrhea and vomiting. Lab tests confirmed they had the same disease as the woman. . But the hardest part was still to come. . “I watched my brother die in front of me, but I survived,” said Zorobo. . Soon after, his colleagues, friends and even family began to disown him for fear of catching the virus. . “Ebola is hard to explain, so my family insulted me when I called to tell them what had happened. My friends avoided me, and even my colleagues, who all used to eat together round one table at work, left me to sit alone,” Zorobo said. . Like many survivors, Zorobo has used his experience and turned it into something positive. . He now works for MSF. When medical teams pick up patients, his job is to explain to the patients, their relatives and neighbors what is happening. . Back in Gueckedou, Komano is also doing her part by speaking on radio shows to persuade suspicious communities to report to a treatment center if they show symptoms and to accept survivors. . “It’s slowly changing. At first people thought that MSF and the Red Cross were here to kill us, but now they see it’s the virus,” said Komano. |Tue Feb 24 14:26:12 +0000 2015||First Ebola survivors talk of hope and despair in Guinea |5.702282014919598e+17|http://reut.rs/1EroFSM
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - More than 80 percent of cases of a certain E. coli illness were linked to beef and vegetables grown in rows, according to a U.S. government report on Tuesday. . Salmonella infections were traced to a wider variety of foods ranging from tomatoes and sprouts to chicken, beef and pork, the report released on Tuesday by three federal agencies charged with food safety showed. . The report produced by the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration is a partnership of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the first time the three federal agencies charged with food safety are using a single method to estimate sources of foodborne illnesses. . The report comes amid calls to for a single food safety agency, as proposed in President Barack Obama’s 2016 federal budget plan. It is also outlined in a bill by Illinois Democratic Senator Richard Durbin and Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut. . The report used data from nearly 1,000 outbreaks between 1998 and 2012 to find foods responsible for illness from four major foodborne bacteria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157 (E. coli O157), Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter. . According to CDC estimates, these four pathogens cause 1.9 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States each year. . Researchers broke down the outbreaks into 17 categories of foods. They found just two food categories accounted for most illnesses caused by Campylobacter, E. coli O157, and Listeria, but seven categories accounted for a similar percentage of Salmonella illnesses. . Of the findings, 74 percent of Campylobacter illnesses were caused by dairy (66 percent) or chicken (8 percent), 82 percent of E. coli O157 illnesses were caused by beef (46 percent) or vegetables grown in rows (36 percent), and 81 percent of Listeria illnesses were caused by either fruits (50 percent) or dairy (31 percent). . With salmonella, the range was broader, with 77 percent of illnesses attributed to vegetables grown from seeds (18 percent), eggs (12 percent), fruits (12 percent), chicken (10 percent), sprouts (8 percent), beef (9 percent), and pork (8 percent). . Dr. Chris Braden of CDC’s Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases, said a single methodology allows  agencies to better coordinate their efforts. “We can do more as a group than we can individually.” |Tue Feb 24 13:30:00 +0000 2015||U.S. government report outlines foods most prone to pathogens |5.702140584499036e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gou4sV
Alistair Bell|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A large majority of Americans favor mandatory vaccinations of children, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday, apparently unswayed by some senior Republicans who have raised fears the medical shots could lead to autism. . Seventy-eight percent of respondents in the online survey said all children should be vaccinated unless there is a direct health risk to them from vaccination. . Only 13 percent opposed vaccinations.   . “The numbers are absolutely overwhelming in favor of vaccinations with a consistent minority in opposition,” said Ipsos pollster Julia Clarke. . Republican Senator Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist and potential 2016 presidential candidate, this month revived a long-running controversy over vaccinations when he said he had heard of instances where vaccines caused mental disorders. . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another possible Republican presidential hopeful, said parents needed a “measure of choice.” But his spokesman later said the governor believed kids should be vaccinated against measles.      . The disease was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, but a measles outbreak that began in California in December has shone a spotlight on an anti-vaccination movement based mostly in California and the Pacific Northwest.     . Theories of a link between vaccines and autism have led some parents to refuse to have their children inoculated, even after those theories have been debunked.  . The Reuters-Ipsos poll showed the number of people opposed to vaccinations was significantly higher in the Far West, at 17 percent, than anywhere else in the country.      . “It’s to do with the no-vaccination movement possibly originating there like an epicenter,” Clarke said. . The data also suggests support for not vaccinating children “does appear to be correlated with what I’d call libertarian or anti-authority tendencies and sentiment,” Clarke said. That support tends to be from people who lean more toward the Republican or Tea Party but are much more likely to identify themselves as independent, she said.    . Older people are clearly more supportive of vaccinations than younger people, the survey showed. . Overall, 71 percent of Americans think public schools should be allowed to suspend unvaccinated children when there is a major disease outbreak.  . Forty-two percent said a politician’s position on vaccinations would have a major impact on whether they voted for him or her. Thirty-five percent said it would not. . Asked whether parents should be allowed to choose whether to vaccinate their children, 38 percent backed that idea while 44 percent opposed it.     . A sample of 6,012 Americans over 18 years old were interviewed online for the survey between February 4-23.   . The precision of Reuters/Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. |Tue Feb 24 12:26:46 +0000 2015||Big U.S. majority favors mandatory vaccinations: Reuters/Ipsos poll |5.701981448075182e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gojtyj
Rosmi Shaji|(Reuters) - CymaBay Therapeutics Inc said its experimental gout drug did not reduce uric acid levels better than the current standard of care, reducing chances of developing the company’s lead drug as a standalone therapy. . The company’s shares fell as much as 25 percent to $9.19 in afternoon trade, making it one of the top percentage losers on the Nasdaq. . CymaBay said two doses of its drug, arhalofenate, did not cut uric acid levels to below 6 mg for every deciliter in a mid-stage study, compared with the standard of care treatment, allopurinol. . “It tends to indicate that we will have a hard time chasing patients that are satisfied with the uric acid lowering of allopurinol,” Chief Executive Harold Van Wart said on a call with analysts. . He attributed the lower-than-expected fall in uric acid levels to changes to data from patients not following the study design. . The company said it was considering monotherapy and combination therapy for its late-stage study design. . CymaBay said on Jan.12 that arhalofenate in combination with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s febuxostat lowered serum uric acid levels, compared with placebo in an earlier mid-stage study. . Gout is a condition affecting joints and muscles when the body acts against a build-up of uric acid in the blood. . Described as a painful and common form of inflammatory arthritis, gout affects nearly 8.3 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing data. . CymaBay said on Tuesday its once-a-day drug was shown to be safe and well tolerated in the mid-stage study. . This is the first study to show that arhalofenate produces reductions in flares without concomitant dosing of colchicine, the main goal of the study. . Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory compound commonly prescribed to treat gout. The compound has been available in the United States for more than half a century in injectable form. . Intravenous form of colchicine has been ordered off the market by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because of toxicities and fatalities. . Oral versions of the compound are allowed to be sold to treat gout as the side effects are mostly nausea, diarrhea and stomach pain. . Shares of the company, which went public in July 2014, was down about 18 percent at $10.05. |Tue Feb 24 11:53:05 +0000 2015||CymaBay's gout drug meets main goal in mid-stage study |5.7018967153750426e+17|http://reut.rs/1EqYvjf
Steve Quinn|JUNEAU, Alaska (Reuters) - Smoking, growing and owning small amounts of marijuana became legal in Alaska on Tuesday as a growing decriminalization movement reached the United States’ northwest frontier. . Alaska, which narrowly passed the measure in November, followed Colorado and Washington among states allowing recreational use, reflecting a rapidly shifting legal landscape for the drug.  . It remains illegal, however, under federal law. . In the District of Columbia, Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Tuesday the U.S. capital would go ahead with legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana and pot plants despite opposition from Congress. Voters overwhelmingly approved legalizing pot last year, but its sale is still banned. . Oregon voters approved a similar measure in November, but the drug does not become legal until July. In Maryland, the state legislature began hearings on Tuesday on a measure to legalize marijuana. . In Alaska, anyone aged 21 or older can possess up to an ounce (28.3 grams) of marijuana and can grow up to six plants, three of which can be flowering. . Smoking in public and buying and selling the drug remains illegal, but private exchanges are allowed if money is not involved. . President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice has allowed the experiments to proceed, saying it would look to prosecute a narrower range of marijuana-related crimes, such as sales to children.  . But that could change if a more conservative president is elected in 2016, when Alaska’s first marijuana shops are likely to open. . Supporters of the measure say it reflects a sense of personal freedom that resonates with residents of Alaska, a state with a libertarian streak. They also say legal sales will generate income and jobs. . “Alaska now has some of the most sensible marijuana laws in the nation,” Dr. Tim Hinterberger, chairman of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, said in a statement. . The state’s alcohol regulatory board, which is set to meet on Tuesday, and other officials must still fill gaps in the legislation, such as a definition of the public places where people cannot light up.  . State regulators are drafting rules covering the taxation and sale of marijuana and which must be adopted by Nov. 24. Applications for the first business licenses will not be accepted until February 2016. . Police have released regular updates on how they will enforce the law. |Tue Feb 24 11:32:51 +0000 2015||Alaska allows recreational marijuana as campaign spreads |5.70184576653525e+17|http://reut.rs/1EqVjnJ
Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Major League Baseball players would be banned from using chewing tobacco at games in California under a bill expected to be introduced in the state legislature on Tuesday, the first in a nationwide campaign planned by anti-tobacco activists. . The bill targets baseball’s ubiquitous habit less than a year after retired San Diego Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn died of cancer of the salivary glands, believed related to chewing tobacco or “dipping” it by lodging it between the lip and the gum. . “Tony Gwynn was somebody I thought was a spokesman for baseball, a great role model as a person,” said Assembly member Tony Thurmond, a Democrat who represents Richmond and other suburbs east of San Francisco and the bill’s author.  . “I’m hopeful that this bill will lend to his legacy, that it will help to prevent illness for young people and young athletes.”     . Smoking is already banned in Major League Baseball, and the minor leagues have prohibited dipping and chewing, although some say the minor league rules are not strictly enforced. Major League Baseball strongly discourages the use of smokeless tobacco, but has not banned it. . Thurmond’s bill would ban use of all tobacco products at baseball stadiums in the state, including dipping, chewing, smoking or using electronic or e-cigarettes. It would also require baseball stadiums to post signs announcing the ban in all dugouts, bullpens, locker rooms, bathrooms and at all entrances. . A spokesman for Major League Baseball did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. . Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said chewing tobacco is not only deadly for adults like Gwynn, but it is increasingly popular with teens and boys seeking to emulate their baseball heroes. . “The use of smokeless tobacco has actually increased among kids,” Myers said, “because young fans idolize and imitate Major League Baseball players.” . Myers’s organization is backing Thurmond’s bill, and hopes to carry the campaign to other states if it is successful in California. . Other baseball greats have also battled cancer believed linked to chewing tobacco.

|LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co has contributed an HIV medicine for children to an international shared patent pool in a move that should speed the development of cheap pediatric formulations for use in poor countries. . The non-profit Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), which aims to persuade leading drug companies to share rights to their products with generic manufacturers, said on Tuesday the deal for Merck’s raltegravir would add to the treatment arsenal. . Merck has not previously participated in the scheme. The MPP has signed deals with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Roche and ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline. . Two months ago, MPP signed a license with AbbVie for pediatric versions of two other HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir. . The licensing agreement with Merck means other companies can use raltegravir in pediatric medicines sold in low- and middle-income countries where 98 percent of children with HIV live.  |Tue Feb 24 08:28:08 +0000 2015||Merck places children's HIV drug in shared non-profit patent pool |5.701380939085988e+17|http://reut.rs/1Eqs3xx
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California public health officials on Monday reported four new cases of measles, bringing the total number people infected in the state so far to 123, most of them linked to an outbreak that began at Disneyland in December. . But the latest report from the California Department of Public Health shows only one person diagnosed with the virus in Contra Costa County, where authorities warned commuters earlier this month that a LinkedIn employee rode Bay Area Rapid Transit System for three days while contagious. . All told, more than 150 people across the United States have recently been diagnosed with the disease.  . According to the California health department, 39 of the 123 people who contracted measles in the state were believed to have been exposed while visiting Disneyland. An additional 36 had contacts with those people in a household or community setting. . The state health department said 46 other cases had an unknown exposure source but were presumed linked to the Disneyland outbreak. . A senior California health official has said the source of the outbreak may never be identified, despite a finding that the same strain of virus had led to a wave of illness in the Philippines. . That same genotype has been detected in at least 14 countries and six other U.S. states in the past six months. . The Disneyland resort in Anaheim receives millions of visitors a year, many of them from overseas. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines that are fueled by now debunked research suggesting a link to autism have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014, the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks.  But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Tue Feb 24 00:48:38 +0000 2015||California reports four more measles cases in Disneyland outbreak |5.700224566201426e+17|http://reut.rs/1GmMYAE
Emma Farge|DAKAR (Reuters) - A Japanese anti-Ebola drug being tested in Guinea should be made available across West Africa after initial trials showed it halved mortality rates in some patients, the medical charity administering it said. . Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), which ran the trials of favipiravir in Guinea, said mortality rates fell from 30 to 15 percent in patients with a low to moderate Ebola count but was not effective on those with a high level of the virus. . The level of the Ebola virus in a patient’s blood is thought to be determined by the amount of time since infection as well as age and genetics.  . “We think this is a sufficiently encouraging sign for it to be made available to Ebola patients more widely,” said Augustin Augier, secretary general of ALIMA, which runs the treatment center in Nzerekore, in southeast Guinea. . An outbreak of Ebola has killed close to 10,000 people across West Africa over the last year. The number of new cases has plummeted but officials have said much work still needs to be done before the virus is snuffed out in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three worst affected nations. . Guinea’s government has already authorized the use of favipiravir in other Ebola centers where there are 40 patients. . Several health officials said the drug should be given in Sierra Leone, where more than 160 patients are suspected of carrying the virus.         . “It isn’t a miracle cure but it could help by improving chances of survival and getting people to come in for treatment earlier,” said Philippe Maughan, at the humanitarian branch of the European Commission. . ALIMA also wants to make it available to direct Ebola contacts, such as a baby breast-fed by an infected mother, as a preventative measure. . But the World Health Organization (WHO) said more research should be done. “There are not sufficient data to draw firm conclusions about this drug’s efficacy against Ebola,” a spokeswoman said. . Asked whether the WHO would facilitate the use of favipiravir more widely, she said: “It is up to national regulatory authorities how and whether to use it.” . The WHO has received hundreds of drug proposals, including unconventional treatments such as gastric juice from vultures, and has now narrowed the field down to 8-10 candidates. . Favipiravir, developed by a subsidiary of Japan’s Fujifilm to treat flu, has been used on some Western Ebola patients. No negative side effects were reported among 80 patients during the Guinea trial.  . Unlike some of the other drugs, there are thousands of doses available and it is relatively cheap. . The trial, sponsored by French health research body INSERM and made public on Monday at a medical conference, envisaged testing at least 120 patients, but falling cases in Guinea has made that difficult. . The trial of another experimental drug, brincidofovir, in Liberia was canceled due to a lack of patients. |Mon Feb 23 23:12:00 +0000 2015||Ebola drug in Guinea helps some, stirs debate on broader use |5.699981384481956e+17|http://reut.rs/1GmyNvr
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker on Monday called on the Congress to investigate the medical scopes blamed for an outbreak of a bacterial “superbug” at a University of California, Los Angeles hospital that has infected seven patients. . Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California, said in a letter asking for a congressional oversight committee hearing that the outbreak of the drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, bacteria posed “both health and national security” risks. . “If unmitigated, the human and societal costs of CRE outbreaks will continue to rise,” Lieu wrote in the letter. . “A superbug infection can kill not only the patient who was exposed to a tainted duodenoscope but also family members, friends and hospital staff who interacted with the patient,” he said. . Officials say the duodenoscopes, which are inserted down a patient’s throat during gastrointestinal procedures, spread the antibiotic-resistant bacteria to seven patients at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, contributing to two deaths. The other five are under treatment. . An additional 179 people who had endoscopies at the large teaching hospital may have been exposed to the potentially fatal pathogens, according to UCLA. . On Friday, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist said the agency was close to unveiling a detailed procedure designed to prevent the scopes from spreading the superbug. . Called a “surveillance culture,” the procedure involves swabbing the device after it has been disinfected and then allowing any microbes to grow into detectable colonies, much as doctors take throat swabs to determine if a patient has a strep infection. . The UCLA medical center has said it had been sterilizing the duodenoscopes implicated in the infection according to manufacturer standards. It has said it now uses a more rigorous process that exceeds national standards. . Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients. .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Parents who wash dishes by hand, instead of in a dishwasher, are less likely to have kids with allergies, according to a new study from Sweden. . While the researchers can’t say avoiding dishwashing machines prevents childhood allergies, they suggest that bacteria left on hand-washed plates may teach the body to tolerate its environment. . Other studies have suggested that growing up on farms and living in developing countries reduce a child’s risk of allergies, the researchers wrote February 23 in the journal Pediatrics. . The study’s lead author told Reuters Health by email that while those earlier findings are interesting, they can’t realistically be used to reduce allergies among children. For example, you can’t tell parents to buy a farm. . “We are trying to find sources of ‘harmless’ microbial exposures in daily life that may be good enough to reduce allergy in children who are otherwise not exposed to a rich microbial flora in the same way as farm-living children,” said Dr. Bill Hesselmar of the University of Gothenburg. . Hesselmar and his colleagues analyzed data from a 2007 survey of Swedish parents of 1,029 children ages seven and eight. . About 12% usually washed dishes by hand; 84% usually used a dishwashing machine. . About 23% of children from homes where dishes were hand-washed had eczema, a skin inflammation usually brought on by an allergy. The same was true for 38% of kids whose parents who usually used a dishwasher. . Similarly, about 2% of kids in homes with hand-washed dishes had asthma, compared to about 7% of kids using machine-washed dishes. . Even after accounting for other factors that may influence allergies among kids, the researchers found that those who lived in homes with hand-washed dishes were less likely to have allergies. . Overall, washing dishes by hand was tied to a 43% reduced risk of allergies. . Using fermented foods and buying directly from farms strengthened the link, according to the researchers. . In an editorial, Drs. Laurence Cheng and Michael Cabana from the University of California, San Francisco note that several questions still need answers. . For example, why does washing dishes by hand appear to protect more against skin conditions than against itchy eyes and running noses? And for the most part, the researchers would have to assume that parents’ dishwashing habits remained unchanged since the children’s infancy for the hygiene hypothesis to be applicable. . “Future recommendations may be based on these findings, but only if the results could be confirmed in new studies,” Hesselmar said. .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - In research that contradicts years of health advice, scientists said on Monday that babies at risk of developing a childhood peanut allergy can avoid it if they are given peanuts regularly during their first 11 months. . The study, the first to show that eating certain foods is an effective way of preventing allergy, showed an 80 percent reduction in the prevalence of peanut allergies among high-risk children who ate peanuts frequently from infanthood, compared to those who avoided them. . “This is an important clinical development and contravenes previous guidelines,” said Gideon Lack, who led the study at King’s College London. . “New guidelines may be needed to reduce the rate of peanut allergy in our children.” . Rates of food allergies have been rising in recent decades, and peanut allergy now affects between 1 and 3 percent of children in Western Europe, Australia and the United States. Peanuts cause serious allergic reactions in about 0.9 percent of the population of these regions, including about 400,000 school-age children. . Allergy to peanuts tends to develop early in life and sufferers rarely grow out of it.  . Allergic reactions range from difficulty in breathing, low blood pressure, swelling of the tongue, eyes or face, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting, skin rashes and blisters, inflammation, pain and, in some cases, death.    . Lack’s study, a randomized controlled trial, enrolled 640 children aged between 4 months and 11 months from the Evelina London Children’s Hospital who were considered at high risk of developing peanut allergy because they already had either severe eczema or an egg allergy, or both. . Half the children were asked to eat foods containing peanut three or more times a week, and the other half to avoid eating peanuts until they were five years old. . In results published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Lack found that fewer than 1 percent of the children who ate peanut regularly as required had become allergic by the end of the study, while 17.3 percent in the avoidance group had developed peanut allergy. . “Deliberate avoidance of peanut in the first year of life is consequently brought into question as a strategy to prevent allergy,” Lack’s team wrote in the study. |Mon Feb 23 21:46:22 +0000 2015||Scientists find peanut-eating prevents allergy, urge rethink |5.69976585715114e+17|http://reut.rs/1GmkU07
|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A California university student has been diagnosed with a bacterial infection related to meningitis, authorities said, days after a student in Oregon succumbed to the sometimes deadly disease that can be prevalent on college campuses. . The student at the University of California, Davis, is receiving care at a local hospital for meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that can affect the bloodstream or be a precursor to meningitis. . Public health officials in Yolo County near the state capital of Sacramento are seeking out those who have had close contact with the stricken student and offering them antibiotics, the university said in a press release. . Last week, University of Oregon freshman Lauren Jones, 18, died of meningococcal infection, a Lane County Public Health official said. . Jones was the fourth student at the Eugene, Oregon, school confirmed to have been infected with meningococcemia, a bacterial precursor to meningitis, since an outbreak began earlier this year. The other three students are all recovering, according to a statement issued by the university on Friday. . The University of Oregon also announced plans for a “full-scale vaccination program” beginning the first week of March, though it had already been offering vaccinations upon request. . The symptoms of meningococcal disease include high fever, severe headache, rash, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and confusion, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . It can spread quickly in close quarters, including college dormitories. Some strains can be prevented via vaccination. . The California student was not identified. |Mon Feb 23 21:05:52 +0000 2015||California college student diagnosed with meningitis-related infection |5.6996639402614784e+17|http://reut.rs/1EoxtJk
|OTTAWA/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Three more countries have blocked imports of Canadian beef or beef products, following Canada’s discovery of mad cow disease earlier this month, its first in four years. . Taiwan, Peru and Belarus have imposed trade restrictions,  the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Monday in an update on its website. The CFIA had earlier reported that South Korea had banned Canadian beef and Indonesia banned non-edible byproducts from Canada. . Canada confirmed the case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on Feb. 11 and reported it the next day. BSE is a progressive, fatal neurological disease believed to be spread when cattle eat protein rendered from the brains and spines of infected cattle or sheep. |Mon Feb 23 21:05:51 +0000 2015||Peru, Taiwan, Belarus ban Canadian beef in wake of mad cow case |5.699663917780214e+17|http://reut.rs/1GmdEBB
|HOUSTON (Reuters) - In surgery lasting more than 24 hours, a Texas hospital medical team has separated nearly 1-year-old twins who were joined at the abdomen and shared a liver, diaphragm, pelvis, intestines and the lining of the heart, officials said on Monday. . The girls, Knatalye Hope Mata and Adeline Faith Mata, born in April 2014, were separated on Feb. 17 at Texas Children’s Hospital, with a team including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses. . “This surgery was not without its challenges with the girls sharing several organ systems,” said Dr. Darrell Cass, pediatric surgeon and co-director of Texas Children’s Fetal Center. He said this was the first successful separation surgery for conjoined twins with this particular configuration. . The team had been preparing for months for the complicated surgery, drawing up three-dimensional models of their organs and holding simulations of the surgery that was carried out in carefully choreographed stages, he said. . The team worked for about 23 hours on Knatalye and 26 hours on Adeline with the official separation occurring approximately 18 hours into the surgery, the hospital said. . Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births and most do not survive. About 40 percent to 60 percent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 percent live only one day, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. . Mortality rates for twins who do live and then undergo separation vary, depending on their type of connection and the organs they share, it said. . The girls remain hospitalized and no release date has been set. |Mon Feb 23 21:05:46 +0000 2015||Conjoined twins separated at Texas hospital after marathon surgery |5.699663690029302e+17|http://reut.rs/1GmdCcS
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Novartis AG’s drug to treat patients who have relapsed after earlier therapies for multiple myeloma, an aggressive blood cancer, even though an advisory panel in November recommended against approval. . The drug, Farydak, in clinical trials almost doubled to 10.6 months the amount of time it took for the disease to progress, compared with standard treatment. But it was associated with a wide array of serious side effects, including severe diarrhea and heart problems, which are prominently listed in a boxed warning. . Farydak was approved for use in combination with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s Velcade and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone once a patient has received at least two prior treatment regimens. Prior treatments would include Velcade and an immunomodulatory drug, such as Celgene Corp’s Revlimid. . The FDA’s advisory panel of outside medical experts had voted 5 to 2 against recommending approval, saying the drug’s benefits did not outweigh its risks. . But the FDA, which usually follows the advice of advisory panels but is not obligated to do so, granted Farydak conditional approval, meaning that continued approval may hinge on demonstrating benefits in confirmatory trials. . Farydak was approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), a communication plan meant to inform health care professionals of a specific drug’s risks and how to minimize them.  . The disease is caused by an overgrowth of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell present in the bone marrow, which displace healthy cells and prevent them from functioning properly. Almost 22,000 Americans annually are diagnosed with the cancer, and almost 11,000 die from it each year, according to the National Cancer Institute.   . Multiple myeloma is incurable, and has a high rate of relapse. The Novartis medicine is the first among a new class of treatments called HDAC inhibitors, meant to help restore cell function. |Mon Feb 23 20:47:54 +0000 2015||Novartis' blood cancer drug wins U.S. approval |5.6996187226445005e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gmakq7
Chris Arsenault|ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world’s diet has deteriorated substantially in the last two decades, a leading nutrition expert said on Monday, citing one of the largest studies available on international eating habits.  . Poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are seeing the fastest increases in unhealthy food consumption, while the situation has improved slightly in Western Europe and North America, said Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.  . Between 1990 and 2010, middle and low income countries saw consumption of unhealthy foods increase dramatically, Mozaffarian said, citing information in a study he co-authored for the March edition of The Lancet Global Health journal.  . The “globalization” of western diets - where a small group of food and agriculture companies have disproportionate power to decide what is produced - is partially causing the shift to unhealthy eating, Mozaffarian said.  . Processed foods high in sugar, fat and starch are driving the growth of unhealthy foods.  . The study reviewed 325 dietary surveys, representing almost 90 percent of the world’s population, in what is thought to be the largest study yet of international eating habits.  . China and India recorded some of the highest increases in unhealthy food consumption, the study said. Some countries in Latin America and Europe saw an increase in both healthy and unhealthy food consumption.    . Between 1990 and 2014, roughly the same period as the study, the number of hungry people worldwide dropped by 209 million to 805 million, according to the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).  . “Most global nutrition efforts have focused on calories – getting starchy staples to people,” Mozaffarian told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We need to focus on the quality of calories for poor countries, not just the quantity.”  . Old people displayed better eating habits than the young in most of the 187 countries covered in the study.  . This is a worrying development, Mozaffarian said, as rates of obesity and chronic diseases like diabetes are set to increase if young people continue eating unhealthy foods.  . “Young people are growing up with much worse diets than their parents or grandparents,” he said.     |Mon Feb 23 18:02:52 +0000 2015||World's diet worsening with globalization, major study finds: TRFN |5.699203418894295e+17|http://reut.rs/1GlGHVR
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - In a new policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics says school nutrition has made incredible strides over the last two decades, but high-calorie, low quality foods are still available from informal sources like bake sales, birthday parties, and other events for which students, parents and staff bring treats from home. . “Great things have happened in terms of sweetened beverages, school meals, snacks and vended foods in schools,” said Dr. Robert Murray, professor of nutrition at The Ohio State University in Columbus and one of the two lead authors of the policy statement. . In the 92 percent of U.S. school districts that follow federal nutrition guidelines, cafeteria lunches are almost always healthier and in smaller portions than packed lunches from home, he noted. . “The problem now is (that) the foods of poor quality are the ones coming in from home from teachers and staff, used for birthday parties and for things like booster sales,” Murray told Reuters Health by phone. . These informal food sources are not regulated at the federal or state level the way lunches and other vending points are, he said. . Many parents say events like birthdays or bake sales are “special occasions” and allow kids to bring in sugary or fatty foods, since having a treat once in a while is fine. . But, Murray said, “when you have 30 kids in the class and they all have birthdays plus Halloween and holidays, and teachers who use food as reward, and you have clubs that sell food…”  . At his local high school, outside the cafeteria, every day a different student club sells food, largely baked goods like brownies, cookies or cupcakes. . “Great progress has been made, but there still is a pretty steady stream of poor quality food coming in to the school,” Murray said. “We as parents and teachers are responsible for a lot of that.” . In its new policy statement, the AAP does not recommend banning these foods, or controlling daily amounts of sugar, salt or fats with an iron fist. Rather, parents should consider their child’s whole diet and use ingredients that kids enjoy to encourage them to eat nutritionally wholesome foods. . “When you ask a person what constitutes a good diet, they tell you all the foods you shouldn’t be eating instead of focusing on the food pattern of the foods that you should eat,” which is not the right attitude, especially for kids, Murray said. . “In the 90s we avoided nuts, avocados, eggs, we kicked them out because of a single nutrient,” he said, referring to saturated fats. But because of the variety of healthy nutrients they provide, in addition to saturated fats, many of these foods are now encouraged, he said. . Banning single nutrients is the wrong choice, he said.  . When foods are restricted or banned, kids end up seeking out those foods or sneaking them, which creates poor eating habits, said Laura Jeffers, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the new study. . “If food is categorized as good or bad, then negative thoughts around food can occur,” she said. “Over time, negative thoughts about food may turn into negative self-image thoughts when ‘bad’ food is consumed.” . School meals have made great strides nutritionally, Jeffers told Reuters Health by email. . “This guideline goes a step further by focusing on the other food items that kids are exposed to at school and how to improve the quality and selection of food brought into schools (e.g., snacks, food during fundraisers and sporting events, etc.),” Jeffers said.  . There are non-food ways to celebrate occasions like birthdays, Murray noted, but if you do send your child to school with food, “make those foods higher quality nutritionally,” he said. “Instead of making chocolate chip cookies, can I make oatmeal (cookies)?” . If oatmeal isn’t sweetened, kids won’t eat it, and they’ll miss out on the fiber and other benefits it has to offer, he said.  . In some deserts, fruit can replace refined sugar, he noted. Kids may be more willing to eat fresh vegetables along with ranch dressing, which is a fair trade-off, he said. . “Parenthood is sales, it’s negotiation with your kid,” Murray said.  . SOURCE: .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - A study from Finland suggests that saunas might have health benefits – at least, for men. . During the study, men who spent time in a sauna seven times a week were less likely to die of heart problems or to die at all, compared to those who only visited the sauna once a week. . Researchers followed more than 2,000 middle-aged men in eastern Finland for about 20 years. The more often the men went to the sauna, and the longer they stayed, the lower their risk for sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease and fatal cardiovascular disease over those 20 years. . The association was strong even after many potentially interacting factors were taken into account, said senior author Dr. Jari Laukkanen, a cardiologist at the Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio.  . Starting in the 1980s, more than 2,000 men filled out questionnaires about their weekly sauna use.  About 1,500 men reported using a sauna two or three times per week, 600 said they used the sauna once per week and 200 said they visited the sauna four to seven days of the week. Only 12 men reported not using a sauna at all. . Duration ranged from two to 90 minutes at a time, and the temperature ranged from 40 to 100 degrees Celsius, or 104 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit, traditionally at low humidity levels.  . In 2011, the researchers used interviews, hospital documents, death certificates and autopsy reports to assess when and how participants had died.  . Overall, 190 men had died of sudden cardiac death, 281 died of coronary heart disease, 407 from cardiovascular disease, and 929 had died from other causes. . Ten percent of the once-a-week sauna users suffered sudden cardiac death, compared to almost eight percent of those who used the sauna two or three times weekly and five percent of those who went four to seven times per week.  . The pattern was similar for other heart-related deaths. And for death from any cause, the risk fell from 49 percent for the least frequent sauna bathers to 31 percent for the most frequent, the researchers reported in JAMA Internal Medicine.   . “There was an inverse relationship between sauna and (cardiovascular disease) risk, meaning that more is better,” Laukkanen told Reuters Health by email. “On the basis of these results, it seems that more than four sauna sessions per week had the lowest risk, but also those with two to three sauna sessions may get some benefits.” . Since this was an observational study, it only indicates that saunas and heart health are associated, not that one necessarily causes the other, said Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, who was not part of the new study. . Finnish saunas use dry heat, and these results may not apply to other types of saunas, Laukkanen said.  . “I must confess that although I have been a long-time fan of sauna bathing because it feels good, I had no idea it was associated with such dramatic health benefits and longer life,” Redberg told Reuters Health by email.  . If saunas do cause health improvements, they may do so either by relaxation or by physiological effects of heat, she said.  . “The act of sitting in a sauna is relaxing by definition as one can not be doing much else while in a sauna, and often they are enjoyed with others – friends or strangers,” she said.  “Physiologically, they may improve circulation.” . Differing activity levels did not explain the link between saunas and better health, Laukkanen noted.  . “Sauna bathing is very common habit related to our culture,” Laukkanen said. “In Finland saunas are not luxury items, almost everyone has access to a sauna,” sometimes a private one inside the home. . “We think that results would be very similar in different populations including women,” he said. “However, further studies are needed to show the effects of sauna among women and different age groups.” . People who are dehydrated or have low blood pressure may feel dizzy or faint in saunas, and drinking alcohol beforehand is not a good idea, Redberg said. . SOURCE: .

|TORONTO (Reuters) - Companies rushing to enter Canada’s fledgling medical marijuana sector have not adequately disclosed potential business risks to investors, Canadian securities regulators said on Monday. . A review by the umbrella Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) group found “unbalanced and promotional disclosure that often promoted the benefits, but failed to outline the risks involved,” CSA head Bill Rice said. . The CSA group, which includes regulators from Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories, said its review found a lack of consistent and clear disclosure about the risks, cost and time required before an issuer can begin licensed operations. . It also said disclosures by medical marijuana companies often have not discussed the many barriers and obligations involved in entering the industry. . Nationwide regulations govern medical marijuana in Canada, while in the United States marijuana is illegal at the federal level. This distinction has made the nascent Canadian sector attractive to both Canadian and foreign investors and has prompted a slew of listings in the past year.  . They include: T-Bird Pharma Inc, Tweed Marijuana Inc, OrganiGram Holdings Inc, Bedrocan Cannabis Corp, Aphria Inc and PharmaCan Capital. . The CSA did not identify the companies that were involved in its review, but said it has sent comment letters to all issuers in the scope of its review and asked 92 percent of them to file clarifying disclosure documents, which they have done. . The CSA said it found serious investor protection concerns at 25 reporting issuers. It said that these issuers were generally at a preliminary stage of entry into the sector.     |Mon Feb 23 16:46:30 +0000 2015||Canadian regulators warn on medical marijuana disclosures |5.699011243560837e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gls1G0

Canada’s competition agency also said on Monday that it would allow the deal to go forward. . To win U.S. approval for the $16 billion deal, Novartis agreed to divest assets related to its BRAF and MEK inhibitor drugs, now in development to fight melanoma, the FTC said. . The deal is one of three related transactions announced in April 2014 in which GlaxoSmithKline would buy Novartis’ global vaccine business, except for flu vaccines, Novartis would buy Glaxo’s cancer drugs and the two companies would combine to create a consumer healthcare business. . With Monday’s approval, the FTC has given the green light to all three portions of the deal. . Array BioPharma Inc, which is based in Colorado, has agreed to purchase the inhibitor drugs, the U.S. agency said. . The FTC said the divestiture was needed because Glaxo and Novartis were among a small number of companies that sell or are developing the inhibitors. |Mon Feb 23 16:46:30 +0000 2015||Novartis AG wins approval to buy GSK cancer drugs with conditions |5.699011226154271e+17|http://reut.rs/1EnvSTT
|(Reuters) - Humana Inc said on Monday that the U.S. government’s proposed payments to insurers that sell Medicare Advantage health plans would mean a 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent cut for the managed care company in 2016. . That is a steeper drop than the 0.95 percent figure the government proposed for the industry on Friday, but was still within expectations, analysts said, and Humana shares rose nearly 5 percent. . Humana said its geographic and member diagnosis mix affected the impact from the government payment rates. . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday evening proposed a cut in its funding of the Medicare Advantage health plans to older and disabled people. Analysts said insurer shares would likely rise on the move as the potential for a larger than expected cut was erased. . Indeed, shares of insurers rose in morning trading on Monday. Humana’s gains were larger because of the company’s heavy revenue emphasis in this area.  . In addition, Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said, the company disclosed on Monday that it had higher-than-average quality ratings, which could help its Medicare Advantage plan sales.  . Shares of Humana, which derives about one-third of its revenues from the Medicare Advantage program, were up 4.7 percent at $163.50.  . UnitedHealth Group Inc shares rose 2.5 percent, Aetna Inc rose 1.7 percent, Cigna Corp rose 1.3 percent and Anthem Inc gained 1.6 percent. Smaller WellCare Health Plans Inc, which focuses on Medicaid and Medicare, gained 5.5 percent. |Mon Feb 23 16:15:18 +0000 2015||Humana says U.S. government proposal would cut funding by up to 1.75 percent |5.698932723421512e+17|http://reut.rs/1EnnYKv
|BERLIN (Reuters) - An 18-month-old boy who was not vaccinated against measles has died of the virus in Berlin, health officials said on Monday, adding they would try to boost vaccination rates and increase checks on children’s status. . The German capital has seen about 600 cases of measles since an outbreak began last October, and the boy’s death reignited a debate about whether to make vaccination compulsory. It is not in Germany and some parents choose not to vaccinate their children due to fears about potential side effects. . More than 150 people across the United States have been diagnosed with measles, many linked to an outbreak authorities believe began when an infected international traveler visited Disneyland in late December.       . “We take the current situation very seriously,” said a spokeswoman for the German health ministry, which she said would increase advice available to parents of young children and step up checks on their vaccination status. . “If that doesn’t help, then we will have to discuss other measures,” she added, without giving further details.  . German Health Minister Hermann Groehe said over the weekend “the irrational scaremongering by some of those against vaccinations is irresponsible. Whoever denies their child a vaccination is not only putting their child at risk but also others, and this can lead to serious health problems.”  . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive vaccine efforts. But in 2014, the country had its highest number of cases in two decades.  . Some Americans object to vaccination on religious grounds, a view rarely heard in Germany. . Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.  |Mon Feb 23 16:15:18 +0000 2015||Child dies of measles in Berlin, Germany vows to boost vaccinations |5.698932700646318e+17|http://reut.rs/1Glmbod
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said it would postpone by at least two years the marketing application for its once-daily diabetes treatment to evaluate liver concerns, a delay some analysts said could doom the experimental drug. . Lilly said it wouldn’t seek U.S. and European marketing approval for basal insulin peglispro until “after 2016,” as it attempts to find out why some patients developed excess liver fat in late-stage studies..  . Shares were down 1 percent in late morning trading. . “This suggests a high likelihood that the program is dead, from a regulatory standpoint and/or a commercial standpoint,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  . If approved, the long-acting insulin would capture only about $500 million in peak annual sales, due to longstanding concerns about liver safety, Anderson said. . In the meantime, Lilly continues to develop a cheaper, rival “biosimilar” form of Sanofi’s blockbuster once-daily Lantus insulin that analysts believe could generate annual sales of $1 billion or more, to be shared with partner Boehringer Ingelheim.   . Indeed, the company may now take a far more bold stance in marketing its Lantus biosimilar once it comes to market, including aggressive rebates, Deutsche Bank said in a research note.  . Lilly said last month it planned to seek approval for peglispro in the first quarter of 2015 and that its drug for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes would help fill a significant void in its insulin portfolio.  . Its current insulins, Humalog and Humulin, had combined sales last year of $4.2 billion but are shorter acting and have had disappointing sales growth.  . Peglispro has not been associated with liver impairment, Lilly said on Monday, but noted that some patients in late-stage studies had increased levels of liver fat. A severe buildup of fats in the liver can cause inflammation and scarring of the organ, and progress to liver failure. . In clinical trials released last year, peglispro proved more effective than Lantus, Sanofi’s $7.2 billion-a-year brand, in reducing blood sugar levels of patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease which is linked to obesity. It also caused significantly fewer episodes of overnight hypogylcemia, a potentially dangerous drop in blood sugar. . But patients taking peglispro had seriously elevated liver enzymes, a sign of potential liver toxicity which could give an advantage to a newer long-acting insulin from Sanofi known as Toujeo that could be available by June in the United States. |Mon Feb 23 14:33:39 +0000 2015||Lilly delays submission to market once-daily diabetes drug |5.6986769103458714e+17|http://reut.rs/1EmZIbg
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has not done enough to investigate and control a deadly new MERS virus that has killed hundreds of people there and remains in many ways a mystery, United Nations health experts said on Monday. . Cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are surging again, but Saudi health officials and scientists appear unable to explain where the infections start and how they spread, the UN experts said. . The UN group - a international delegation of scientists and public health experts from World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Organization for Animal Health - visited Saudi Arabia last week to investigate a sharp rise in MERS cases. . MERS causes coughing, fever and breathing problems, and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. . “Critical gaps in knowledge remain, and several challenges ... will require further work,” it said in a joint statement. “How and why infections occur in the community is yet to be understood, and this is critical for stopping the outbreak.” . Initial scientific studies have linked MERS to camels, but disease experts say it is not at all clear how the infection passes from the animals. Many people infected in the community and in hospitals report no contact with camels, they note. . “There are so many aspects of the virus that are still unknown,” said Berhe Tekola, director of the FAO’s animal production and health division. . First identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family as the one that caused a deadly outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in China in 2003. There is no cure or vaccine. . The WHO, which has voiced concern about MERS and its potential to spread internationally, says 1,026 confirmed cases - including at least 376 deaths - have been reported since MERS emerged in 2012. Some 85 percent have been in Saudi Arabia. . Keiji Fukuda, a WHO virus expert who led this mission, said that despite progress in fighting MERS in hospitals, key infection prevention and control measures are still breached. . “When health workers are infected at work, this puts other healthcare workers at risk, but also can be a risk to all other patients,” he said.  . “Understanding where the breach in these measures is occurring and taking the steps needed to fully implement infection prevention and control measures can put an end to these ... infections.”   |Mon Feb 23 13:32:49 +0000 2015||U.N. experts warn of 'critical knowledge gaps' on Saudi MERS virus |5.698523794300682e+17|http://reut.rs/1GkV7FH
Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - New balance devices that improve stability have made shifting the new lifting of resistance training, fitness experts say, adding the challenge of instability to back-to-basic workouts.  . Exercise balls, sandbags and load-shifting body bars are among the tools popping up in bodyweight training, the minimal-equipment exercise routine that the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) tagged as the top trend for 2015. . “The idea of bringing the body into an environment that challenges stability and balance is on the up rise,” said Michigan-based trainer Derek Mikulski. “Shifting resistance constantly challenges the body’s center of mass so the core has to work harder.”  . The core refers to the muscles of the abdominals and back that support the spine and keep the body stable and balanced. . Mikulski is the creator of a new balance device called ActivMotion Bar. It looks like a body bar but is hollow and filled with steel balls that shift back and forth when moved.  . It is designed so that gripping, steadying and moving the bars, which come in weights from four and one-half to 18 pounds, (two to eight kilograms), in basic moves from curls to lunges will boost calorie burn, core strength and balance.   . Several U.S. fitness chains, including Life Time Fitness and Powerhouse Gym, have introduced the bar, which was rolled out earlier this year.  . Stabilizing tools, from exercise balls to Bosu balls, which look like half-balls, have been used in rehabilitation for decades, said Dr. Audrey Lynn Millar, a physical therapist with ACSM.  . But there haven’t been many studies about their impact on the healthy, she said.   . “Yes, it is activating the core and improving stability and balance but there’s limited evidence on whether it makes the healthy person stronger or faster,” Millar said. . But she added that ACSM recommends balance training at least twice a week.  . “Once people pass the 40s we start to see some minor balance issues, then more in 50s and 60s,” she said. “It’s not just an ageing thing, it’s a lack of use thing. If we stop using those muscles our body loses that fine tuning.”  .     Shawn Perine, editor in chief of the magazine Muscle & Fitness, said bodyweight training can improve a person’s physique.  . He said the ActivMotion Bar brings core muscles into play as you always try to balance.  . “There are many paths to fitness. Most important is to find one that fits your personality,” he said.   |Mon Feb 23 13:32:48 +0000 2015||Stability tools keep bodyweight fitness craze off balance |5.698523775090401e+17|http://reut.rs/1EmNnE6
|MUMBAI (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised concerns over production processes at a plant that makes oral contraceptives operated by Lupin Ltd, India’s fourth-largest generic drug manufacturer by sales. . The FDA inspected the plant in January this year, after which it issued the company a so-called Form 483, listing six observations on the manufacturing processes at the plant, Lupin said in a statement on Monday.  . Lupin didn’t disclose the nature of the observations. Once a Form 483 is issued by the FDA, a company has 15 days to respond before the FDA takes further action. . The FDA’s concerns come as India’s generic drugmakers continue to face close regulatory scrutiny on their products. In recent months, local plants of firms including Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, and Cadila Healthcare Ltd have all come under the FDA’s scanner due to production quality issues.      . The Lupin plant, at Pithampur in central India, produces both oral contraceptives and treatments for eye diseases for sale in the United States. The U.S. oral contraceptives market, in which Lupin is a leading supplier, is valued at about $5 billion and the firm has filed for approval of close to 36 products in that segment so far. . Lupin, which started selling oral contraceptives in the U.S. in 2011, said that since the FDA audit it has won U.S. approvals to launch one new drug and transfer production of two existing medicines to the same plant. The company also said it had received FDA approval for a generic version of Allergan Inc’s Lumigan opthalmic solution, which was filed from its Pithampur plant. . The FDA regularly audits plants that export products to the United States. When it issues a Form 483, it outlines conditions or practices at the plant that it believes may cause the products made there to be in violation of its standards. . The Pithampur plant is Lupin’s second-largest manufacturing  facility exporting to its largest market, the United States. The FDA letter could impact approvals of new drugs made at the plant, analysts at brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a note. . Lupin said the FDA in November inspected its plant in Pune in western India and did not outline any concerns.  . Shares in Lupin were trading down 2.5 percent at 10:29 a.m., after having fallen as much as 5.3 percent earlier in the day. The broader Mumbai market was down 1 percent. |Mon Feb 23 09:40:37 +0000 2015||Lupin says FDA raises concerns over plant in central India |5.697939442189476e+17|http://reut.rs/1Em96vO
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Babies who are breastfed have lower arsenic exposure than babies who are fed formula, according to a new study. . The powder and water used to make the baby formula may be sources of arsenic, which occurs naturally in the environment and in large doses is linked to serious health problems, the researchers write in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. . It’s not clear, however, whether the low levels of arsenic exposure in the study will turn out to be harmful, the researchers say. . Parents who need to use formula to feed their infants shouldn’t feel badly about the new findings, said Kathryn Cottingham, one of the study’s lead authors. Instead, they should pay attention to the water they’re using to make baby formula. . “People who don’t know what’s going on in their water should test their water,” said Cottingham, who works at the Center for Children’s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. . She and her coauthors note that arsenic occurs naturally in bedrock and is a common contaminant of well water. While the U.S. regulates how much arsenic is allowed in public drinking water, there’s no regulation of private wells. And in New Hampshire, where this study was done, private wells supply water to 40 percent of the population. About one in 10 wells in the state have arsenic levels higher than the 10 micrograms per liter that’s allowed in public drinking water. . Past research has shown that breast milk doesn’t contain high levels of arsenic, even when mothers have been exposed to high levels of the element. . Baby formula powder, however, may have low levels of naturally occurring arsenic, the researchers say. . For the new study, the researchers analyzed urine samples from six-week-old babies of New Hampshire women who were pregnant and recruited for the study starting in January 2009. . Out of the 72 babies in the study, 70 percent received only breast milk, 13 percent received only formula and 17 percent received a combination of the two. . “Overall, exposure levels in this age group are low and that’s great news,” Cottingham said. . They did find that infants fed only formula had the highest concentrations of arsenic in their urine, followed by those who received formula and breast milk. Exclusively breastfed infants had the lowest levels of arsenic in their urine. . Based on samples of the participants’ tap water and published data, the researchers say about 70 percent of the arsenic exposure in their study came from the formula powder. . “In conclusion, our findings suggest that breastfed infants have lower exposure to arsenic than formula-fed infants, even when drinking water arsenic concentrations are low,” the researchers write. . They also caution that their study has limitations, including not having enough information to make estimates of arsenic exposure for individual infants. They also only had a handful of babies fed exclusively formula. . Cottingham also said they can’t say that formula-fed infants or those exposed to higher levels of arsenic will have worse health outcomes later in life. . “As the (group of babies) ages, we’ll be able to follow and see if there are any associations with that time period,” she said. .

|(Reuters) - Eleven students at Connecticut’s Wesleyan University are being treated for overdoses of the drug MDMA, and one of them, a sophomore, is in critical condition, officials said on Sunday. . The sophomore at the elite school in Middletown was transported to a hospital early on Sunday with two students in less serious conditions but showing similar symptoms, Michael Whaley, vice president for student affairs, said in an emailed statement to the school. . Wesleyan spokeswoman Lauren Rubenstein said in an email that seven students were transported to hospitals “with overdose symptoms consistent with the use of Molly (MDMA).” Another four went directly to hospitals, she said. . Molly is the street name for a drug that is pushed as the pure powder form of MDMA, a banned substance. It is the main chemical in ecstasy, a psychoactive drug. . The incident is under investigation, Whaley said. |Mon Feb 23 01:09:36 +0000 2015||11 Wesleyan students treated for MDMA drug overdoses |5.696653439684485e+17|http://reut.rs/1GjcyGK
|CASTLEBAR, Ireland (Reuters) - Ireland said a second major cigarette manufacturer, Imperial Tobacco Group, has threatened legal action against the government over plans for a law requiring them to sell cigarettes in plain packets. . Ireland said in 2013 it wanted to become the first country in the European Union to ban branding on cigarette packages and reiterated its plans this week after the legislation prompted a threat of legal action from Japan Tobacco International. . The minister who has designed the legislation, James Reilly, said Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco had written to his department and that one of the firms demanded he tell them in writing by this week that Dublin would not proceed with the law. . “This week I received letters from two of the largest tobacco companies in the world threatening legal action against this state,” Reilly said in a speech at his Fine Gael party’s annual conference. . “I want to be crystal clear. We will put the health of our children ahead of the profits of Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International every time,” Reilly said to applause from supporters. . No one at Imperial Tobacco, whose cigarette brands include Davidoff, Gauloises and John Player in Ireland, was immediately available for comment. . In a response last year to Britain’s health department over its plans to introduce a similar law by May, Imperial Tobacco said plain packaging would infringe international law, could threaten future foreign direct investment into Britain and set a dangerous precedent for other sectors. . Australia introduced a ban a few years ago as a way to reduce smoking and is facing challenges at the World Trade Organization over complaints the laws create illegal obstacles to commerce. |Sat Feb 21 22:01:39 +0000 2015||Ireland says second major tobacco firm threatens legal action |5.692556569953526e+17|http://reut.rs/1GfuyS5
Alex Dobuzinskis|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An 18-year-old man who was one of seven patients infected with a drug-resistant bacterial “superbug” during a medical procedure in Los Angeles was under 24-hour monitoring at a hospital as he fought a severe infection, his attorney said on Friday. . Infection by the carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria, or CRE, during endoscopies at a large teaching hospital in the University of California at Los Angeles system has contributed to two deaths among the seven patients. . Officials warned that as many as 179 people who had endoscopies at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center may have been exposed to the so-called superbug. The procedures were done between Oct. 3 and Jan. 28. . All five of the confirmed infected patients who remain alive are under treatment, said UCLA spokeswoman Dale Tate.  . The infections all occurred during procedures in which a specialized scope, known as a duodenoscope, was inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. The outbreak has raised questions about whether methods for cleaning the endoscopes were adequate. . The 18-year-old man, whose name has not been released, was among those infected by CRE, said attorney Kevin Boyle, a member of his legal team. . The man went to the medical center in mid-2014 for a pancreatic ailment and received an endoscopy, Boyle said. The man became ill and was hospitalized a short time later. . By November, he had been diagnosed with CRE. The youth spent 83 days in the hospital, mostly in the intensive care unit, the attorney said.     . “It’s definitely a severe infection,” he said, adding that the infection had landed the young man back in a Los Angeles hospital. The 18-year-old was not in the intensive care unit but was under 24-hour monitoring.  . “The (man’s) prognosis is unknown,” Boyle said. He would not give the name of the hospital where the young man is being treated. . Further details on the conditions of the five infected patients have not been disclosed, and details on the circumstances of the two deaths have not been made public. . Officials have said there is no broader threat to public health, and that hospital officials have called and sent letters to at-risk former patients. All of them are at home, rather than at a hospital, Tate said. No further infections have been reported. . Corey Egel, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health, said the short-term risk window for additional CRE infections among the patients who came into contact with the scopes was over.  . There remains, however, a possibility of future infections if the organism was able to colonize inside any of the patients. . “Any person who is colonized with any multi-drug resistant organism is at some increased risk in the future of developing an infection with that organism,” he said.  . The medical center has said that it had been sterilizing the duodenoscopes implicated in the infection, which it began using in June, according to manufacturer standards. It has said it now uses a more rigorous process that exceeds national standards. . The two infected scopes were immediately removed from use for return to the manufacturer, Olympus Medical Systems Group. Olympus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  . Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients. . California’s public health department said no other hospitals in the state have seen a similar outbreak. |Sat Feb 21 06:07:02 +0000 2015||Youth fighting 'superbug' infection from Los Angeles outbreak |5.6901541760538624e+17|http://reut.rs/1GdREc3
Courtney Sherwood|PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - A bacterial infection related to meningitis is to blame for the death of a University of Oregon student-athlete who was found unresponsive in her dorm room earlier this week, public health officials said on Friday. . Freshman Lauren Jones, 18, was found unconscious on Tuesday and declared dead at a nearby hospital. An initial autopsy did not offer conclusive results, but tests completed on Friday confirmed that meningococcemia caused her death, Lane County Public Health spokesman Jason Davis said in a statement. . Jones was the fourth student at the school confirmed to have been infected with meningococcemia, a bacterial precursor to meningitis, since an outbreak began earlier this year. The other three students are all recovering, according to a statement issued by the university on Friday. . The university also announced plans for a “full-scale vaccination program” beginning the first week of March, though it had already been offering vaccinations upon request. . Davis said the Lane County Public Health department is not offering meningococcemia vaccinations to the general public as risk of contracting the disease is “extremely low” for people not associated with the school. . Meningococcemia spreads through close personal contact or prolonged exposure, and outbreaks of the bacterial infection are relatively rare, he told Reuters.  . But the close living quarters of university dormitories can create opportunities for the infection to spread, and several college campus outbreaks are typically reported every year. . The University of Oregon said in its statement that increased clinical staff will be available to offer vaccines to students next week, ahead of a more concerted vaccination effort that will begin in two weeks. |Sat Feb 21 03:49:27 +0000 2015||Meningitis bacteria to blame for Oregon student's death |5.689807961089024e+17|http://reut.rs/1EeVCll
Caroline Humer|(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday proposed a 0.9 percent cut in payments to health insurers for 2016 Medicare Advantage plans, which provide health benefits to more than 16 million elderly or disabled people. . The cut is part of a notice issued by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that sets premium rate benchmarks for Medicare Advantage plans. It reflects a 1.7 percent increase in healthcare spending as well as payment rates for factors such as health plan quality ratings, health reform costs, and sicker-than-average customers.  . Analysts and actuaries said some of these factors were worse than expected but added the proposal appeared to be near industry forecasts for a proposal that was about flat with 2015.  . “It was probably just slightly worse, but it takes the uncertainty away,” Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said. Shares will probably not get a “big pop” on Monday morning, but it does clear the way for investors, she said. . Shares of insurers that provide these plans, such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc and Aetna Inc, were mostly unchanged in after-hours trading on Friday.  . The insurance industry’s biggest lobbyist, America’s Health Insurance Plans, urged the health agency not to make any cuts to payments, saying it would risk benefit cuts and higher costs for seniors. Aetna said in a statement that the move could cause some plans to exit certain geographic markets. . Last year, insurers said the government cuts resulted in a 3 percent decline in payments or more, depending on where the plans were located and how sick their patients were. Insurers were able to negotiate the government down from its initial proposed high single-digit percentage cut, and Gupte said it was likely insurers would be able to lobby for changes this year as well ahead of the final policy that is due out April 6.  . Under the Affordable Care Act, the government must cut payments for Medicare Advantage to make them on par with the broader Medicare fee-for-service program. . One positive for insurers, analysts and actuaries said, is that the agency said it would not modify its payments related to home health assessments done by insurers. . A negative factor is that the government plans to fully phase in a new method of paying insurers whose customers are sicker than average, they said. HHS documents showed this as being a 1.7 percent decrease in payments in 2016. . “The fact that the agency provided leniency on the home risk assessments is a good thing. However, fully phasing in the risk adjustment model could be detrimental to some plans,” said Ipsita Smolinski, an analyst with Washington, D.C.-based research firm Capitol Street. . When combined with other factors such as medical coding adjustments by insurers, the payments could increase insurer revenue by 1.1 percent, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. |Sat Feb 21 01:25:30 +0000 2015||U.S. proposes 0.9 percent cut in 2016 Medicare Advantage payments |5.689445682149499e+17|http://reut.rs/1EeJeC1
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government is close to finalizing instructions to prevent medical devices responsible for transmitting “superbugs” from spreading the potentially fatal pathogens between patients, the scientist leading the effort said. . The new protocol for the reusable devices, called duodenoscopes, is being developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose disease detectives have investigated duodenoscope-transmitted infections since 2013. . In the latest outbreak, duodenoscopes spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria to seven patients at a University of California at Los Angeles hospital, contributing to two deaths.   . The CDC’s guidance would not be mandatory. Only the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authority to require a manufacturer to include more stringent safety instructions for medical devices. The FDA can also order products be redesigned. . The FDA has not taken either step, despite knowing since at least 2009 that duodenoscopes have spread pathogens among patients.  But this week it warned the medical community that the devices can transmit superbugs. . Though CDC protocols are not mandatory, they carry considerable weight because hospitals that ignore them could be vulnerable to lawsuits.  . Experts in infectious-disease control welcomed the CDC’s involvement, though they said it raised a larger question about the FDA. . “If the CDC, which does not have regulatory authority, is doing more (to make duodenoscopes safe) than the FDA, which does have that authority, it raises the question of who’s running the ship here,” said Lawrence Muscarella, an endoscopy consultant and author of a 2014 paper on the device’s pathogen-transmission risk. . FDA spokeswoman Leslie Wooldridge said the agency is “actively engaged with the manufacturers of duodenoscopes” and with the CDC “to develop solutions to minimize patient risk associated with” the devices. . Duodenoscopes are inserted down the throat during gastrointestinal procedures. Problems arise when the devices, which sell for upwards of $40,000, are not properly disinfected before being used on subsequent patients. . The CDC is close to unveiling a detailed procedure aimed at preventing more cases, said infectious disease expert Dr. Alexander Kallen of the CDC. . Called a “surveillance culture,” the procedure involves swabbing the device after it has supposedly been disinfected and then allowing any microbes to grow into detectable colonies, much as doctors take throat swabs to determine if a patient has a strep infection. . The protocol has undergone pilot testing at Virginia Mason Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle with good results, Kallen said. The Seattle hospital reported a duodenoscope-related superbug outbreak last month. . “We feel right now that we have a protocol people could use,” Kallen said. “Our goal is to have this available very soon if people think this is the right way to go.” . The duodenoscopes are made by Olympus Corp (. ),  Fujifilm Holdings Corp (. ) and Pentax.  . The manufacturers have been criticized for failing to redesign the scopes six years after their potential to transmit infections came to the attention of physicians and regulators.  . Olympus and Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pentax spokesman Mariano Franco said the company is working with the FDA and others “to determine potential approaches that would contribute to the mitigation of pathogen transmission with duodenoscopes,” but had not yet identified one “that would address these concerns.” . In an ironic twist, the CDC protocol would likely increase sales of the devices, according to Muscarella. Waiting for the results of the surveillance culture sidelines an instrument for days, so a hospital would likely need to have extra ones on hand to meet demand for the procedures. |Sat Feb 21 01:09:41 +0000 2015||Exclusive: U.S. health officials push for stricter 'superbug' defense |5.689405895904502e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gdo867
Alex Dobuzinskis|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An 18-year-old man who was one of seven patients infected with a drug-resistant bacterial “superbug” during a medical procedure in Los Angeles was under 24-hour monitoring at a hospital as he fought a severe infection, his attorney said on Friday. . Infection by the carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria, or CRE, during endoscopies at a large teaching hospital in the University of California at Los Angeles system has contributed to two deaths among the seven patients.   . Officials warned that as many as 179 people who had endoscopies at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center may have been exposed to the so-called superbug. The infections occurred between Oct. 3 and Jan. 28. . All five of the confirmed infected patients who remain alive are under treatment, said UCLA spokeswoman Dale Tate. . The 18-year-old man, whose name has not been released, was among those infected by CRE, said attorney Kevin Boyle, a member of his legal team. . The man went to the medical center in mid-2014 for a pancreatic ailment and received an endoscopy, Boyle said. The man became ill and was hospitalized a short time later. . By November, he had been diagnosed with CRE. The youth spent 83 days in the hospital, mostly in the intensive care unit, the attorney said.     . “It’s definitely a severe infection,” he said, adding that the infection had landed the young man back in a Los Angeles hospital. The 18-year-old was not in the intensive care unit but was under 24-hour monitoring.  . “The (man’s) prognosis is unknown,” Boyle said. He would not give the name of the hospital where the young man is being treated. . Tate confirmed that at least one of the five infected was hospitalized. . Further details on the conditions of the five infected patients have not been disclosed, and details on the circumstances of the two deaths have not been made public. . The exposures that led to infections all occurred during procedures in which a specialized endoscope was inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. The outbreak has raised questions about whether methods for cleaning the endoscopes were adequate. . Officials have said there is no broader threat to public health, and that hospital officials have called and sent letters to at-risk former patients. All of those are at home, rather than at a hospital, Tate said. No further infections have been reported. . The medical center has said that it had been sterilizing the duodenoscopes implicated in the infection, which it began using in June, according to manufacturer standards. It has said it now uses a more rigorous process that exceeds national standards. . The two infected scopes were immediately removed from use for return to the manufacturer, Olympus Medical Systems Group. Olympus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  . Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients.

David DeKok|HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - University of Scranton employee insurance plans will no longer cover abortions in cases of rape, incest or life-threatening pregnancies under a plan that the Jesuit school says is consistent with Catholic doctrine.     . But the Pennsylvania university’s faculty union, which represents about 300 of its 940 full-time employees, says members must first approve any changes to its coverage. . The union negotiated away coverage for elective abortions nine years ago in return for adoption coverage, but its current contract pays for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the live of the mother.  . In a letter to faculty released by the university on Friday, its president, Rev. Kevin Quinn, said that even limited abortion coverage is “inconsistent with the moral teachings of the church.” . The move comes as Pope Francis, the first Catholic pontiff who is a member of the Jesuit order, prepares to visit Pennsylvania in September. He has called on the Church to deemphasize divisive social issues like abortion and homosexuality. . Michael Friedman, an English professor who serves as union president, insisted that Quinn could not impose the change unilaterally. “The union must decide,” he said. . Stan Zygmunt, a university spokesman, said its lawyers have determined that the school, because it insures itself, need not abide by a Pennsylvania law requiring coverage for those types of abortions in traditional plans. . He declined to say what Quinn might do if the faculty refused to go along, or if the school would impose the changes only on non-union employees. Half of its employees are women. . Quinn, in a second letter to faculty on Tuesday, said life-threatening pregnancies are rare, but insurance would still cover indirect abortions resulting from procedures such as removal of a cancerous uterus.  . Friedman said on Friday that the union plans to meet Feb. 27 to discuss the proposed changes and will also conduct a confidential electronic poll of members. . “There is a lot of fear on our campus that speaking out might damage their employment prospects,” he said. . Catholic universities do not have a uniform approach to abortion coverage, Friedman said. Some cover all abortions, some only the three exceptions, and others none at all. . Planned Parenthood Keystone issued a statement decrying Quinn’s proposed changes. . “The University of Scranton’s decision displays a cruel indifference to the women who work there,” said spokeswoman Selina Winchester. “Religious restrictions put a woman’s health at risk.” |Fri Feb 20 22:50:11 +0000 2015||Pennsylvania college aims to end insurance coverage of abortions in rape cases |5.689054816343859e+17|http://reut.rs/1EetXkL
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Breastfeeding may help prepare a baby’s intestines to handle the introduction of solid food, a small new study suggests.  . Compared to babies who receive formula, babies who are exclusively breastfed may have “gut bacteria” that help them tolerate new foods more easily, researchers found. . The study findings are very preliminary. The researchers only analyzed the bacteria of nine children, and not the children’s reactions to new foods. So they can’t say if those who got formula had worse experiences with new solid foods. Still, the researchers say the results may explain some links between gut bacteria and health conditions. . Other studies have linked early feeding practice with long-term health outcomes, said Amanda Thompson, the study’s lead author from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. . Previous studies have linked gut bacteria to obesity, allergies, and infectious diseases, the researchers write in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology. . The nine babies ranged in age from one week to almost one year. Four were exclusively breastfed for part of the study. Some also received formula. Overall, eight received breast milk. . The researchers collected 49 stool samples from the children over an average of 16 weeks, to analyze each infant’s gut bacteria. . They saw what others have reported before: Kids who are exclusively breastfed did not have as much bacteria diversity and richness in their guts as those who were also fed formula. . But they also found something new: The gut bacteria in the exclusively-breastfed children didn’t seem to react as much when solid foods were being introduced, compared to the bacteria in children who also received formula. . As a measure of whether bacteria were reacting, the researchers used a tool to predict how many enzymes were active in the intestines before and after solid foods were started. Enzymes help with digestion. . In children who were exclusively breastfed, they saw an increase in 24 enzymes after the introduction of solid foods, compared to an increase in over 200 enzymes among children who also received formula. . Thompson said the larger number of enzymes in children who were not exclusively breastfed suggests that the introduction of solid foods was a bigger shock to their gut bacteria. . “All we’re saying is we do see these changes,” Thompson said. “Perhaps this is a potential mechanism explaining what other people have found in the literature.” . “It seems that introduction of solid food for babies that were only breastfed was more tolerable,” said Andrea Azcarate-Peril, the study’s senior author and the director of the UNC Microbiome Core Facility. . “Long-term studies are essential to confirm or not confirm these results,” she said, adding that the study results do support exclusive breastfeeding, which is recommended by most medical organizations. . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life. Then, mothers should continue breastfeeding for one year or longer as other foods are introduced. . Breastfeeding protects against a number of disease and conditions, including diarrhea, respiratory and urinary infections, diabetes and childhood weight problems, according to the AAP. . SOURCE: .

|ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Liberia plans to lift a night curfew imposed six months ago and reopen borders closed to contain the spread of Ebola, as the threat from the virus recedes, the president said on Friday. . Liberia was once the epicentre of an epidemic that has killed over 9,000 people in West Africa, but new infections have fallen off dramatically in recent months.   . Its schools began reopening this week in another sign that life is returning to normal.   . “President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has ordered the lifting of the curfew imposed nationwide. It takes effect beginning Sunday, February 22, 2015,” read a statement posted on the website of the presidency.  . No date was given for the reopening of the borders.  . A curfew from 9 p.m. (2100 GMT) to 6 a.m. (0600 GMT) was imposed on August 20, but modified the following month to begin at midnight. . Several states in the region closed border crossings, suspended flights and banned travel to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the countries hardest hit by Ebola, despite World Health Organization warnings that such steps would do more harm than good. |Fri Feb 20 22:29:51 +0000 2015||Liberia will end Ebola curfew and reopen borders, says president |5.689003640927519e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gd5eMM
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - An international team of United Nations human and animal health experts has flown to Saudi Arabia to investigate a recent surge in cases of a deadly virus known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. . Speaking from Riyadh on Friday, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization-led team said it was worried by a steep rise in cases of MERS, which has infected some 50 people in the Kingdom in February alone — one of the highest monthly rates since it first emerged in humans in 2102. . “We are all very aware of this surge in cases,” said the WHO’s Fadela Chaib, one of an 11-strong international MERS expert team due to end a three-day mission by Saturday. . “Although this is still a small outbreak compared to last year, we still need to understand more about what is happening.” . MERS is a respiratory disease that causes coughing, fever and breathing problems, and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Initial scientific studies have linked it to camels and it is known to have infected close to a thousand people, killing some 360 of them — the vast majority in Saudi Arabia. . First identified in humans in 2012, it is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family as the one that caused a deadly outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in China in 2003. There is no cure or vaccine for MERS, which kills around 40 percent of its victims.  . The WHO said earlier this month it was concerned about MERS and its potential to spread internationally.   . Chaib said the international team — including experts from the WHO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health — were talking to scientists and doctors, going to hospitals and visiting the government’s MERS command and control center (CCC). . Saudi Arabia has been criticized by WHO and others for moving too slowly to conduct the types of scientific study needed to pin down the source of the MERS virus and to establish how it infects people and passes from one person to another. . Many people sickened by the disease catch it while in hospital, or after contact with another case, and a few also report having direct contact with camels. . “They (the Saudi authorities) are making progress, but there is a lot more work to do,” Chaib said. |Fri Feb 20 22:14:09 +0000 2015||UN team investigates Saudi surge in cases of deadly MERS virus |5.688964143754076e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gd36Vk
Caroline Humer|(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday proposed a 0.9 percent cut in payments to health insurers for 2016 Medicare Advantage plans, which provide health benefits to more than 16 million elderly or disabled people. . When combined with other factors such as medical coding adjustments by insurers, the payments could increase insurer revenue by 1.1 percent, according to documents released by a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. . Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc and Aetna Inc provide these plans, which cover nearly one-third of all Medicare enrollees.  . Shares were mostly unchanged in after-hours trading on Friday as analysts said the proposal seemed in line with expectations. . Investors watch the government payment notice to gauge the operating environment for insurers who sell these plans and politicians examine the cuts to see how they might increase costs for the senior citizens enrolled in the plans.  . Last year, insurers said the government cuts resulted in a 3 percent decline in payments or more, depending on where the plans were located and how sick their patients were. . The government is mandated by the Affordable Care Act to  cut payments to insurers for Medicare Advantage in order to bring its reimbursements on par with the broader Medicare fee-for-service program. . One positive for insurers, analysts and actuaries said, is that the agency said it would not modify its payments related to home health assessments done by insurers. That issue has come up during the past few years and insurers have said it would be very costly to them. . A negative is that the government will also plan to fully phase in a new risk adjustment model, which determines payments to insurers who have customers who are sicker than average, they said. HHS documents showed this as being a 1.7 percent decrease in payments. . “The fact that the agency provided leniency on the home risk assessments is a good thing. However, fully phasing in the risk adjustment model could be detrimental to some plans,” said Ipsita Smolinski, an analyst with Washington D.C. based research firm Capitol Street. . More broadly, she said, the proposal appears to be in line with expectations although it can take days for insurers, actuaries and investors to parse the lengthy document. . The proposal will be followed by a 45-day comment period and a final notice is due out April 6. |Fri Feb 20 21:58:15 +0000 2015||U.S. announces proposed payments for 2016 Medicare Advantage plans |5.688924123886264e+17|http://reut.rs/1Gd0FC3
Daniel Wallis|DENVER (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. congressmen from Colorado and Oregon introduced separate bills on Friday that would regulate marijuana like alcohol in states where it is legal and tax sales of the drug at the federal level. . Colorado voters approved the sale and possession of recreational marijuana by adults in a landmark ballot in 2012 while Oregon voters decided last fall to follow suit.  . Pot remains illegal under federal law but President Barack Obama’s administration has given states that permit medicinal or recreational marijuana leeway in regulating its use. . The bill submitted by Representative Jared Polis of Colorado would replace the current federal prohibition model with a regulatory model similar to the one used for alcohol. It would remove the drug from the Controlled Substances Act.  . The bill introduced by Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon would tax marijuana at the federal level.  . “Colorado has demonstrated that regulating marijuana like alcohol takes money away from criminals and cartels, grows our economy and keeps marijuana out of the hands of children,” Polis said in a statement. . “It is time for ... a regulatory system that works and let states and municipalities decide for themselves if they want, or don’t want, to have legal marijuana within their borders.” . Two other states, Washington and Alaska, also have voted to permit recreational marijuana use by adults. . Opponents say weed from states that have legalized it is being smuggled into those where it is still illegal. Late last year Nebraska and Oklahoma went to the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge neighboring Colorado’s recreational marijuana laws. . On Thursday, two separate lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Denver by Colorado residents who argue that legalized pot violates federal racketeering laws, hurts business and diminishes property values.  . The office of Colorado’s attorney general has said it will vigorously defend all challenges to state law.  . Dan Riffle of the Marijuana Policy Project, the largest U.S. pro-pot policy organization, praised Polis and Blumenauer for proposing a way forward and said that for decades Congress had ignored the nation’s “broken and outdated” marijuana laws. . “Their failure to let go of prohibition is causing serious problems for state governments and interfering in the lives of countless Americans,” Riffle said in statement. . “It’s time for our federal representatives to come to grips with the fact that marijuana is safer than alcohol and most people think it should be treated that way.” |Fri Feb 20 21:33:33 +0000 2015||Colorado and Oregon congressmen pitch new federal pot framework |5.688861978645709e+17|http://reut.rs/1GcX8Uf
|DUBLIN (Reuters) - China has agreed to lift its ban on Irish beef, Ireland’s Prime Minister Enda Kenny said on Friday, making it the only European country to be allowed to export beef to both the United States and China. . Ireland last month became the first European Union country to regain access to the lucrative U.S. market, 17 years after Washington banned EU imports over the mad cow disease, or BSE, epidemic that spread from Britain to mainland Europe.   . “I’m delighted to announce this evening that we have now reached agreement with China on lifting the ban on Irish beef,” Kenny told his Fine Gael party’s annual conference, in a speech pitched at struggling rural Ireland, just a year out from parliamentary elections. . Demand for red meat in China, the world’s second-largest economy, has risen strongly in recent years due to rising incomes and a richer diet. Beijing started inspections of meat export facilities in Ireland in December as Dublin bid for the ban to be lifted.   . Only a few countries, such as Australia, Argentina, Canada and New Zealand, have had access to the Chinese market. China also banned beef imports from European countries following the BSE outbreak. . Ireland, whose food exports to China have more than doubled to 620 million euros since 2011, said Chinese veterinary inspectors would begin to approve processing plants for export following the formal lifting of the ban. |Fri Feb 20 21:15:29 +0000 2015||Ireland says China agrees to lift ban on Irish beef |5.688816491041055e+17|http://reut.rs/1EegZTZ
Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) – People who might be having heart attack should get aspirin on the way to the hospital, but about half of patients in the U.S. don’t get this potentially life-saving treatment, according to a recent review. . National guidelines recommend giving aspirin to heart attack patients as soon as possible, but emergency medical service (EMS) providers sometimes omit this vital step, the authors say. . “We were interested in knowing how often patients that presented with symptoms suggestive of a heart attack were given aspirin by EMS providers,” said lead author Dr. Katie Tataris, an EMS Medical Director in Chicago and assistant professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of Chicago. . Symptoms of a heart attack may include pain or tightness in the chest, shortness of breath or pain in the upper body. . Tataris and her colleagues write in the journal Emergency Medicine that people who take aspirin are 23 percent less likely to die from a heart attack and taking it early on is critical. . The study team reviewed data from the 2011 National EMS Information System database. They focused on nearly 200,000 people under age 40 who reported chest pain to paramedics. Patients who had an electronic cardiogram or heart rate monitoring in the ambulance were included, while those with chest pain related to injuries were not.  . Overall, paramedics gave aspirin to about 45 percent of patients. Black, Asian and Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to receive aspirin from the EMS provider. People living in the South were less likely to get aspirin than those in the East, West or North. . Patients with government insurance such as Veteran’s healthcare were the least likely to receive aspirin. However, the same was not true for those with Medicare or Medicaid. People with insurance through an employer had the greatest likelihood of receiving aspirin. . Age and sex did not affect the odds of receiving aspirin. . Tataris noted that the study can’t tell why paramedics failed to provide patients with aspirin. For instance, some patients might already be taking aspirin daily, or they might have a condition that prevents them from using it. Other patients might be more educated about the value of aspirin in case of heart attack or stroke, so some might already have taken aspirin before paramedics arrived. . The American Heart Association recommends that people with symptoms of a heart attack should first call 9-1-1 and ask the responder if they should take aspirin. The responder can help determine if there is any reason the person should not take aspirin, such as an allergy. . For most people, however, aspirin is a safe intervention, as only 2 to 3 percent of the general population has an intolerance to it, the researchers write. . Tataris agrees with this recommendation, saying in an email that “the administration of aspirin should be discussed between the patient and their health care providers in an emergency situation.” . Malcolm Woollard, former chair of the College of Paramedics and a visiting professor at the University of Surrey in England, said that although “early” aspirin is often recommended, “there is no evidence that ‘early’ means ‘within minutes’ rather than ‘within hours.’”  . Woollard said the main reason for recommending aspirin before getting to the hospital is to make sure that it is not forgotten. . He noted, however, that taking aspirin immediately is very helpful for other heart conditions such as angina. . One way for people to protect themselves is to take control of their own care, said Woollard, who was not involved in the study. He advised anyone over the age of 35 to carry aspirin with them and, “if they develop chest pain over a few minutes that they have never had before they should take an aspirin and call 911.” .

The VenaSeal closure system works by sealing the affected veins using an adhesive agent injected through a catheter. . Varicose veins are swollen veins that are usually blue or dark purple. They often cause muscle cramps and an uncomfortable, heavy feeling in the affected area. . Veins contain tiny valves that stop blood from flowing backwards. Damage to these valves can cause blood to swell in the veins. . Since the device does not use heat application or cutting, the in-clinic procedure allows patients to quickly return to normal activities. (. ) .

Shereen Lehman|Reuters Health - Adults who had multiple small meals every day tended to eat better, and weight less, than those who had fewer but larger meals, in a recent study. . People eating fewer meals tended to eat the most at night, and to drink alcohol with meals, both of which might contribute to their higher body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, the researchers said. . “The major hypothesis that can be taken away from this study is interesting but not so mind-blowing - eating more frequently throughout the day leads to a greater intake of healthier, lower calorically-dense foods, which in turn leads to a lower overall caloric intake and BMI,” said Elena Tovar, a clinical dietitian at Montefiore Medical Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study. . “This just makes sense - eating more often staves off hunger so that we don’t end up eating whatever we can get our hands on later on, thereby making it more likely that the foods we eat are healthier,” Tovar told Reuters Health in an email.  . Researchers in the UK, at Imperial College London, and in the U.S., at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, analyzed data from 2,385 adults from a study conducted between 1996 and 1999.  . They found that participants who reported eating less than four times during a 24-hour period had an average BMI of 29.0 and consumed an average of 2,472 calories.  . A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight and BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. . Participants who ate six times or more over 24 hours had an average BMI of 27.3 and consumed an average of 2,129 calories.  . People who ate more often tended to consume foods that were lower in calories and higher in nutritional value, such as vegetables, the researchers found.  . Meanwhile, people who ate less than four meals tended to consume more calories in the evening, and to have alcohol in the evening. This pattern is consistent with meals eaten at restaurants, where food tends to be rich or fried and it’s harder to get fresh, healthy foods, the authors note. . “Our findings demonstrated that lower BMI levels in more frequent eaters are associated with consumption of lower dietary energy density and higher nutrient quality foods,” the authors write in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. . “Modifying eating behavior through more frequent meals of low dietary energy density and high nutrient quality may be an important approach to control epidemic obesity,” they note. . They also acknowledge limitations to the study, including the fact that it doesn’t prove that timing or frequency of eating caused the differences in BMI.  . “Although this relationship requires further testing, it seems to support the idea that eating large meals later in the day may not be doing our waistlines any favors,” Tovar said. . Tovar highlighted the study authors’ speculation that the apparent effect of meal timing might be related to an increase in insulin sensitivity later in the day.  . “I would be curious to see more research on this topic in particular, especially because so many people these days are being told by practitioners not to eat after certain times at night without there being much science to back up these arbitrary requests,” she said.      .

Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Friday that 800,000 people who signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act received incorrect tax forms and should wait to receive new ones before filing their taxes.  . Roughly 95 percent of those who received the erroneous 1095-A forms have yet to file taxes, officials said. New forms will be issued in early March.  . The Treasury Department said it is weighing what to do about people who have already filed and will provide additional information “shortly.” . Republican lawmakers pounced on the mistake. . “The White House tells us in a classic Friday news dump that nearly one million Americans could see their tax refunds delayed because of this president’s inability to implement his own law,” Tennessee Representative Diane Black said in a statement. . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the glitch should have no impact on the ability of people to file their taxes by the April 15 deadline. He also said the issue affects “less than 1 percent of people who file taxes.” . The administration also said it would extend a special enrollment period for tax filers who were unaware they could face penalties for missing the Feb. 15 deadline to obtain health insurance through the federal marketplace at  HealthCare.gov. . The one-off special enrollment period will be extended from March 15 to April 30. If consumers do not buy health insurance during this period, they will have to pay a penalty when they file their 2015 taxes. Eligible filers must live in one of the 37 states with a federally facilitated insurance marketplace. . State-based insurance exchanges can set their own policies, officials said. . To qualify for the special enrollment, consumers must attest that when they filed their 2014 tax return they paid the fee for not having health coverage that year and that they first became aware of the implications of not enrolling in a timely manner after they began preparing their 2014 taxes. . The IRS has estimated 2 percent to 4 percent of tax filers, or roughly six million people, may pay a fee for not having coverage in 2014, which is $95 or 1 percent of income. . The fee increases to $325 per adult or 2 percent of income for 2015. Those who enroll during the special period will still owe fees for the months they were uninsured in 2014 and 2015. The special period is to allow people to avoid additional fees for 2015. |Fri Feb 20 15:39:50 +0000 2015||U.S. creates special Obamacare enrollment period for 2015 |5.6879718323707494e+17|http://reut.rs/1GbWrL5
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in Washington next week to discuss government efforts on the Ebola virus that ravaged West Africa, the White House said on Friday. . The meeting was scheduled for next Friday at the executive mansion, according to a White House statement. . “The president looks forward to building on a strong and historic partnership with Liberia and discussing a range of topics with President Sirleaf, including the ongoing Ebola response, the region’s economic recovery plans, and other issues of mutual interest,” the statement said. . Obama said this month he will bring back nearly all of the 1,300 U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic by April 30. The White House said the number of new cases each week had dropped to about 150 in recent reports, down from more than 1,000 new cases per week in October. . The epidemic has killed at least 9,365 people, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . In September, Johnson Sirleaf, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work on women’s rights, wrote a letter to Obama seeking urgent aid in tackling the worst recorded outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. .

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have known since at least 2009 that the medical devices at the center of the “superbug” outbreak at UCLA can transmit lethal infections but have not recommended any new safety requirements, a lapse that threatens patient safety, experts in hospital-acquired infections said. . The latest outbreak involving the reusable devices called duodenoscopes, which are inserted down the throat, may have exposed 179 patients at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles and contributed to two deaths.   . It is far from the first time medical investigators traced the sometimes-fatal spread of pathogens to the devices, which are manufactured by the medical units of Japanese companies Olympus Corp (. ), Pentax and Fujifilm Holdings Corp (. ). UCLA uses an Olympus model. . In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  received a total of 75 reports of adverse events associated with the devices, resulting in harm to 135 patients, the agency said. Because healthcare providers do not always submit such reports, the FDA said, that is likely an underestimate.  . After outbreaks, hospitals that began sterilizing the devices more rigorously than the FDA and manufacturers recommend did so have not had any further transmissions of dangerous microbes from the devices, the hospitals said. . In light of that success, “I would be in favor of the FDA putting out more stringent rules,” said Dr. John Greene, an infectious disease specialist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, where four patients were treated for antibiotic-resistant infections after undergoing duodenoscope procedures at Tampa General Hospital in 2012. . Instead, the FDA on Thursday issued a “safety communication” warning healthcare providers that duodenoscopes’ “complex design” may impede effective sterilization.   . For the first time, the FDA said that even when hospitals adhered to the manufacturers’ instructions for sterilization, patients have contracted multidrug-resistant bacterial infections from the devices. The agency did not, however, require more stringent safety procedures. . “The FDA punted,” said Lawrence Muscarella, a healthcare consultant in Pennsylvania and author of a 2014 paper on superbug transmission via duodenoscopes. . FDA spokeswoman Leslie Wooldridge said the agency is continuing to determine what more can be done to reduce duodenoscope-related outbreaks and is also exploring “additional potential strategies to reduce the risk of infections.”     . Duodenoscopes, flexible tubes outfitted with tiny lights and advanced cameras, are used to diagnose or treat disorders of the gastrointestinal tract in about 500,000 procedures a year in the United States alone. . In 2009, soon after 16 patients in France were infected with a pathogen after undergoing the procedure, the FDA issued its first notice about the devices, warning the medical community they could transmit dangerous germs from one patient to another. . In 2013, physicians led by the Moffitt Center’s Greene reported that endoscopes had transmitted an antibiotic-resistant pathogen to patients at two Tampa hospitals. That year also saw an outbreak from duodenoscopes at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital near Chicago, where 44 patients were infected with virulent, antibiotic-resistant bacteria called CRE, the strain in the UCLA outbreak. . The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center had a duodenoscope-related outbreak in 2012. Last month, Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle said a bacteria spread through contaminated scopes had infected 32 people over two years; 11 died.   . Infectious disease experts in academia and government who have investigated ways to prevent outbreaks have identified   three options, including sterilizing the devices with ethylene oxide gas after each use. . The Pittsburgh medical center “determined that the normal process” of disinfecting recommended by the manufacturer “failed to eliminate all bacteria,” said spokeswoman Allison Hydzik. The hospital switched to ethylene-oxide sterilization. . Alternatively, hospitals could swab duodenoscopes after each use to collect any lurking pathogens and quarantine the devices until it is clear they are sterile. Virginia Mason took this approach. . Neither Virginia Mason nor Pittsburgh has had another case of duodenoscope-transmitted superbug infection. . But such steps are expensive. . Duodenoscopes cost about $40,000 and as much as $80,000, and when they are taken out of service for gassing or quarantining a hospital may need to spend an additional $1 million to have enough available, said Muscarella. . A third option would be for the FDA to require manufacturers to redesign the devices. The agency and researchers agree that the most problematic part is a movable “elevator” mechanism at the tip of the duodenoscope: Its moving parts have microscopic crevices where bodily fluids can lurk after standard cleaning. . Fujifilm spokeswoman Diane Rainey said the company is reviewing the FDA safety alert and is “working in cooperation with the FDA to evaluate and respond to concerns” about disease transmission. . Olympus spokesman Mark Miller said the company is “aware of reports of patient infections following procedures involving duodenoscopes,” and is “monitoring this issue closely.” . Pentax did not immediately respond to questions. .

|(Reuters) - Europe has approved the Western world’s first medicine containing stem cells to treat a rare condition caused by burns to the eye, marking a milestone in the use of the technology. . Holoclar, from privately held Italian company Chiesi, was given a marketing green light on Friday by the European Commission for treating so-called limbal stem cell deficiency due to physical or chemical burns. Left untreated, the condition can result in blindness. . The stem-cell therapy is a living-tissue product. It resembles a contact lens and is made from a biopsy taken from a small undamaged area of a patient’s cornea and grown in the laboratory using cell culture. . The conditional marketing authorization had been expected, following a positive recommendation by the European Medicines Agency in December. . Chiesi said the approval meant that Holoclar would be available “in the near future” to all suitable patients in Europe, including people who have suffered eye injuries caused by solvents, acids, abrasive and chemical agents”. |Fri Feb 20 14:07:50 +0000 2015||Europe approves Western world's first stem-cell therapy for rare eye condition |5.687740274032558e+17|http://reut.rs/1GbG6Ws
|COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, the world’s biggest insulin maker, said on Friday it had received positive results from a Phase II trial of an oral version of a long-acting GLP-1 drug for treatment of people with type 2 diabetes. . Novo shares jumped and by 1400 GMT were up almost 6 percent, hitting a record 314.90 crowns.  . The results open the door to another, final phase of trials before potential regulatory approvals. . The process could take a year or more to complete, but promises to bring forward the treatment of diabetes by pills rather than injections, long considered an important step for the Danish company as well as for diabetes sufferers. . GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide-1, drugs work by stimulating the release of insulin when blood-sugar levels become too low. Novo has a strong presence in the GLP-1 market with its once-daily injection treatment Victoza. . Other drugs to treat diabetes in pill format exist, but to treat earlier-onset of the disease or different symptoms. . Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft noted the trial success moved Novo a step closer to tapping into what could be a 100 billion Danish crown ($15 billion) market for oral type 2 diabetes treatments.  . Tim Race, analysts with Deutsche Bank, said should Novo proceed with developing the drug, he expected a launch no earlier than in 2020. . “Clearly further data release is required to fully understand the profile and how the drug would stack up in a largely generic oral market at the time of launch,” he said. . “Feasibility is not currently fully assured given the large amount of drug substance required and the step-up in capital expenditure likely required to meet potential demand.” |Fri Feb 20 13:29:36 +0000 2015||Novo Nordisk has positive trial results for oral insulin, shares jump |5.6876440572440986e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ed6ujC
Ludwig Burger|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer is in talks to sell its diabetes devices division but a sale is not imminent, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. . Bayer is making a second attempt to sell the Contour blood glucose-meter business, which had annual sales of 722 million euros ($819 million) in 2013, as it overhauls its business to focus on margin-rich healthcare sectors. . KKR-backed Panasonic Healthcare Holdings has been in talks with Bayer over the diabetes devices division for some time, but final bids are some weeks off, one source with direct knowledge of the matter said. . The U.S. private equity firm owns 80 percent of Panasonic Healthcare and Panasonic Corp owns 20 percent. . Panasonic Healthcare, KKR and Bayer all declined to comment. . Bloomberg reported on Thursday that a sale to Panasonic Healthcare, which could be valued at between 1 billion and 2 billion euros, could be announced as soon as Friday. . Bayer had tried to find a buyer for the business in 2012 as the industry grappled with increased competition and reimbursement pressures due to tight public healthcare budgets but it failed to generate sufficient interest from potential suitors, sources said at the time. . Panasonic Healthcare, with its emphasis on personalized healthcare and technology, is seen as a good fit for Contour.   . Bayer also plans to list its plastics business on the stock market to free up money for investments and acquisitions in healthcare, veterinary drugs and crop protection products. |Fri Feb 20 12:19:32 +0000 2015||Bayer diabetes business sale not imminent: sources |5.6874677338630554e+17|http://reut.rs/1GboWbz
Tom Miles|GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization has approved the first rapid test for Ebola in a potential breakthrough for ending an epidemic that has killed almost 10,000 people in West Africa, it said on Friday. . The test, developed by U.S. firm Corgenix Medical Corp, is less accurate than the standard test but is easy to perform, does not require electricity, and can give results within 15 minutes, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.  . “It’s a first rapid test. It’s definitely a breakthrough,” he said. . The standard laboratory test has a turnaround time of 12-24 hours. While the Corgenix test is not failsafe, it could quickly identify patients who need quarantine and make it much easier to verify rapidly any new outbreaks. . Procurement and roll-out of the test kits will not begin immediately because the company is still working out costing and needs a week or two more to finish administrative procedures with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Jasarevic said.  . The health charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, which has been at the forefront of the fight against Ebola, had expressed an interest, he said.  . The so-called ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test involves putting a drop of blood on a small paper strip and waiting 15 minutes for a reaction in a test tube. It is able to correctly identify about 92 percent of Ebola infected patients and 85 percent of those not infected with the virus, the WHO said. . Knowing that margin of error is a major help, said Robyn Meurant, from the WHO’s department of essential medicines and health products.  . “The big fear has been that the market gets flooded with tests of unknown quality, or unknown performance, and with Ebola you need to know what are the limitations. A false negative has enormous implications. So does a false positive,” she said. . “So this is not a perfect test but... for a rapid test, (it is) not too bad at all.”   . It would be especially useful if a cluster of suspected cases flared up, she said.  . “If you had five patients with suspected symptoms and you went ahead and tested them and they were all positive you’d have a high degree of confidence that you’ve got Ebola.”  . Because of the margin of error, the Corgenix test would then need to be followed up by the standard laboratory test. . The WHO is still assessing four or five other rapid test candidates, but Meurant said it was not possible to say when the next approval might be. .

Anjali Athavaley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumers are shifting away from weight-management foods, forcing companies ranging from Kellogg Co to Nestle SA to change ingredients and focus their marketing on different health benefits as sales slip. . Food companies are grappling with how to market brands such as Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice and Special K, and come out with new products tailored to changing tastes. These days, companies say, consumers care more about ingredients that are simple to understand than they do about counting calories. They also want more ethnic flavors, as well as foods that are higher in protein and gluten-free. . Nestle will shift its Lean Cuisine frozen dinners from a diet brand to one built around “healthy eating and healthy lifestyles,” said Jeff Hamilton, president of the prepared food division, in an interview on Thursday. . The company, whose 2014 sales fell below its long-term goals, said that its performance in North America was hurt by its frozen foods business. Hamilton said the category has been declining annually at an average of 2 percent in recent years. . Instead of retaining the brand’s signature white box, which gave it a “diet” look, Nestle said, the company will use new packaging with bolder graphics to help Lean Cuisine stand out in the grocery aisle. Nestle is also rolling out new ethnic flavors such as Sweet & Spicy Korean-Style Beef. . “We have a heritage of being a diet brand, and we need to move to where the consumer is going,” Hamilton said in an interview.  . The changes come at a time when U.S. consumers’ perceptions of what is healthy are changing. According to a Nielsen study of 30,000 people released in January, the number of U.S. respondents who said they were cutting down on fats dropped 14 percent between 2011 and 2014. Meanwhile, the number of people who turned to diets low in carbohydrates to lose weight increased 10 percent. . Eating smaller portions and fewer processed foods was also popular strategy, the study said. . John Bryant, CEO of Kellogg, said in an interview last week that consumers wanted snack bars with ingredients that appear to be natural even if they are not low in calories.  . “They’re still buying bars, but they’re often buying bars that are higher in calories and higher in fat,” he said.  . The company is changing the packaging and advertising for its Special K brand to reduce a focus on weight loss, as well as adding varieties of bars with ingredients that consumers can see in the product, such as fruit pieces and rice crisps. . Kellogg is making the changes in response to sluggish sales in its U.S. snack business, which declined 3.1 percent when adjusted for currency and acquisitions in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 3.  . Investors should not expect to see immediate results from companies’ efforts to rebrand diet foods, however. In Kellogg’s case, Special K is “obviously something that has been challenging the business for some time,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. “It definitely is not something we expected to change and improve over night.” . ConAgra Foods Inc says its new Healthy Choice Simply Café Steamers are made with “100 percent natural chicken.” “As the definition of health evolves, we evolve our meals,” saidJenn Freeman, vice president and general manager, through a ConAgra spokeswoman. . Consumers should also be skeptical that the new wave of foods marketed as healthy will help them lose pounds. “Researchers say that health and wellness foods carry a health halo that seduces people into thinking the products have no calories,” said Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition at New York University. “Alas, they do.” |Fri Feb 20 07:20:12 +0000 2015||Food companies aim to reinvent diet foods to stay relevant |5.68671444546261e+17|http://reut.rs/1GaJpxp
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A senior California health official said on Thursday the source of a measles outbreak that has sickened 119 people in the state may never be identified, despite a finding that the same strain of virus had led to a wave of illness in the Philippines. . More than 150 people across the United States have been diagnosed with measles, many linked to an outbreak that authorities believe began when an infected international traveler visited Disneyland in late December. . California Department of Public Health researchers who genotyped specimens from 30 of the state’s measles patients found all were of the same strain that caused an outbreak in the Philippines. . That same genotype has been detected in at least 14 countries and six other U.S. states in the past six months, the researchers said, and the source of the illness that sickened visitors at Disneyland has not been found. . “It is unlikely that the source of this outbreak will be identified, and although identifying the source would be of interest, our immediate goal is to stop the outbreak and it is not necessary to know the source to do this,” Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the California Department of Health, told Reuters. . Chavez said identifying the measles genotype could help determine the country where the initial measles exposure  occurred but would not help officials stop the spread of the highly contagious virus. . The Disneyland resort in Anaheim receives millions of visitors a year, many of them coming from overseas.  . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . According to the California health department, 39 of the 119 people who contracted measles in the state were believed to have been exposed while visiting Disneyland. An additional 35 had contacts with those people in a household or community setting. . The state health department said 45 other cases had an unknown exposure source but were presumed linked to the Disneyland outbreak. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014, the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. . Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.  |Fri Feb 20 02:27:28 +0000 2015||California health officials say may not find source of measles outbreak |5.685977741005087e+17|http://reut.rs/1EbIFc5
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google-backed 23andMe won U.S. approval on Thursday to market the first direct-to-consumer genetic test for a mutation that can cause children to inherit Bloom syndrome, a rare disorder that leads to short height, an increased risk of cancer and unusual facial features. . The Food and Drug Administration said it plans to issue a notice to exempt this and other carrier screening tests from the need to win FDA review before being sold. There will be a 30-day period for public comment. . “This action creates the least burdensome regulatory path for autosomal recessive carrier screening tests with similar uses to enter the market,” the agency said in a statement, referring to genetic mutations carried by two unaffected parents. . The FDA previously barred Mountain View, California-based 23andMe from marketing a saliva collection kit and personal genome service designed to identify a range of health risks including cancer and heart disease, saying it had not received marketing clearance. . The current approval is for a much narrower slice of the genetic testing market. . “The FDA believes that in many circumstances it is not necessary for consumers to go through a licensed practitioner to have direct access to their personal genetic information,” Alberto Gutierrez, director of the FDA’s office of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health said in a statement. . “These tests have the potential to provide people with information about possible mutations in their genes that could be passed on to their children,” he added. . The company conducted two studies to show that the test is accurate in detecting Bloom syndrome carrier status, the agency said. The test is intended for post-natal carrier screening in adults. . “No test is perfect,” the FDA said. “Given the probability of erroneous results and the rarity of these mutations, professional societies typically recommend that only prospective parents with a family history of a genetic disorder undergo carrier screening.” . Company co-founder Anne Wojcicki said in an interview that 23andMe has not yet decided how much the test will cost or exactly when it will be available though she expects it will be “some time this year.” .  She said the company has 40 more screening tests of this type that it hopes gradually to introduce. . The company has not given up hope that it can win FDA approval for other types of genetic tests for which the agency currently requires premarket approval, she said. . “This is the first step in what we hope will continue to be an evolving journey, she said. |Fri Feb 20 01:47:09 +0000 2015||FDA approves 23andMe's genetic screening test for rare disorder |5.685876315017093e+17|http://reut.rs/1G9YzCT
Steve Gorman|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A large Los Angeles teaching hospital has told scores of patients they may have been exposed to a drug-resistant bacterial “superbug” during endoscopy procedures that infected seven patients and contributed to two deaths. . More than 170 patients who may have been infected by the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are being offered home testing kits that would be analyzed by the University of California at Los Angeles hospital system, UCLA officials said.  . The possible exposures occurred at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center between Oct. 3 and Jan. 28 during procedures in which a specialized endoscope is inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. . The UCLA hospital system said an internal investigation determined in late January that CRE may have been transmitted to patients by two of seven scopes being used by the center, all made by Olympus Medical Systems Group. (. )  . It said 179 people may have been exposed, seven of whom were confirmed to have infections, and two of whom died. The circumstances of the deaths have not been disclosed, nor have details on the conditions of the five other infected patients.  . “It’s important to emphasize: This particular outbreak of CRE is not a threat to the health of the public in Los Angeles County,” said Benjamin Schwartz, deputy chief of the acute communicable disease control program at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. . He told a news conference that the five surviving infected patients were being treated with antibiotics. . Zachary Rubin, an associate clinical professor and medical director at the center, told reporters: “Our hearts go out to the people who were involved and to the patients who passed away as a result of this infection.”      . Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients. . The hospital where the infections took place had been sterilizing the scopes, which it began using last June, according to the standards stipulated by Olympus, the center said in a statement.  . It said it now used a more rigorous process “that goes above and beyond manufacturer and national standards” and involves a second sterilization process using a gas called ethylene oxide.  . The two infected scopes were immediately removed from use for return to Olympus, and the hospital out of “an abundance of caution” was notifying all patients who were examined with any of the seven instruments during that period, it added.  . Both the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and the California Department of Public Health were notified as soon as the bacteria were detected, UCLA officials said. . Superbug infections are difficult to treat because some of the bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the germs could contribute to death in up to 50 percent of infected patients. . Rubin said it had taken time to search through patients’ charts to find those individuals who might have been exposed.  . “We don’t want to start notifying people who had no risk of exposure and cause undue anxiety,” he said. “We ended up working backwards and that unfortunately was the cause of some delay.”    . He said most of those possibly affected had been reached by phone: “We haven’t spoken to every single patient yet, but we’ve left messages, we’ve sent letters.”  . The complex design of the endoscopes linked to the California outbreak, known as duodenoscopes, may hinder proper cleaning, the FDA warned on Thursday.   . In addition to Olympus, two other major manufacturers of the scopes are Fujifilm (. ) and Pentax. All three companies’ disinfection recommendations were approved by the FDA. . Some experts advocate the use of disposable, single-use instruments, rather than reusable ones that must be sterilized after every procedure.  . In January, Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle said a bacteria spread through contaminated endoscopes had infected 32 people in that facility over two years.   |Fri Feb 20 01:29:01 +0000 2015||Los Angeles hospital warns 179 patients possibly exposed to 'superbug' |5.685830659934208e+17|http://reut.rs/1G9VB1d
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have known since at least 2009 that the medical devices at the center of the “superbug” outbreak at UCLA can transmit lethal infections but have not recommended any new safety requirements, a lapse that threatens patient safety, experts in hospital-acquired infections said. . The latest outbreak involving the reusable devices called duodenoscopes, which are inserted down the throat, may have exposed 179 patients at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles and contributed to two deaths.   . It is far from the first time medical investigators traced the sometimes-fatal spread of pathogens to the devices, which are manufactured by the medical units of Japanese companies Olympus Corp (. ), Pentax and Fujifilm Holdings Corp (. ). UCLA uses an Olympus model. . In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  received a total of 75 reports of adverse events associated with the devices, resulting in harm to 135 patients, the agency said. Because healthcare providers do not always submit such reports, the FDA said, that is likely an underestimate.  . After outbreaks, hospitals that began sterilizing the devices more rigorously than the FDA and manufacturers recommend did so have not had any further transmissions of dangerous microbes from the devices, the hospitals said. .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Malaria with total resistance to the antimalarial drug artemisinin has taken hold in Myanmar and spread close to the border with India, threatening to repeat history and render crucial medicines useless, scientists said on Friday. . If the spread of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites were to reach into India, they said, that would pose a serious threat to the chances of global control and eradication of the killer mosquito-borne disease. . And if resistance spreads from Asia to Africa, or emerges in Africa independently — as has been seen before with previously effective but now powerless antimalarials, “millions of lives will be at risk”, they said in a report. . “Myanmar is considered the front line in the battle against artemisinin resistance as it forms a gateway for resistance to spread to the rest of the world,” said Charles Woodrow of the Mahidol-Oxford tropical medicine research unit, who led the study at Oxford University. . In a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, Woodrow’s team collected 940 parasite samples at 55 malaria treatment centres across Myanmar and its border regions. They found that almost 40 percent of the samples had mutations in their so-called kelch gene, K13 — a known genetic signal of artemisinin drug resistance. . They also confirmed resistant parasites in Homalin, in the Sagaing Region, only 25 km (15 miles) from the Indian border. . While there have been significant reductions in the numbers of people falling ill and dying from malaria, it still kills around 600,000 a year — most of them children in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa. . From the late 1950s to the 1970s, chloroquine-resistant malaria spread across Asia to Africa, leading to a resurgence of cases and millions of deaths. . Chloroquine was replaced by sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), but resistance to SP subsequently emerged in western Cambodia and again spread to Africa. SP was replaced by artemisinin combination treatment, or ACT, and experts now worry that history may repeat itself yet again. . “The pace at which artemisinin resistance is spreading or emerging is alarming,” said Philippe Guerin, director of the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network. . Woodrow noted that thanks to advances in the science of genetic analysis, researchers tracking artemisinin antimalarials are in “the unusual position of having molecular markers for resistance before resistance has spread globally”. . “The more we understand about the current situation... the better prepared we are to adapt and implement strategies to overcome the spread of further drug resistance,” he said. |Fri Feb 20 01:29:00 +0000 2015||Drug-resistant malaria found close to Myanmar border with India |5.685830616481096e+17|http://reut.rs/1G9VySY
Keith Coffman|DENVER (Reuters) - Two lawsuits seeking to shut down Colorado’s recreational marijuana industry were filed on Thursday by state residents who say legalized pot violates federal racketeering laws, hurts business and diminishes property values. . The complaints, one aimed at state government officials and the other at marijuana businesses, were filed in U.S. District Court in Denver by a hotel operator and the owners of a Colorado horse ranch. . Colorado is among four states where voters have approved the possession and sale of marijuana for recreational purposes, although pot is illegal for any purpose under federal law. . President Barack Obama’s administration has allowed states that permit medicinal or recreational marijuana leeway in regulating its use. . In a news conference to announce the lawsuits, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, David Thompson, accused Obama of turning a blind eye to the enforcement of federal drug laws, saying: “In this country, only Congress can change federal law, not the president.”  . Thompson, a lawyer with Safe Streets Alliance, a Washington-based organization aimed at reducing youth drug use and violence, said Colorado’s regulatory scheme amounted to an illegal drug conspiracy and as such was “a quintessential racketeering enterprise.” . The hotel operator’s lawsuit said: “Marijuana businesses make bad neighbors. They drive away legitimate businesses customers, emit pungent, foul odors, attract undesirable visitors, increase criminal activity, increase traffic, and reduce property values.”  . Another plaintiff, Hope Reilly, told reporters she planned to open an animal-assisted therapy program for children on the 105-acre horse property she owns in the south of the state. . “Having a recreational marijuana cultivation facility next door interferes with that,” she said. . In December, Colorado’s marijuana laws were challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court by the neighboring states of Nebraska and Oklahoma, which say marijuana sold in Colorado has been smuggled across state lines. . The Colorado Attorney General’s Office has vowed to defend against that lawsuit, and a spokeswoman for the office said on Thursday the agency would likewise fight the latest legal action in order to uphold state law. . The owners of the marijuana businesses named as defendants in the lawsuit could not immediately be reached for comment, but supporters of the industry spoke in favor of the state’s regulatory efforts. . Democratic State Representative Jonathan Singer said Colorado had reaped millions in taxes and fees for much-needed programs since recreational cannabis became legal.  . “The sky hasn’t fallen,” Singer said. “We have to stop rehashing the fights of old.” |Thu Feb 19 23:56:38 +0000 2015||Two lawsuits seek to end Colorado's recreational pot sales |5.685598181868831e+17|http://reut.rs/1G9EvRc
Jane Wardell|SYDNEY (Reuters) - An outbreak of hepatitis A in Australia, probably caused by frozen berries packaged in China, is giving added impetus to moves to tighten the country’s murky food labeling laws and could fuel a backlash against imported food. . Proposed changes that would more clearly identify the origin of food on supermarket shelves, combined with growing pressure on consumers to buy local produce, may curb the appetite for Chinese imports and could undercut a landmark free trade deal. . “I want to make sure I do everything in my power to say to people ‘your safest food is your domestic food’,” Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Wednesday. . Thirteen Australians have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, a viral disease affecting the liver, after eating frozen mixed berries sold by Patties Foods Ltd and health officials expect to identify more cases in coming weeks. . The berries were grown in Chile and China before being packaged at a Chinese factory, where poor hygiene and tainted water supplies are thought to have caused the health problems. Hepatitis A is passed through contact with material that has been contaminated with faeces from an infected person. . The case has given impetus to a bill introduced into the Australian parliament a week ago by the minority opposition Greens Party, which wants more informative labeling on products for sale in Australia.  . Under current laws, the term “made from Australian and imported ingredients” is common, providing no detail on the exact origins of all the ingredients in a product or where it was packaged.  . Imported food products have to undergo less stringent safety tests during and after production than local produce, farmers’ groups say. . Joyce said the weak country-of-origin labeling laws allowed manufacturers to use “sneaky terms” to “earn a premium” on cheaply made products. . Farming and consumer groups say the case highlights long-term food safety problems in China, the third-largest source of Australia’s food imports, where rapid industrialisation has polluted soil and water supplies. Poor hygiene in production and packaging plants is also a big concern. . “The current issue with imported frozen berries highlights the need for clearer country-of-origin labeling, as it appears consumers may have been confused about where they came from,” said Ian Harrison, chief executive of lobby group Australian Made Campaign. . “Buy local” campaigns are increasingly prevalent in Australia and are gaining traction.  . A July 2013 Roy Morgan poll showed more than 60 percent of Australians sometimes bought products because they were made in Australia even when they were more expensive than imported rivals. Only 12 percent said price would deter them from buying Australian products. . Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who late last year signed a free trade deal with China, is less enamoured with changing country-of-origin labeling laws, saying he is wary of imposing new regulations that could send food prices soaring.  . Trade agreements make such changes tricky politically. Australia needs the trade pact with China to help it move from a reliance on exports of coal and iron ore to expanding its food and agricultural shipments to a growing Asian middle class.   . There is also the risk of appearing contradictory. Australia is one of a number of countries that have taken action in the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States after it introduced its own stronger country-of-origin labeling laws for beef products last year.  . Abbott said the government would look at toughening up screening processes for imported goods but put the impetus on the food industry to make its own checks. . Patties Foods has withdrawn the frozen berries from sale and stressed it carried out all the tests required under Australian law but it will probably face a class action lawsuit. Its shares have fallen 10 percent since it announced the product recall over the weekend. |Thu Feb 19 21:17:17 +0000 2015||Tainted Chinese berries may spur reform of Australian food labeling |5.685197164377989e+17|http://reut.rs/1EaPM4B
Steve Gorman|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A large Los Angeles teaching hospital has told scores of patients they were possibly exposed to a drug-resistant bacterial “superbug” during endoscopy procedures that infected seven patients and may have contributed to two deaths. . The 179 patients who may have been infected by the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are being offered home testing kits that would be analyzed by the University of California, Los Angeles, hospital system, UCLA officials said. . The possible exposures occurred at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center between October and January during procedures in which a specialized endoscope is inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. . Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients. . The UCLA hospital system said it had been sterilizing the scopes according to the manufacturer’s standards, but was now using a more rigorous process. . “The two scopes involved with the infection were immediately removed, and UCLA is now utilizing a decontamination process that goes above and beyond manufacturer and national standards,”  it said in the statement.  . UCLA spokeswoman Roxanne Moster said both scopes in question, which the hospital started using in June 2014, had been permanently set aside and would be returned to the manufacturer. . The circumstances of the two deaths of patients known to have been infected at Ronald Reagan Medical Center were not disclosed, nor were the conditions of the five other patients also confirmed to have been infected there. . Officials at the medical center were due to address a news conference later on Thursday.  . UCLA became aware of the outbreak late last month, the Los Angeles Times reported. Both the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and the California Department of Public Health were notified as soon as the bacteria were detected, the UCLA statement said. . Superbug infections are difficult to treat because some of the bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the germs could contribute to death in up to 50 percent of infected patients. . The complex design of the endoscopes linked to the California outbreak, known as duodenoscopes, may hinder proper cleaning, the FDA warned on Thursday.  . The FDA said it wanted to raise awareness among healthcare professionals that the design is associated with a risk of multidrug-resistant infections even when a manufacturer’s cleaning instructions are followed correctly.   . There are three major manufacturers of the scopes: Olympus Corp, Fujifilm, and Pentax. Their disinfection recommendations were approved by the FDA. . Some experts advocate the use of disposable, single-use instruments, rather than reusable ones that must be sterilized after every procedure.  . In January, Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle said that a bacteria spread through contaminated endoscopes had infected 32 people in that facility over two years.   . Eleven of the patients infected from 2012 to 2014 eventually died. Since they were critically ill before being infected, it was unclear if the bacteria played any role in their deaths, health officials said. . Contaminated endoscopes also infected dozens of patients in Pittsburgh in 2012 and Chicago in 2014, health officials said. No fatalities were directly linked to those infections. . “Superbugs” have been linked to 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses every year in the United States, and up to $20 billion in direct healthcare costs. |Thu Feb 19 20:57:07 +0000 2015||"179 patients notified of possible exposure to ""superbug"" at UCLA Medical Center:  http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-PFDf4CcAAeLOA.jpg"|5.68514641925505e+17|http://reut.rs/1G96UXn
Courtney Sherwood|PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Oregon health authorities are investigating whether a bacterial infection related to meningitis killed a college student this week amid an outbreak that has sickened three others at the state’s flagship public university, officials said on Thursday. . University of Oregon student Lauren Jones, 18, died on Tuesday. An autopsy was inconclusive, and state and federal labs will conduct further tests to determine the cause of death, Lane County Public Health Department spokesman Jason Davis said.  . Davis declined to comment on any other possible causes of death. Public health officials are offering antibiotics used against meningococcemia, the bacterial precursor to meningitis, to students who may have come into prolonged contact with Jones. . Jones, a Georgia native who enrolled this fall and was on the Eugene-based school’s acrobatics and tumbling team, was found unresponsive in her dorm room on Tuesday and was later declared dead at a nearby hospital, said university spokeswoman Jen McCulley. . “Our community is grieving about the loss of this vibrant student,” McCulley said. . Three other students at the university had previously been diagnosed with meningococcemia infections, which can also lead to damaging blood infections but can be transmitted only after several hours of exposure. . Of the three students whose infections have been confirmed since January, two were recovering well while a third was facing what Davis called serious health challenges. . The University of Oregon is cooperating with public health officials and is offering students voluntary meningitis vaccines, McCulley said. |Thu Feb 19 20:09:40 +0000 2015||Officials probing if meningitis killed Oregon student amid outbreak |5.685026975545303e+17|http://reut.rs/1EaBHnD
Yasmeen Abutaleb|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Egg and red meat lovers may find reason to rejoice in a decision by a U.S. advisory health panel to remove warnings about dietary cholesterol, saying that there is no link to dangerous levels of blood cholesterol that cause disease. . The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee until now had recommended that cholesterol intake be limited to 300 milligrams per day, about the amount in two eggs. . After reviewing scores of studies that showed no correlation between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol, or “bad” cholesterol present in the blood, the committee determined that cholesterol was not “a nutrient of concern for overconsumption,” it wrote in its report.   . For decades, health and government officials warned against consumption of high-cholesterol foods, such as red meat and eggs, saying they greatly increased the risk of heart disease and obesity. But many doctors and nutritionists now say there is no link between dietary cholesterol and dangerous levels of cholesterol in the blood that cause disease.  . “Many of us for a long time have believed the dietary guidelines were pointing in the wrong direction,” Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said in an interview. “It is long overdue.” . The advisory committee’s report will be used by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to write the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a blueprint that outlines the ideal American diet and is updated every five years.   . In another change of course, the committee recommended three diets that are comprised of more than 30 percent fat: a healthy diet based on U.S. foods, the Mediterranean diet and a vegetarian diet. Several studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet - which emphasizes protein, whole grains and foods high in “good” fats such as olive oil, avocados and nuts - lowers the risk of heart disease.   . As has been the case for years, the report found that most Americans consume too few vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy and whole grains. Most diets are too high in calories and refined grains, such as white breads and pasta, saturated fat, added sugars and salt, the committee wrote.  . The report is followed by a 45-day public comment period, and final guidelines are due later this year.  |Thu Feb 19 19:53:54 +0000 2015||Love to eat eggs?

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – The proportion of people surviving years after a cancer diagnosis is improving, according to a new analysis. . Men and women ages 50 to 64, who were diagnosed in 2005 to 2009 with a variety of cancer types, were 39 to 68 percent more likely to be alive five years later, compared to people of the same age diagnosed in 1990 to 1994, researchers found. . “Pretty much all populations improved their cancer survival over time,” said Dr. Wei Zheng, the study’s senior author from Vanderbilt University in Nashville. . As reported in JAMA Oncology, he and his colleagues analyzed data from a national sample of more than 1 million people who were diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum, breast, prostate, lung, liver, pancreas or ovary between 1990 and 2010. . Among people ages 50 to 64 diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer in 1990 to 1994, about 58 percent were alive five years later. Five-year survival rates were about 83 percent for breast cancer, about 7 percent for liver cancer, about 13 percent for lung cancer, about 5 percent for pancreas cancer, about 91 percent for prostate cancer and about 47 percent for ovarian cancer. . Among people in the same age range diagnosed between 2005 and 2009, a larger proportion survived each of the cancers except ovarian cancer. Survival rates at five years rose by 43 percent for colon or rectum cancers, 52 percent for breast cancer, 39 percent for liver cancer, 68 percent for prostate cancer, 25 percent for lung cancer and 27 percent for pancreas cancer, compared to the early 1990s. . The better odds of survival did not apply equally to all age groups, however, and tended to favor younger patients. For example, survival rose by only 12 to 35 percent for people  diagnosed between ages 75 to 85. . And while there was a small improvement in ovarian cancer survival among white women during the study period, survival among black women with ovarian cancer got worse. . Advances in treatments and better cancer screenings and diagnoses are likely responsible for the overall increases in survival, the researchers write. . “In general our study shows different segments benefit differently from recent advances in oncology,” Zheng said. “We need to find out the reason.” . The researchers speculate that older people may not benefit equally from medical advances, because doctors may avoid aggressive care for them for fear they couldn’t tolerate treatments like surgery or chemotherapy. . Also, older people and racial minorities are less likely to be included in trials of new cancer treatments, the researchers point out. They say more effort should be made to include those groups in trials so doctors have treatment guidelines based on science. . “Additional research is needed to find the reasons why there are gaps,” Zheng said. .

Will Dunham|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Here’s a warning to sunbathers everywhere. Scientists have found that the skin damage caused by UV rays does not stop once you get out of the sun.      . Researchers said on Thursday much of the potentially cancer-causing damage wrought by ultraviolet radiation from sunlight or tanning beds occurs up to three to four hours after exposure thanks to chemical changes involving the pigment melanin. . But there is some good news. The researchers said it may be possible to develop sunscreen that protects against this type of damage. Melanoma, closely linked to UV exposure, accounts for most skin cancer deaths. . The role of melanin, responsible for our skin, eye and hair color, in promoting DNA damage was a surprise because melanin was previously known to play a protective role by absorbing much of the UV energy before it penetrates the skin. . “But the unusual chemical properties of melanin that make it a good UV absorber also make it susceptible to other chemical reactions that just happen to have the same end result as the UV,” said Douglas Brash, a therapeutic radiology and dermatology professor at the Yale School of Medicine whose study appears in the journal Science. . The researchers revealed this aspect of melanin in experiments involving human cells in a lab dish as well as lab mice and mouse cells in a dish. . UV exposure can cause DNA damage that may spur carcinogenic mutations in melanin-producing cells called melanocytes. . The researchers exposed mouse and human melanocytes to radiation from a UV lamp. The cells experienced DNA damage immediately but the damage also continued for hours. In fact, half of the damage occurred in the hours after exposure. . After a type of chemical reaction called chemiexcitation, also witnessed in bioluminescent creatures including fire flies, energy gets transferred to DNA to potentially cause mutations. . “People should be aware of the chemistry initiated in the skin after the UV exposure so that they can take proper care of themselves whenever going out in the sun or to the beach,” said Yale School of Medicine researcher Sanjay Premi. . “We’d like to find new ingredients for sunscreens that will block these reactions,” Brash added. “But in the meantime, I tell people to enjoy the sun but just don’t lie on the beach between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and wear a hat. Sunscreens are useful, too, so long as they block both UVB and UVA,” two kinds of ultraviolet rays. |Thu Feb 19 19:22:23 +0000 2015||Sunbathers take heed: skin damage continues hours after exposure |5.6849080099424666e+17|http://reut.rs/1EaqmUD

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Kids with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep problems showed slight improvement in their symptoms after undergoing a behavioral sleep intervention, Australian researchers say. . The daytime improvement in ADHD symptoms was partly the result of the kids getting a better night’s sleep, and possibly of parents’ learning methods for dealing  with behavior problems, the study found. . “Our previous work found that sleep problems were common in children with ADHD and associated with poorer behavior, ADHD symptoms, quality of life and day-to-day functioning, such as getting ready for school,” said lead author Dr. Harriet Hiscock, a pediatrician at Murdoch Children’s Research at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Victoria. . “We also found that children with ADHD and sleep problems had poorer school attendance and their parents had poorer mental health and work attendance,” Hiscock told Reuters Health in an email. “We wanted to see if we could change some of these outcomes by improving the child’s sleep.” . About five percent of U.S. children have ADHD, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  . For their study, published in The BMJ, Hiscock and colleagues enrolled the families of 244 children aged 5 to 12 with ADHD and sleep problems who attended 21 pediatric clinics in Victoria.  . Half of the families received the intervention, which included two personal consultations with clinicians who had been trained to determine kids’ sleep problems and deliver personalized sleep management programs to the families. The families also had one follow-up phone consultation.  . The intervention included guidance for parents on things like setting children’s bedtimes, establishing routines, avoiding caffeine and keeping electronics out of the bedroom. . The remaining families continued their regular care and served as a comparison group. . Parents in both groups kept sleep diaries and filled out questionnaires about their children’s behavior, sleep problems, quality of life and daily functioning at the beginning of the study and again three and six months later. Parents also answered questions about their own mental health.  . In addition, the children’s teachers filled out ADHD rating scales during the study and kids were tested for working memory, such as the ability to count backwards without losing track.  . The study team found that at both three and six months, the children in the intervention group had a slight improvement in ADHD symptoms, especially for inattentive symptoms. Their sleep difficulties were also reduced more than those of kids in the comparison group. . Along the same lines, teachers reported greater reductions in school-related behavior problems among children in the intervention group at three and six months.  . “Managing behavioral sleep problems in children with ADHD is feasible and highly effective - it improves not only sleep, but also child behavior, ADHD symptoms, quality of life and working memory,” Hiscock said. . Hiscock said that parents could do this on their own but would likely need some support and guidance from a trained health professional.  . “They can certainly take the first steps, i.e., establishing good sleep hygiene by ensuring a bedtime routine, set bedtime and a media-free bedroom,” she said. . Hiscock said she thinks that pediatricians should ask about sleep problems in children with ADHD and offer evidence-based solutions such as the one used in the study. . “I think it adds to the body of literature that suggests that behavioral interventions can be quite efficacious for this group of kids and you don’t necessarily have to treat their insomnia with medication,” Dr. Judith Owens told Reuters Health. . “One thing that was a little different in this study from other studies was that they seemed to find improvements in daytime behavior as well,” said Owens, a sleep medicine specialist at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C. who wasn’t involved in the study. . Parents are often overwhelmed and exhausted by the end of the day and often don’t enforce healthy sleep practices said Owens, who also ran an ADHD clinic for 25 years. . Taking those steps, such as enforcing a regular bedtime, establishing a bedtime routine, and keeping a policy of no electronics in the evening is a good place to start, although it may not fix the problem entirely, she added. . “If you don’t do those basic things then all the rest of the interventions aren’t going to be nearly as successful,” Owens said. .

Alex Whiting|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It is a little known disease but it could make medical history if scientists’ predictions are correct: yaws could completely disappear by 2020, given the right resources. . The only disease ever to have been eradicated is the deadly smallpox. Guinea worm is nearly there, and polio too could be added to the list. . The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday urged developing countries to invest more in tackling so-called neglected tropical diseases such as yaws, saying more investment would alleviate human misery and free people trapped in poverty. . Yaws affects mainly children and causes unsightly skin ulcers and painful bone infections that can make walking difficult. In some rare cases it can eat away people’s noses. . At least 50 million people were affected by the bacterial infection in the 1950s. When the WHO launched mass treatment campaigns with penicillin vaccines, the number of cases plummeted by 95 percent by the end of the 1960s, according to David Mabey, an expert in yaws and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. . “But then it fell off the agenda. And we’re trying to put it back on,” Mabey said in an interview. . Yaws is known to be prevalent in 12 countries in areas where people have little access to healthcare, mainly in West and Central Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands. . It should be easy to eradicate, because scientists have found that a single dose of the relatively cheap drug azithromycin, given orally, is as effective as the penicillin injections of old, Mabey said.  . He was recently part of a team of researchers who were able to confirm this in Papua New Guinea. Their findings were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. . Yaws is one of a group of 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect 1.5 billion people, among them the world’s poorest. They maim or blind people, are often debilitating and sometimes fatal. . “The NTDs are a huge global health priority, and that’s really motivated donors and endemic countries to pull together,” Helen Hamilton, NTD policy advisor at Sightsavers and chair of the UK Coalition against NTDs said in an interview. . Because most NTDs affect only certain geographical areas, experts say that given the right resources many of them can cease to be a public health risk. . But challenges remain. “One of the things that worries me is the sustainability of all of this,” Simon Croft, professor of parasitology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said in an interview. . “It’s not just going to just happen overnight – how do we keep it going when we know the attention of politicians is about three years at best?” he said. . Another concern is that once a disease has been curbed, as happened with leprosy, politicians and health officials put a tick in the box, forget about it, and it comes back, Croft said. . Despite donations of free treatments by drug companies to fight NDTs, not enough money is spent on getting drugs and tools to the people who need them, David Molyneux, professor at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said in an interview. . Less than 1 percent of official international development aid for health is spent on NTDs, Molyneux said. Malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS attract much of the funds.  . Molyneux led a team of scientists that crisscrossed Nigeria checking for guinea worm, declaring the country free of the disease in 2013. He was also involved in a campaign to eliminate river blindness in West Africa. . Bednets, insecticides and free or very cheap drugs can help curb many of the diseases. . “We’re dealing with something here where ... we can have a profound health impact with very cheap tools,” he said.  |Thu Feb 19 15:52:36 +0000 2015||Diseases affecting the poorest can be eliminated, scientists say |5.68438005444309e+17|http://reut.rs/1G7YgZf
Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Effectively monitoring people exposed to Ebola requires more than just checking symptoms. A quarantine plan also needs to help people keep up with work and school and pay for essentials like housing and food, a U.S. report concludes. . To understand the challenges encountered by ordinary citizens exposed to Ebola, a team led by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed concerns raised by people monitored as part of an Ebola cluster in Dallas last year.  . “If yet-to-be-identified contacts notice that those who come forward as Ebola contacts are shunned from society and quarantined in their homes, with no way to provide for themselves and their families, they will be less likely to come forward,” said lead study author Dr. Charnetta Smith, a CDC epidemic intelligence service officer.  . There have been over 23,000 cases of Ebola and more than 9,300 deaths worldwide since the current epidemic began in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization. Most of the cases have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  . Last fall, 179 people needed monitoring for Ebola symptoms after Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national visiting Dallas, became the first person diagnosed with the Ebola virus in the U.S., according to the CDC report. He died in an isolation unit inside a Dallas hospital in October. . Most of the people exposed to the virus in Texas were healthcare workers, including two who became infected with Ebola after treating Duncan. But the group also included 20 people in the community and 10 individuals who rode in the same ambulance that transported Duncan before it was completely cleaned and disinfected, the authors write in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.  . Duncan’s case in Dallas prompted questions about the timeliness of his care. He initially sought treatment two days before being admitted to the hospital, but he was sent home with antibiotics.  . It also raised questions about the best way to monitor people who came in contact with Ebola. In Texas, five “community contacts” and two “ambulance contacts” were formally quarantined, according to Smith. Another 20 health care workers voluntarily self-quarantined. . The CDC recommends that people exposed to Ebola who don’t have any symptoms of the virus be monitored for 21 days. During that period, these individuals may be advised to limit their movements within the community and avoid public transportation. They may be asked to remain at home, missing work and school.  . As these individuals are asked to disrupt their lives, it’s critical that public health officials understand how any restrictions on daily activities may impact their ability to get food, fill prescriptions and get necessary supplies, Smith told Reuters Health.  . In Dallas, the group of people monitored for Ebola symptoms included eight school-aged children, three non-English speakers, two people with complex chronic medical conditions and one homeless individual. Each of these vulnerable populations needed special assistance.  . For example, the children exposed to Ebola missed school. They needed help getting assignments, books and access to computers. They also needed support returning to school at the end of the 21-day monitoring period. . “Physicians from the Dallas County Medical Society volunteered their time to educate administrators, teachers and parents about Ebola,” Smith said. “This helped to minimize stigma and ensure that all students would be welcomed back to their schools.” . Beyond making this type of accommodation, public health officials also need to recognize that Ebola and other infectious diseases can disproportionately impact low-income communities where people have few resources to deal with a quarantine, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  . “Whenever you are dealing with an infectious disease issue you are often dealing with people in the marginalized portions of society,” said Hotez, who wasn’t involved in the CDC report. “Here in Texas, where we often find widespread tropical disease outbreaks, it is almost always the poor and the homeless who are affected.” . Efforts to contain Ebola in Dallas clearly worked because there wasn’t a single transmission in the community, Hotez said. But a 21-day quarantine might not always make sense, particularly for the people who would face extreme financial hardship as a result. . “Twenty one days means that there is a 5 percent or less likelihood that you could still develop Ebola if you don’t have symptoms, but there is also a case to be made that the risk isn’t as great after 14 to 15 days,” Hotez said. “Twenty one days should be questioned.” .

Deena Beasley|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As U.S. drugmakers face growing resistance to the high price of cutting-edge treatments, a handful of companies are working on a new payment model that rewards them for the long-term performance of their medicines.  . The effort, industry executives told Reuters, is being led by firms developing so-called gene therapies, which aim to cure inherited diseases like hemophilia by “fixing” the single faulty gene responsible for the disorder. They include BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc in San Rafael, California, and Sangamo BioSciences Inc in Richmond, California. . If these new hemophilia drugs and others like them succeed,  a one-time infusion could replace the need for frequent, life-long injections of blood clotting proteins that can cost up to $300,000 a year for a single patient. These existing treatments, including Pfizer Inc’s Xyntha and Baxter International’s Advate, are expected to command annual sales of more than $11 billion by 2016. . Drugmakers contend that a one-time cure, even at a price of more than $1 million, would save money over the long term. But there are concerns that health insurers will balk at covering that kind of upfront cost. . “The place that we are moving toward is more of a pay-for-performance type of strategy,” said Edward Lanphier, Sangamo’s chief executive officer. Under this model, the price would be amortized over a period of time and contingent on proof that the treatment is effective and safe.  . The annuity-like payments would be stopped if medical testing, such as the level of clotting protein measured in a patient’s blood sample, showed that the therapy was not working. . Many barriers remain to implementing such a model, and the drugs for which it is being considered may not reach the market for several more years, if at all. Since Americans often switch health insurers, contracts - or even legislation - would be needed to require payers to pick up the ongoing tab for patients who change their coverage. . But the interest in new payment models reflects the healthcare industry’s intention to find new ways to bolster profits as insurers push back against drug prices. Some backers of the new model say the payment streams could eventually be packaged and sold to investors, as happens now with securities backed by financial assets like credit card receivables. . “Our approach to this important funding-benefit question is to establish a financing vehicle where the relatively large upfront cost is amortized in conjunction with the benefit of these innovative, curative or preventative therapies,” said Michael Meyers, managing director and head of investment banking at T.R. Winston & Company, which is discussing such funding models with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. . Dr. Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS Health Corp, the second largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, is supportive of such efforts.  . “Some sort of model where there was a partial payment over time could work well,” Brennan said in an interview. . Gene therapy has been a target of Big Pharma for more than 20 years, but research has been dogged by a series of disappointments and safety concerns. More recent scientific advances have paved the way for the potentially life-changing treatments. . No gene therapies have been approved in the United States, but Europe approved its first gene therapy last year. Glybera treats a rare disorder that clogs the blood with fat and has been cleared for reimbursement in Germany at a price of 850,000 euros, or around $1 million. It will be sold for a one-time payment because it is too difficult to measure how well it works, said Joern Aldag, CEO at Dutch biotech firm UniQure NV, which developed Glybera. . Aldag said gene therapies for larger patient populations in development at UniQure, including hemophilia and congestive heart failure, would likely be priced on an amortized basis.  . “Gene therapy may be an initial very high burden for the healthcare system,” Aldag said. “The general consensus is that asking for a one-off payment of over a million dollars becomes unacceptable.” . U.S. health insurers and other group payers routinely pay annual prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for enzyme replacement therapies for extremely rare, “orphan” diseases. . BioMarin’s Vimizin costs nearly $400,000 per year for a genetic disorder that causes skeletal malformation and other problems.  . But insurers are much less willing to foot that kind of bill for drugs used in large numbers of patients. Last year, they pressured Gilead Sciences Inc to cut the $1,000 per-pill cost of its new hepatitis C drug, saying the cost of treating more than 3 million Americans infected with the virus was unacceptable. Gilead said recently that it is discounting its prices by nearly 50 percent. . About 20,000 Americans are estimated to have hemophilia, which is caused by a defect in a gene carried on the X chromosome. . “Distributing reimbursement over many years recognizes the fact that we don’t know how long these (gene therapy treatments) are going to last,” said Dr James Wilson, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania. |Thu Feb 19 12:18:42 +0000 2015||Paying for gene therapy: are annuities the next big thing? |5.6838417597743514e+17|http://reut.rs/1E96Qb4
Steve Gorman|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A large Los Angeles teaching hospital has told scores of patients they were possibly exposed to a drug-resistant bacterial “superbug” during endoscopy procedures that infected seven patients and may have contributed to two deaths. . The 179 patients who may have been infected by the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are being offered home testing kits that would be analyzed by the University of California, Los Angeles, hospital system, UCLA officials said. . The possible exposures occurred at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center between October and January during procedures in which a specialized endoscope is inserted down the throat to diagnose and treat pancreatic and bile duct diseases. . Hospitals across the United States have reported exposures from the same type of medical equipment in recent years, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it was working with other government agencies and scope manufacturers to minimize risks to patients. . The UCLA hospital system said it had been sterilizing the scopes according to the manufacturer’s standards, but was now using a more rigorous process. . “The two scopes involved with the infection were immediately removed, and UCLA is now utilizing a decontamination process that goes above and beyond manufacturer and national standards,”  it said in the statement.  . UCLA spokeswoman Roxanne Moster said both scopes in question, which the hospital started using in June 2014, had been permanently set aside and would be returned to the manufacturer. . The circumstances of the two deaths of patients known to have been infected at Ronald Reagan Medical Center were not disclosed, nor were the conditions of the five other patients also confirmed to have been infected there. . Officials at the medical center were due to address a news conference later on Thursday.  . UCLA became aware of the outbreak late last month, the Los Angeles Times reported. Both the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and the California Department of Public Health were notified as soon as the bacteria were detected, the UCLA statement said. . Superbug infections are difficult to treat because some of the bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the germs could contribute to death in up to 50 percent of infected patients. . The complex design of the endoscopes linked to the California outbreak, known as duodenoscopes, may hinder proper cleaning, the FDA warned on Thursday.  . The FDA said it wanted to raise awareness among healthcare professionals that the design is associated with a risk of multidrug-resistant infections even when a manufacturer’s cleaning instructions are followed correctly.   . There are three major manufacturers of the scopes: Olympus Corp, Fujifilm, and Pentax. Their disinfection recommendations were approved by the FDA. .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization called on developing countries on Thursday to invest $1 per person per year until 2030 to tackle 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and improve the health and well-being of more than 1.5 billion people. . Forecasting a total of $34 billion needed to fight NTDs for  the next 16 years, the WHO said governments whose people are blinded, disfigured and killed by such diseases should recognize the great potential human and economic return on tackling them. . “Increased investments by national governments can alleviate human misery, distribute economic gains more evenly and free masses of people long trapped in poverty,” WHO director-general Margaret Chan said in a report.  . The investment would represent as little as 0.1 percent of current national health spending of the low and middle-income countries affected by NTDs, the WHO said, and could also encourage international donors to increase aid. . NTDs such as river blindness, rabies, guinea worm and elephantiasis cause disfigurement, disability and death among millions of poor people in developing countries. . Also among the 17 being targeted by the WHO are Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness — a parasitic infection spread by tsetse flies that is almost 100 percent fatal without prompt diagnosis and treatment — and dengue, sometimes known as “breakbone fever” — a mosquito-borne disease that in its severe form can cause lethal complications. . Dirk Engels, the WHO’s director of NTD control, told Reuters that while NTDs often affect the poorest people in a country, many of those nations where they are endemic are middle-income economies where growth is accelerating. . “Endemic countries can play their part,” he said in an interview in London. “Some endemic countries are fast developing, and as they move up the ladder they also have more means to pay for tackling NTDs.” . The WHO report noted some progress, for example against Dracunculiasis, or guinea-worm disease, of which there were just 126 cases reported in 2014 compared to almost 1,800 in 2010 and 3.5 million in the mid-1980s. . “Eradication of this disease is achievable with continued effort and investment,” it said. . Engels also said the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa in the past year highlighted to developing countries the risk of doing nothing to tackle diseases often ignored by unaffected wealthy countries. . “Ebola has shown that when there is real urgency, something can be done (by foreign donors and pharmaceutical companies),” he said. “But it’s also shown that maybe we shouldn’t wait until it is urgent.”|Thu Feb 19 05:19:58 +0000 2015||WHO urges developing countries to fund tropical diseases fight |5.682788004690002e+17|http://reut.rs/1G60gRW
|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Seven patients were infected with a potentially deadly, drug-resistant bacteria at UCLA’s Ronald Reagan Medical Center and more than 100 may have been exposed to the so-called superbug, the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday. . The patients were exposed to the CRE bacteria at the Los Angeles hospital between October and January, the Times said in a story on its website that cited university officials. The bug may have contributed to the deaths of two patients, the paper reported. . Representatives for the medical center could not be reached for comment by Reuters after hours on Wednesday. . According to the Times, UCLA became aware late last month of the outbreak, which may have been spread by a specialized endoscope inserted down the throat, and has begun to notify patients.  . The university also immediately notified public health officials, the paper said, and the infected scopes were removed from use. |Thu Feb 19 03:36:21 +0000 2015||Hundreds possibly exposed to 'superbug' at UCLA Medical Center |5.6825272369669325e+17|http://reut.rs/1G5G2rr
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Public health officials said on Wednesday that six more cases of measles had been confirmed in California, bringing to 119 the total number of people infected by a strain of the virus that has also been linked to a large outbreak in the Philippines. . More than 150 people across the United States have been diagnosed with measles, many of them linked to the wave of illness that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December. . California Department of Public Health researchers, in a report to federal officials released on Friday, said that specimens from 30 of the state’s measles patients had been genotyped and that all were of the same strain that has caused an outbreak in the Philippines. . That same genotype has been detected in at least 14 countries and six other U.S. states in the last six months, the researchers said, and the source of the illness that sickened visitors at the Disney theme park has not been identified. . The Disneyland resort, located in Anaheim in Southern California, receives millions of visitors a year, many of them coming from overseas.  . The report posted on the website of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak illustrates the need for high measles vaccine rates in the United States. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons. . According to the CDPH, 39 of the 119 people who contracted measles in the state were believed to have been exposed while visiting Disneyland. An additional 35 had contacts with those people in a household or community setting. . The state health department said another 45 cases have an unknown exposure source but are presumed linked to the Disneyland outbreak based on a combination of descriptive epidemiology or strain type. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. . Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.  |Thu Feb 19 02:08:43 +0000 2015||California confirms 119 cases of measles in state |5.682306715352269e+17|http://reut.rs/1E7L4V9
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Global progress toward tackling obesity has been “unacceptably slow”, health experts said on Wednesday, with only one in four countries implementing a policy on healthy eating before 2010. . In a series of studies published in The Lancet medical journal, researchers said that in less than a generation, rates of child obesity have risen dramatically worldwide, yet few countries have taken regulatory steps to protect children or implemented recommended healthy food policies. . “Our understanding of obesity must be completely reframed if we are to halt and reverse the global obesity epidemic,” said Christina Roberto of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who worked on one of the studies.     . “On one hand, we need to acknowledge that individuals bear some responsibility for their health, and on the other hand recognize that today’s food environments exploit people’s biological, psychological, social and economic vulnerabilities, making it easier for them to eat unhealthy foods.” . According to World Health Organization data, 39 percent of adults worldwide were overweight in 2014, and 13 percent were obese. Some 42 million children under the age of five were overweight or obese in 2013. . New data in The Lancet series suggest children in the United States consume an average of 200kcal per day more than they did in the 1970s — equivalent to $400-worth of food per child per year, or $20 billion a year for the U.S. food industry. . Tim Lobstein of the World Obesity Federation, a co-researcher on the series, argued that the food industry has a special interest in targeting children, since repeated exposure to processed foods and sweetened drinks in infancy builds taste preferences, brand loyalty and high profits. . “Fat children are an investment in future sales,” he said, adding that this year the global market for processed infant foods is seen at $19 billion, up from $13.7 billion in 2007. . The researchers called for tighter supervision and regulation of the food supply, including an international code of food marketing to protect children’s health; regulating food nutritional quality in schools; taxes on unhealthy products; subsidies for healthy foods for poorer families; and mandatory food labeling to prompt industry to produce healthier foods. |Wed Feb 18 23:51:17 +0000 2015||"Global progress against obesity ""unacceptably slow"" "|5.681960849143685e+17|http://reut.rs/1G4OIhH
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – For older people who have some trouble getting around, even light activity like household chores may be better for the heart than no activity, according to a new U.S. study. . Researchers profiled seniors’ risk of heart disease complications - including heart attack - over a 10-year period and found their risk rose along with the amount of time they were inactive each day. Conversely, the more active time they had - regardless of intensity - the lower their risk. . “If you can spend less of your time being sedentary and just incorporate more activity – even light activity - in your day that can translate to benefits,” said Thomas Buford, the study’s senior author, from the University of Florida in Gainesville. . Buford and his colleagues from several institutions write in the Journal of the American Heart Association that physical activity is one of the best ways for people to improve their health and decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and its complications. . Most of the studies suggesting physical activity focus on vigorous- or moderate-intensity activity, which may be unrealistic for some older people, especially those who have trouble getting up, moving around or balance issues, Buford said. . The researchers used data from a national trial that previously found physical activity helps people between 70 and 89 years old with mobility problems retain their ability to get around (see Reuters Health story of May 27, 2014 here: . ) . The participants’ activity levels were measured at the start of the trial by a device known as an accelerometer. Then researchers used a standard risk-factor checklist - including age, cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking status - to assess each person’s likelihood of having heart complications over the next 10 years. . The researchers found that, on average, the 1,170 participants spent about 77 percent of their time being inactive. The majority of their remaining time was spent doing light activities like household chores. . Based on their calculations, the average risk of the participants having a complication from heart disease over the next 10 years was about 13 percent. . Overall, the seniors’ 10-year risk of complications from heart disease increased by about 1 percent for every 25 to 30 minutes they spent being inactive per day. . The risk of those same complications also decreased by about the same amount with every minute spent being active, even if that meant just moving around the house and doing chores. . “We need to follow up on this data more, but it’s promising to say maybe incorporating more of these light activities and sitting less is tied to cardiovascular benefits,” Buford said. . One of the limitations of the study is that the results don’t prove that inactivity causes heart attacks or other complications from heart disease, the researchers write. . “I think the study kind of confirms what we’ve always believed,” said Dr. David Frid, who was not involved with the research. “As everybody gets older, we know their cardiovascular risk goes up and the more active they remain it’s going to reduce their overall cardiovascular risk.” . In general though, older people can try to be a bit more active, but they should check with their doctor before starting an exercise program that involves things like running on a treadmill or pedaling a bike, said Frid, a cardiologist in the Cleveland Clinic’s Section of Preventive Cardiology. . “Just getting up and walking a bit more or doing a little more housework shouldn’t’ be that much of an increased medical risk,” he said. .

|ABIDJAN (Reuters) - West Africa recorded 128 new confirmed cases of Ebola in the week to Feb. 15, the first decrease in three weeks, but resistance in some communities threatened efforts to end the epidemic, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . Guinea reported 52 new confirmed cases, its first week-to-week decline since Jan. 25. Sierra Leone saw 74 new cases, 45 of which were in the capital Freetown. Liberia reported 2 new confirmed cases in the four days to Feb. 12. . Despite the encouraging data concerning new transmissions, health workers continued to face challenges, the WHO said in its weekly report. . “Each of the three countries reported an increase in security incidents related to the Ebola response compared with the previous week,” the report said, referring to an upswing in the number of threats and violence against health workers. . Guinea and Sierra Leone also combined to report 84 unsafe burials. Over 40 new confirmed cases were identified through testing after individuals had died in the community, away from treatment facilities, raising the risk of further transmission. . West Africa’s year-long Ebola outbreak has now killed at least 9,365 people from among 23,218 cases recorded, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. |Wed Feb 18 22:48:24 +0000 2015||Ebola cases fall in West Africa, but challenges remain: WHO |5.68180257385259e+17|http://reut.rs/1E7dkXV
Michael Fleeman|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Healthcare activists critical of adult film industry practices are working to put a measure before California voters next year to require porn actors to use condoms during film production, expanding a Los Angeles County rule that survived a legal challenge. . The proposed ballot measure, aimed at protecting actors from sexually transmitted diseases, would require film companies to be licensed by the state and would impose fines of $70,000 for offenders. It would also allow actors to sue producers who violate the rule, supporters said on Wednesday. . Under a final draft of the measure filed with the state on Tuesday, film companies would have to post warning signs visible to performers stating that California law requires condom use for “all acts of vaginal or anal intercourse during the production of adult films.” . “We’re trying to protect both performers as well as those who would interact with performers and keep everybody safer as a result of safe sex,” said Bradley Hertz, an attorney for the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is sponsoring the measure. . Backers of the measure must obtain 365,880 signatures by September to qualify it for the November 2016 ballot, and signature-gathering may begin after a month-long comment period.      . The proposal is similar to a condom mandate approved by Los Angeles County voters in 2012 and upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals following objections by the adult film industry. . The industry trade group, the Free Speech Coalition, opposes condom requirements, saying they could drive film production underground or to other states and that the industry’s own health protections are effective.  . “The people in our industry are the most highly tested folks out there. It’s much safer to be an adult performer than to be just a single person out at the bars,” said Diane Duke, chief executive officer of the Free Speech Coalition.  . The coalition oversees testing of performers for HIV and maintains a pass-fail database of about 6,000 people. It says  there have been no documented cases of HIV transmission in sex scenes by professional actors in the database in over a decade. . But in Nevada, health officials said last month they were considering imposing regulations, similar to those on the books for the state’s legal brothels, after two male performers tested positive for HIV following a shoot there. The Free Speech Coalition says those performers were not in its database. |Wed Feb 18 22:48:23 +0000 2015||Activists seek to put porn actor condom requirement on California ballot |5.681802553636168e+17|http://reut.rs/1G4xkJO
Rod Nickel|WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Canadian beef cow infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy was born on an Alberta farm in 2009, two years after the federal government imposed tougher animal feed restrictions, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said on Wednesday. . Canada confirmed its first case of BSE, also called mad cow disease, since 2011 on Friday. The CFIA has said no part of the animal reached the human food or animal feed systems. . BSE is a progressive, fatal neurological disease believed to be spread when cattle eat protein rendered from the brains and spines of infected cattle or sheep. Canada, the world’s eighth-largest beef exporter, banned that practice in 1997. . The CFIA tightened feed rules further in 2007 and no cattle born after that date have been confirmed with BSE until now. . Canada’s discovery of a case born after feed restrictions took effect is not unique among countries that have imposed similar measures after discovering BSE, said Paul Mayers, CFIA vice-president of policy and program. . The CFIA is investigating the cause and is not ready to slaughter and test other cows, Mayers said. . The March 2009 birth date also pushes back the earliest date Canada can apply to upgrade its international risk status by five years, to 2020, said Martine Dubuc, CFIA’s vice-president of science. BSE risk status, set by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), is a factor in countries determining from which markets they buy beef. . OIE, based in Paris, requires countries to wait 11 years from the birth date of the most recent diseased cow to apply for upgraded status.  . Canada’s BSE risk status is currently ‘controlled,’ a notch below the United States, Australia, Brazil and other countries that have ‘negligible’ status.  . South Korea on Saturday halted imports of Canadian beef as it seeks more information. Indonesia on Wednesday halted imports of non-edible byproducts, such as bone meal, from Canada, CFIA said. .

Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) – A study of mouth microbes finds that antibacterial toothpaste and mouthwash with essential oils work much better in combination than separately to banish bacteria that cause gum disease. . Researchers looked at bacteria clinging to wires used in dental retainers that are bonded to the backs of teeth. These retainers are known to host bacterial colonies that promote bleeding and receding gums as well as cavities.  . “Bonded retainers are very commonly used and are a very effective form of retention,” said Marije Jongsma, who led the study. “Since the retainers usually stay in place for an extended period of time, it is very important to find a way to minimize these adverse effects.”	 . Plaque and bacterial colonies called biofilms tend to accumulate on retainer wires, and antibacterial products help but they don’t eliminate the harmful bacteria, Jongsma’s team writes in the International Journal of Oral Science.  . Jongsma and her colleagues at the University of Groningen and University Medical Center in the Netherlands tested three types of toothpaste and a mouth rinse, in combinations and separately, to understand their effects on the size and makeup of biofilms living on retainer wires in human volunteers. . The study included 22 adults wearing either single-strand or multi-strand wired retainers, which were bonded to the mouth side of the top front teeth. For the experiments, volunteers brushed a minimum of twice daily with a manual toothbrush.  . They were separated into three groups, one assigned to a toothpaste without antibacterial properties and the others assigned to antibacterial toothpastes containing either stannous fluoride or triclosan.  . After a week of using toothpaste alone, the groups took six weeks off, then used their assigned toothpaste for another week, this time with a mouth rinse containing essential oils (Cool Mint Listerine). . After each of the weeks when volunteers used their assigned products, their retainer wires were removed and researchers analyzed the living and dead bacteria on the wires. . Overall, multi-strand wires accumulated more bacteria than single-strand wires, probably because the microbes sheltered in the gaps between strands, the authors note.  . When volunteers used a toothpaste without antimicrobial ingredients, however, there were more live bacteria remaining on single-strand wires than on multistrand wires, regardless of whether mouth rinse was used. The study team points out that on single-strand wires the bacteria are better exposed to nutrients, and that may be why they appeared to thrive. . Using antibacterial toothpaste alone did not much affect the total number of bacteria on the wires, but it did significantly reduce the proportion of living microbes.  . Using antibacterial toothpaste together with the mouth rinse left the smallest number of bacteria and the lowest proportion of living bacteria. Importantly, that combination also produced a shift in the bacterial population. Cavity-causing Streptococcus mutans, for example, went from 30% to 5% of the biofilm’s makeup. . “The results show that after the use of oral antimicrobials, a shift occurs in the composition of the oral biofilm in a more healthy direction. Several species that can cause caries such as S. Mutans and Lactobacillus, decrease in prevalence, whereas the more harmless species increase in prevalence,” said Jongsma, a doctoral student in orthodontics, in an email. . The researchers think the antibacterial toothpastes may slightly alter the properties of the bacterial cell walls in a way that makes them more likely to cling to the oil-containing mouth rinse and be washed away. . Mannish Valiathan, associate professor of orthodontics at the Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, said the findings were similar to those of other studies of retainer biofilms but a reminder of the importance of oral hygiene, particularly for people wearing the devices. . “While oral hygiene should be kept up by all, individuals with fixed retainers may benefit from a regimen designed for them by their care provider followed by periodic monitoring of the oral health status,” said Valiathan, who was not involved in the study, in an email. . Jongsma said she doesn’t think everyone wearing retainers needs to contact the dentist. “However, if your dentist notices . . . you have some difficulties cleaning your retainer, leading to gingivitis around the wire, it might be a good idea to talk to your dentist about using an antimicrobial toothpaste and mouth rinse,” she said. . She notes that her group’s study did not examine whether the antibacterial toothpaste and mouth rinse combination led to less gum disease or cavities over time. . “The results are very promising . . . However, before real recommendations can be made, it should be verified if the antibacterial regimes actually lead to less gingivitis and caries in the clinical situation,” Jongsma said. .

Jonathan Kaminsky|(Reuters) - Mississippi asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to review a lower court decision blocking a law that would shut the state’s sole abortion clinic. . Mississippi is among several states that have passed laws requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics. Some of the measures are under court review. . A federal district court judge issued a temporary injunction in 2012 blocking the Mississippi law because it would have forced women seeking abortions to go out of state. The same judge issued a second injunction in 2013, which was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last November. . The Mississippi Attorney General’s Office argued in its filing that the U.S. Supreme Court should weigh in on whether closing Mississippi’s sole abortion clinic places an undue burden on women seeking the procedure when it is available in adjoining states. . A spokeswoman for Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat, declined to comment on the petition. . Abortion rights advocates urged the high court not to take the case. . “The Court should decline to review the sound determination that Mississippi women would be irreparably harmed if the state were allowed to close its last clinic,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. . Abortion rights supporters say the law in Mississippi and similar ones elsewhere impose medically unnecessary requirements targeting providers of the procedure. . Anti-abortion advocates have countered they are intended to protect women’s health, although some have also said they would likely shutter clinics. . If the high court does not review the case, abortion rights advocates expect it to move forward at the trial court later this year.  |Wed Feb 18 21:49:45 +0000 2015||Mississippi asks Supreme Court to review ruling blocking abortion law |5.681654987116257e+17|http://reut.rs/1G4h3Vu
|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A measles outbreak that has sickened at least 113 people in California after surfacing at a Disneyland resort involves a virus strain that also caused an outbreak in the Philippines, but it is too early to tell if the two waves of illness are related, health officials said. . The measles outbreak that began in late December renewed a debate about some parents’ decisions to not vaccinate their children over fears about potential side effects of vaccines,  which were largely fueled by now-debunked research suggesting the inoculations have a link to autism. . California Department of Public Health researchers, in a report to federal officials released on Friday, said the source of the illness that sickened visitors at the Disney theme park in December has not been identified. . “Specimens from 30 California patients were genotyped; all were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least six U.S. states in the last six months,” the report stated. . The Disneyland resort, located in Anaheim in Southern California, receives millions of visitors a year with many of them coming from overseas.  . The report posted on the website of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak illustrates the need for high measles vaccine rates in the United States. . On Tuesday, California public health officials urged residents to vaccinate themselves and their children before traveling internationally over spring school break. |Wed Feb 18 19:37:07 +0000 2015||California measles outbreak possibly linked to Philippines, officials say |5.681321189178532e+17|http://reut.rs/1E6BSQP
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – In a new Swedish study, kids diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were more likely than their healthy siblings to develop a psychiatric disorder or to attempt suicide. . “We suspected that we would find higher risk of common psychiatric disorders such as depression or anxiety, as observed among adults with diabetes,” said lead author Agnieszka Butwicka of the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. . “What was surprising was that risk was high for many different psychiatric disorders,” which may mean that applying the results of adult studies to kids is too simplistic, she told Reuters Health by email. . More than 200,000 kids in the U.S. had diabetes in 2012, according to the National Diabetes Education Program, and most of them had type 1, which results from the body not producing enough insulin.  . The condition, previously known as juvenile diabetes, is often diagnosed early in life. People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections every day to regulate their blood sugar, and past research has shown that managing the disease is stressful for kids, especially in the period right after they are diagnosed.  . Butwicka and her colleagues used a national register to compare more than 17,000 children with diabetes born in Sweden between 1973 and 2009 with more than 1,000,000 similar but healthy kids, as well as with the healthy siblings of the diabetic group. They looked in medical records for diagnoses of common psychiatric disorders, such as depression, suicide attempt, anxiety, eating disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism or other behavioral problems. . About 8 percent of kids with type 1 diabetes were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Those with diabetes were twice as likely to receive a psychiatric diagnosis by age 18 as kids without the condition, and 1.7 times more likely to attempt suicide, according to the results in Diabetes Care.  . The increased risk for psychiatric disorders was highest for kids born between 1973 and 1986, and then declined. That may indicate that progress in diabetes care and offering more flexible life styles and more effective metabolic control may also lower the psychological burden in diabetes, Butwicka said.  . Some have argued that the increased incidence of autism among kids with diabetes may be genetic, so their siblings would also be more likely to have the disorder. However the researchers found only a slight increased risk for psychiatric disorders among siblings, and no significant increase in any specific category of disorder.  . That suggests the psychological disorders among kids with diabetes may be a result of physiological effects of coping with diabetes rather than a genetic risk factor or family environment, the authors write.  . “I think our results could be replicable in other countries with similar access to pediatric diabetes and mental health care with the possibility of access to those data,” Butwicka said.  . Most doctors probably don’t tell parents of kids with diabetes that their child may be at risk for mental health issues, she said.  . A previous study in Norway found that teens with type 1 diabetes are twice as likely to die before age 30 compared to the general population, and accidents and suicides caused most of the deaths, according to Dr. Maurizio Pompili, director of the Suicide Prevention Center at Sant’Andrea Hospital and Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.  . “Patients with (type 1 diabetes) have almost doubled risk of depression compared to the general population, and psychiatric symptoms are frequent in patients with (type 1 diabetes) and other autoimmune diseases,” Pompili, who was not involved in the research, told Reuters Heath by email. . Kids with diabetes should be screened for depression, though not all will need treatment, he said.  . Physiological changes in the chronic course of type 1 diabetes, including weight gain, pain, hypertension, heart disease, loss of motor skills, or blindness directly affect the emotional state, said Ana Claudia Ornelas, a psychologist at the Institute of Psychiatry/Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, who also was not involved in the new study. . “Children with diabetes and their parents are already afraid of many other complications,” Butwicka said. Parents should know that type 1 diabetes may include psychological implications, and know where to seek help if needed.  . But more than 80 percent of kids in the youngest cohort of the new study had no psychiatric diagnosis, she noted. . “Having diabetes does not immediately mean that one has a psychiatric disorder and requires mental health treatment,” she said. “Amazingly, most children and their parents actually do well.” .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - Despite research suggesting that multivitamins do little for reasonably well-fed Americans, the question is not settled say researchers from the National Institutes of Health. . A new analysis of deaths from heart disease over more than 20 years finds that women who took multivitamin-mineral supplements for three years or more were significantly less likely to die. . The authors urge caution because the benefit was not seen among men using the supplements long-term, among women taking them for less than three years or in anyone taking just multivitamins without minerals.  . “It’s way too early to really know if use of multivitamin-minerals over time reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality (or any other health problem or cause of death) in women,” Regan Bailey, who led the study, told Reuters Health in an email. . “Our study suggests the possibility that there is such a connection for women, which is an interesting finding but to know for sure would require a clinical trial,” said Bailey, a registered dietitian and researcher at the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements. . According to that office, multivitamin-mineral (MVM) products account for almost one-fifth of all purchases of dietary supplements and more than 40% of all sales of vitamin and mineral supplements. More than one-third of Americans take MVMs, spending about $ 5.5 billion each year on them.  . Bailey said many health behaviors, such as eating nutritiously, exercising regularly and not smoking clearly reduce the risk of developing heart disease and dying from it.  . “Taking a multivitamin-mineral should not be a replacement for any of these behaviors,” she said. “And it’s not clear whether taking a multivitamin-mineral added to a healthy lifestyle is going to provide an additional health advantage.” . For their study, online now in The Journal of Nutrition, Bailey’s team analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, conducted between 1988 and 1994.  . Information on multivitamin or multivitamin-mineral use was available for almost 9,000 healthy adults, who were 40 years and older when they answered the surveys. About 21% of those participants who took dietary supplements used MVMs - defined as three or more vitamins plus one or more minerals – and 14% used multivitamins without minerals. . The researchers followed the participants for an average of 18 years to find out how many died of cardiovascular disease.  . Women who had been taking multivitamin-mineral dietary supplements for at least three years when they answered the survey had a 35% lower risk of dying from heart disease over the following decades when compared to women who did not use the supplements.  . The results held after researchers adjusted for other factors that could influence the womens’ heart risks, including weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, alcohol or aspirin use, blood sugar control, education, age and race. . They acknowledge that it’s possible there were other aspects of health and behavior by women who took MVMs over the long-term that the study could not account for.   . Another limitation, the study team writes, is only having responses about supplement use at the beginning of the study.  . “We can’t be sure that the people continued their same supplementation practices over the average 18 years of follow-up,” Bailey said.  . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed independent panel, concluded in 2013 that there isn’t enough evidence showing a heart benefit from multivitamin products to recommend taking them. Bailey and her coauthors note that the panel only had two randomized controlled trials on which to base their conclusions. . Dr. Benjamin Baechler, a physician at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who practices integrative medicine, called the new study’s results thought provoking.  . “When it comes to a daily supplement, this study suggests making a distinction between a product that only has vitamins and those that also have minerals,” he said. . Dr. Saverio Stranges, from the University of Warwick Medical School in Coventry, UK, said that stratifying the findings by gender was fine because men and women have different biology to some degree, but added that observational studies such as this one cannot prove cause and effect. . These findings are “not really in line with trial evidence which does not support the use of supplements for the purposes of cardiovascular disease prevention,” said Stranges, who has studied the use of MVMs. . Stranges said surveys show that supplement users in the U.S. tend to be better educated about healthy lifestyle habits so it’s possible that women who use MVM long term are just healthier in general.  . “So this could also be a marker for other healthy behaviors which actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality,” he said. .

|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans who have started enrolling for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act can still sign up, and the U.S. government is weighing whether to open a special enrollment period for those who missed Sunday’s deadline, the health secretary said on Wednesday. . So far, 11.4 million Americans have enrolled in private health insurance through the health reform law known as Obamacare during the open enrollment period that ended on Sunday, according to the White House.   . The Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to have health insurance or face a financial penalty. But some people may not realize they face a penalty for not having coverage until they file their tax returns in coming weeks. . HHS will decide within the next two weeks whether to allow another special enrollment period for consumers, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters in response to a question about those consumers amid the looming April 15 tax-filing deadline.  . “We’re going to analyze it, we’re going to think about it, and we’ll be back. And we will be back quickly on it,” she said at a news conference. . Separately, Burwell said fewer than 150,000 people were “in line” as of Sunday to get health insurance coverage through the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act. They will have until Feb. 22 to complete their application, she said. . Those applicants were in communication with the telephone call center for the federal exchange marketplace but could not complete their application before Sunday’s deadline, according to HHS. They do not include people who had technical issues with the healthcare.gov website that prevented them from completing their enrollment, the department said. |Wed Feb 18 17:03:56 +0000 2015||Consumers 'in line' for Obamacare can still enroll by Feb. 22: HHS' Burwell |5.680935690026762e+17|http://reut.rs/1G2Vvsh
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded the authorized use of Celgene Corp’s cancer drug Revlimid to include newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, the company said on Wednesday. . Previously the drug was only approved for patients who had received at least one previous therapy. Physicians in the United States have long been prescribing Revlimid for new patients on an “off-label” basis, but the company had not been allowed to promote its use in this population. . The FDA’s action means Celgene can market Revlimid, in combination with a different drug, dexamethasone, as a treatment for all multiple myeloma patients and helps validate the company’s premise that treating patients earlier and for a longer period of time increases progression-free survival. . The approval is expected to only modestly increase sales in the United States since doctors are already prescribing the drug for newly diagnosed patients. . In Europe, where physicians are not allowed to prescribe off-label, the situation is different. Celgene expects European regulators to also approve the drug for newly-diagnosed patients within the next few weeks. If they do, the move could add meaningfully to sales. . About 50 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are newly diagnosed. The remainder have received one or more prior therapies. . Revlimid generated total sales in 2014 of $2.92 billion in the United States and $2.06 billion in the rest of the world. The drug is approved in 70 countries for previously treated patients. The company hopes approvals in the U.S. and Europe will pave the way for other countries to also approve the drug for newly diagnosed patients. . John Newman, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a research note that he expects sales of Revlimid to reach $10 billion by 2020. . About 93,600 patients are living with multiple myeloma in Europe and about 88,499 patients are living with it in the United States, Celgene said. . Revlimid is also approved in the United States and some other countries for a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes. It is also approved in the United States for patients with mantle cell lymphoma whose disease has progressed after two prior therapies. . Celgene’s shares were up 1.4 percent to $117.96 in Wednesday morning trade on Nasdaq. |Wed Feb 18 16:16:42 +0000 2015||FDA approves new use for Celgene's cancer drug Revlimid |5.680816822193234e+17|http://reut.rs/1E5ZHIA
Janice Neumann| (This Feb 12 story corrects paragraph 9, clarifies the relation between anger level and tumor necrosis factor in the study group) . By Janice Neumann . (Reuters Health) - Women caring for partners with traumatic brain injury (TBI) experience enough grief and stress to put their own health at risk, according to a small study of U.S. veterans’ wives and girlfriends. . Anger, blame and grief for the loss of the man they once knew were linked to elevated inflammation levels that raise the women’s risk for chronic disease, researchers say, and not being able to turn to their loved one for support only makes things worse. . “You think about your spouse or significant other and that is such a meaningful relationship and usually the person you go to when you are under stress,” said Karen Saban, of the Loyola University Chicago Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, who led the study. “Here they are going through this very stressful situation but they’ve kind of lost their main person to get support from.” . Saban, who is also a research health scientist at the Edward Hines Jr. Veteran’s Administration Hospital in Hines, Illinois, noted that the women could be finding it particularly difficult to cope because they are relatively young, still working and raising children.  . Past research shows a link between grief and physical health problems like high blood pressure and coronary artery disease, Saban and her colleagues write in Biological Research for Nursing. Chronic stress and depression also puts caregivers at increased risk of inflammation-related illnesses, they note. . Since the year 2000, Saban’s team writes, 244,217 veterans have been diagnosed with the TBI, considered moderate or severe in 43,000 of those cases. The injury can cause seizures, lack of coordination, weakness and cognitive problems. . Researchers analyzed data on 40 women recruited for a larger national study on caregivers from a Veterans Administration trauma clinic, social networking sites and by sending letters to veterans’ homes. . The women, caring for a husband or domestic partner who had TBI within the previous 10 years, answered questions about their levels of grief, stress and depression. They also gave saliva samples, which were used to measure tumor necrosis factor, a protein that signals stress and immune responses. . Based on the womens’ responses, Saban’s team found that caregivers who felt 35 percent more anger than average in the group also also had 25 percent more tumor necrosis factor. . The women caregivers felt the same type of grief experienced by people whose loved ones have died, but it was their levels of anger and blame – which are a part of grief – that were key to the higher levels of inflammation-promoting tumor necrosis factor, according to the results. . “Some anger is probably very normal for caregivers, but I think it’s a difficult emotion to express and, in particular, these caregivers of vets who had a war injury may feel even more guilty,” Saban told Reuters Health. “That feeling may be inducing some of these chemical changes that may set them up for chronic inflammation and possibly chronic disease in the future.” . Rebecca Utz, a sociologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, said the study offered several important reminders about the complexities of grief, loss and the physiological responses they can cause.   . “A person does not have to die to experience a loss,” said Utz, who was not involved in the study. “TBI represents a major redefinition of the person’s identity, functioning and relationship to others. This redefinition is the loss that caregivers are experiencing,” she said. . The study demonstrates that caregivers may be at increased risk for mental health issues and inflammation-related illnesses, Utz added.   . “Their stress has real physical health outcomes, which may alter or reduce their ability to provide caregiving. This has implications on the longevity and staying-power of caregivers, especially those that are expected to provide long duration of caregiving,” she said. . Utz noted that the study should have better explained the blame and anger that the women felt and how it was associated with grief, mental health problems and inflammatory responses. . Saban said therapy could offer caregivers both social support and coping mechanisms. . “Getting beyond feeling the stress and burden, there are ways that perhaps people can reframe how they’re looking at the situation over time . . . saying, ‘I am really making a difference in this person’s life,’” Saban said. .

Ludwig Burger|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany is looking to encourage the development of more powerful antibiotics against the growing threat of drug-resistant superbugs, the country’s pharmaceutical industry association said on Wednesday. . The health ministry in Berlin is to hold talks later this year with Germany’s pharma lobby VFA, which will propose loosely modeling any new rules for antibiotics on the so-called orphan drug status that is awarded to experimental treatments of rare diseases, VFA’s chairman Hagen Pfundner said. . One of the biggest deterrents for drugmakers is that any new, more powerful antibiotics would need to be used sparingly because overuse could give rise to even more resistant bacteria, he said. . “When you develop, produce and market an antibiotic that is not supposed to be used in the first place unless all other existing therapies have failed, you need a special regulatory environment,” said Pfundner, who is also head of Swiss drugmaker Roche’s German unit, speaking at a media gathering. . “There is a legitimate concern among our members that there is not a sufficient market in the end for a product against multi-resistant germs.”  . The World Health Organization has warned that unless something drastic is done, many antibiotics could become redundant this century, leaving patients vulnerable to deadly infections, particularly during operations. . A review backed by the British government concluded this month that a global fund should be created to speed development of new antibiotics. . In the United States, drug industry and public health experts warned lawmakers in September that financial incentives and a more flexible regulatory approach were needed to persuade drug companies to develop new antibiotics. . Negotiation about new antibiotics reimbursement prices in Germany might also be modeled on the orphan drugs status, Pfundner suggested. Orphan drugs are currently exempt from a separate benefit assessment procedure that newly approved drugs have to undergo in Germany. . But a European or even multi-national approach was eventually needed, he added. . Germany’s health ministry has said on its website that Berlin would seek to address drug-resistant superbugs as part of the country’s presidency of the G7 group of nations, leading up to the G7 summit in Bavaria in June.         |Wed Feb 18 16:10:00 +0000 2015||Germany in push to encourage antibiotics development |5.680799958742344e+17|http://reut.rs/1G2Eq1v
Kathryn Doyle|Reuters - Engaging in mindfulness awareness practices may be more helpful for older people who have trouble sleeping than just learning about how to make their bedrooms more conducive to sleep, according to a small new study. . “These simple yet challenging meditation practices provide the opportunity for people to expand their nonjudgmental awareness of sensory experiences arising in each moment,” said David Black, the study’s lead author from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. . “Our findings arise from a structured mindfulness course with a skilled mindfulness instructor,” he said. “As compared to attempting mindfulness practice for the first time on your own, you are likely to gain the most benefit from a standardized course with an experience teacher.” . Previous studies found sleep benefits from movement-based meditation programs, such as tai chi, but none have looked at the possible benefits of non-movement meditation, the researchers write in JAMA Internal Medicine February 16. . A recent meta-analysis found that only mindfulness meditation, compared to other types of meditation, provided consistent benefits for stress-related conditions, Black told Reuters Health by email. . For the study, researchers included 49 people who were at least 55 years old with at least moderately disturbed sleep. After a phone interview and an in-person visit, they were randomly divided into two groups. . One group visited the study center for six weekly two-hour sessions of a course in Mindfulness Awareness Practices for daily living. Those included meditation, eating, walking, movement and friendly or loving-kindness practices. . A certified teacher, who led the exercises, handed out other resources. The teacher also told participants to meditate for five minutes daily, gradually increasing to 20 minutes daily. . The other group attended six weeks of a sleep hygiene and education course, where they learned about sleep problems, stress biology and stress reduction, self-monitoring of sleep behavior, relaxation methods for improving sleep, and weekly behavioral sleep hygiene strategies. . When the researchers measured sleep quality before the six-week programs, the average sleep quality questionnaire score was 10. A score of five or more indicates moderately disturbed sleep. . When the 49 participants completed the questionnaires again after the study, those in the meditation group had improved by an average of 2.8 points, compared to 1.1 points in the sleep hygiene group.  . Daytime impairments, including symptoms of insomnia, fatigue and depression, improved more for people in the meditation group than those in the sleep hygiene group, too. Anxiety symptoms improved equally in both groups. . This study is commendable because sleep disturbances are very common among older adults, according to Adam Spira of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. . “It turns out that some of the most widely used treatments are actually potentially harmful,” said Spira, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.  . Psychoactive sedative medications like benzodiazepine have been linked to poor health outcomes for older people, including cognitive decline, falls and general “fogginess,” he said.  . “There’s a whole branch of effective interventions, cognitive behavioral interventions, that are very effective across age groups at treating insomnia,” but many physicians are not aware of providers in their area who may administer these services, Spira said. . Mindfulness meditation is not the same as cognitive behavioral therapy, but based on this study it does seem to improve sleep, he said, adding that it’s not clear how the method works. . Relaxing and decreasing physiological arousal may make it easier to fall asleep, or improving mood and reducing fatigue may help, enabling more exercise during the day which has been shown to improve sleep, he said. . Mindfulness meditation is particularly promising because it could be disseminated widely through the community, and would even be available to people with physical impairments for whom movement-based practices may not be an option, he said. . “This is definitely something worth investigating further,” Spira said. “I’m a little bit reluctant to make recommendations at this point, but if people have an interest in mindfulness meditation it’s probably fine to try.” .

Kathryn Doyle|Reuters - Fifty percent of women will experience hot flashes and night sweats characteristic of menopause for about seven years, according to a new study. . The duration of symptoms, which are estimated for the first time in the new study, varies depending on a woman’s race and when her symptoms started, write the researchers in JAMA Internal Medicine. . “We were a little surprised at the extent, but it’s important to recognize that there is huge variation,” said lead author Dr. Nancy Avis of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  . “Some never have them, and some have them many times throughout the day,” Avis told Reuters Health by phone.  . One in five women in the new study did not report experiencing any of the so-called vasomotor symptoms, like hot flashes or night sweats, during menopause. . For the new study, the researcher used data on almost 1,500 women who transitioned to menopause between 1996 and 2013 and reported experiencing hot flashes or night sweats frequently, in this case meaning at least six days out of every 14. . The women reported to in-person visits at seven U.S. sites first in 1996, when they were between age 42 and 52, and then annually for the next 13 years. . Half of African American women in the study reported experiencing these symptoms frequently for at least 10 years, compared to almost nine years for Hispanic women, 6.5 years for non-Hispanic white women, and about five years for women of Japanese descent, the researchers write.  . Those who started experiencing symptoms at a younger age or before they had stopped menstruating, were less educated, reported more stress or higher levels of depression or anxiety at their first evaluation tended to experience frequent hot flashes and night sweats for more years than other women. . Though seven years is a long time to experience these symptoms, which can seriously impact quality of life, they may not be as severe or frequent for the whole seven-year period, Avis said. . “Conventional wisdom or dogma has been that these symptoms last only a few years and have minimal impact on quality of life,” but new research is overturning that, according to Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School.  . “For many there is interruption of sleep, fatigue, reduced ability to do daily activities and impaired quality of life,” she told Reuters Health by phone.  . Importantly, even if a woman starts to have hot flashes while she is still menstruating, she should continue to use contraception because she is still capable of conceiving, said Mason, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the findings. . Some very simple steps can help ease these symptoms, like wearing layers and keeping the bedroom cool at night, or avoiding coffee, alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods, all of which can trigger hot flashes, Avis said.  . Hormone therapy, which doctors can prescribe, does ease menopausal symptoms, but over time will increase the risk of breast cancer so is usually discontinued after a few years, which would not cover a seven-year duration of symptoms, Avis said.  . “We also know that for many, when they go off of hormone therapy they can have a rebound effect and symptoms get worse,” she said. “That may be a time for trying mindfulness, acupuncture, yoga: that helps some women, but not all.” . Some women may try herbs and botanicals, but these are not regulated by U.S. health officials and may interact with medications, so women should have a consultation with their doctors first, Avis said.  . Two or three different treatments may be needed throughout the duration of the symptoms, and women should not hesitate to talk to their doctors about it, Manson said.  . “These distressing and bothersome symptoms may last 10 to 11 years,” she said. “Don’t shy away from discussing treatment options.” .

Lisa Rapaport|Reuters - A nicotine addiction pill can help smokers quit gradually when they can’t go cold turkey, a study finds, suggesting that it may be time to revisit practice guidelines that focus primarily on immediate cessation. . Smokers who took the pill, sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere, were much more likely to quit after cutting back on cigarettes than smokers who didn’t use the drug, the study found. . “This allows us to reach a much broader population of smokers who aren’t willing to quit abruptly or set a quit date, and it shows that people can quit without going cold turkey,” said lead study author Dr. Jon Ebbert, a professor in primary care and internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “This is very strong support for changing clinical practice to include gradual reduction aided by medication.” . Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And tobacco kills one in 10 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. . Quitting can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus and bladder. Ten years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC. . To see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks.  . They asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12. . By the last ten weeks of treatment, weeks 15 to 24, the group taking the pill had significantly higher abstinence rates than the group on placebo. . This held true even after treatment stopped. For weeks 21 through 52 of the study, 27 percent of the people who had previously taken the drug successfully avoided smoking, compared with less than 10 percent of those who received the placebo. . “This is the first study of its kind to enroll a group of smokers who are not traditionally enrolled in clinical trials because they are not ready to quit,” said Dr. Caryn Lerman, professor of psychiatry and deputy director of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. . “It offers compelling evidence that gradual reduction should be considered to facilitate quitting,” she said. . But even though the approach helped some hard-to-reach smokers, the majority of them still failed to quit, noted Lerman, who wasn’t involved in the study. Other treatments, such as nicotine patches and gum, can also help some smokers cut back gradually, she said. . While the study shows that Chantix, which is known generically as varenicline, can be effective for some smokers, the group taking the pill also experienced more side effects such as nausea, abnormal dreams, insomnia, constipation, vomiting, and weight gain. . Previous research has linked Chantix to side effects including suicidal thoughts, erratic behavior and drowsiness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a black box warning - its most severe and restrictive warning - on the product in 2009, highlighting the drug’s adverse neuropsychological effects. . People with a history of major depressive or anxiety disorder, suicidal behavior, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis were excluded from the study, published in the American Medical Association’s journal JAMA. .

|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some 11.4 million Americans enrolled in private health insurance through Obamacare during the open enrollment period, the White House said in a tweet on Tuesday. . “The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is working. It’s working better than we anticipated, certainly working a lot better than many of the critics talked about early on,” President Barack Obama said in a video linked to the White House tweet. . Administration officials have said they expected 9.1 million people to be enrolled in coverage and up to date on insurance payments by the end of the year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had predicted 12 million enrollees for 2015. . Last April, the Obama administration announced that more than 8 million people had selected plans for 2014. But by the end of last year, only 6.7 million were still enrolled. . Obamacare’s open enrollment period for 2015 began on Nov. 15 and closed on Sunday. . The White House said there had been a surge of applications in the last nine days of enrollment, particularly on Sunday. . “Sunday, February 15 was the biggest enrollment day ever: more new consumers signed up for health coverage than on any day this open enrollment period or the last,” the White House said in a statement. . The U.S. Health and Human Services Department said on Saturday that a technical problem had prevented some consumers from enrolling but that the issue, involving income verification, was fixed late on Saturday.  . The department said on Saturday that anyone who had been unable to submit an application because income could not be verified due to that problem or any other technical issue would receive an extension for enrollment. . Plans for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, are sold on HealthCare.gov for 37 states. The other 13 states plus Washington, D.C., run their own websites. . The Obama administration said last week that 2015 Obamacare subsidies were averaging $268 a month for people in the 37 states who had qualified for federal assistance.  |Wed Feb 18 00:44:36 +0000 2015||Some 11.4 million Americans have enrolled in Obamacare: White House |5.6784711275659674e+17|http://reut.rs/1E3W4mp
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California public health officials, grappling with a measles outbreak that has already sickened 113 people statewide, urged residents on Tuesday to vaccinate themselves and their children before traveling internationally over spring school break. . More than 150 people have been diagnosed with measles across the United States, many of them linked to an outbreak that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons. . The California Department of Public Health said that with spring school holidays approaching many Californians were planning trips abroad and that inoculations were especially important. . “Measles is extremely contagious and can be very serious. The best way to protect yourself and your family against measles is with the Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination, which is 97 percent effective after two doses,” Dr. Gil Chavez, the state’s chief epidemiologist, said in a written statement. . “Vaccination is especially important for those who plan to travel internationally, which places them at high risk of getting the disease and spreading it to others after they come home,” Chavez said.   . California health officials also urged residents returning from travel overseas to watch for symptoms of measles, including fever, cough, and a rash that typically appears first on the face and spreads downward. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. . Of California’s 113 confirmed cases of measles, 39 are believed to have resulted from visits to Disneyland in late December. An additional 34 had contacts with those people in a household or community setting. . Last week, health officials warned commuters on San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit system that they may have been exposed to measles after an infectious LinkedIn worker rode the train to and from work for three days. |Wed Feb 18 00:28:46 +0000 2015||California health officials urge measles vaccine before spring travel |5.678431285788713e+17|http://reut.rs/1E3TwVA

Bill Coterell|TALLAHASSEE (Reuters) - Florida’s highest court put executions on hold Tuesday while the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether use of a controversial general anesthetic constitutes “cruel and unusual” punishment of condemned killers. . The state Supreme Court stopped the execution of Jerry William Correll next week because the Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a challenge some Oklahoma inmates brought against use of midazolam hydrochloride as the first of three drugs used in lethal injections. Florida uses essentially the same formula, the court said in a 5-2 ruling. . The state switched to midazolam as an anesthetic in 2013 when some foreign drug manufacturers quit supplying other drugs previously used in executions. The Department of Corrections said 11 lethal injections have been carried out with midazolam in Florida since then. .     Florida courts have approved midazolam, but the nation’s highest court agreed Jan. 23 to hear an appeal by 21 Oklahoma inmates in a case citing prolonged executions and signs of pain reported in that state, Arizona and Ohio. .     Chief Justice Jorge Labarga wrote that if the nation’s highest court rules in favor of the prisoners, “then Florida’s precedent approving the use of midazolam and the current Florida three-drug protocol will be subject to serious doubt as to its continued viability.” .     Justices Charles Canady and Ricky Polston dissented, saying Florida should proceed with Correll’s execution unless the U.S. Supreme Court stays it. Canady wrote that a stay in another state does not automatically require one in Florida, and that agreeing to review Oklahoma’s use of the drug means the justices will forbid it. .     Canady said Oklahoma agreed to postpone three pending executions, while Florida has not agreed to suspend lethal injections. Correll, scheduled to die Feb. 26, was the only Florida inmate with an active death warrant. .     He also noted that lower federal courts have approved Oklahoma’s use of the drug and said it is “purely speculative” whether the Supreme Court will reverse them. .     Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, said the Supreme Court appeal is a toss-up. .     “They might affirm it,” Dieter said. “But it would be terrible to go ahead with an execution when the person’s life or death depends solely on his having a date between the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case and its decision in that case.” .     Correll was convicted of the 1985 murders of his ex-wife, five-year-old daughter and former mother-in-law and sister-in-law. |Wed Feb 18 00:04:03 +0000 2015||Florida puts executions on hold as high court debates anesthetic |5.678369068153856e+17|http://reut.rs/1E3OCI3
Brendan Pierson|(Reuters) - Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp on Tuesday said it has agreed to pay $600 million to Johnson & Johnson to settle a long-running lawsuit over Boston Scientific’s 2005 acquisition of rival Guidant. . J&J had sought more than $7 billion in damages after it lost a bidding war to Boston Scientific following an initial deal to buy Guidant for $21.5 billion in 2005. J&J accused Guidant of breaking that deal. . Boston Scientific, which admitted no liability by Guidant under the settlement, said it expects to record a pre-tax litigation-related charge of about $600 million in its fourth quarter 2014 results. J&J will permanently drop its lawsuit. . J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in a statement that the settlement “reflects how important it is for parties involved in merger agreements to fully live up to their obligations.” . Boston Scientific general counsel Tim Pratt said in a statement that the settlement was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. . The settlement came just a month after attorneys for the two companies wrapped up a non-jury trial in Manhattan federal court. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, did not rule. . Under the 2005 merger deal at the heart of the dispute, Guidant was allowed to consider competing bids alongside J&J’s, but not solicit them. . In late 2005, Boston Scientific announced that it planned to make an offer, which was contingent on selling some of Guidant’s assets to Abbott Laboratories to deal with antitrust concerns. J&J claimed in its lawsuit that Guidant violated the merger agreement by providing due diligence directly to Abbott, making Boston Scientific’s offer possible. . Boston Scientific eventually acquired Guidant for $27 billion and paid J&J a $705 million termination fee. . The deal, which left Boston Scientific laden with debt and dealing with a host of Guidant product recalls, was widely considered to be a disaster for Boston Scientific. At trial, Boston Scientific argued that J&J should not get any damages because it was better off for losing the bidding war. . The case is Johnson & Johnson v. Guidant Corporation, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 06-7685. |Tue Feb 17 23:21:15 +0000 2015||Boston Scientific to pay J&amp;J $600 million to settle Guidant suit |5.678261380531528e+17|http://reut.rs/1E3GCqu
Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - Engaging in mindfulness awareness practices may be more helpful for older people who have trouble sleeping than just learning about how to make their bedrooms more conducive to sleep, according to a small new study. . “These simple yet challenging meditation practices provide the opportunity for people to expand their nonjudgmental awareness of sensory experiences arising in each moment,” said David Black, the study’s lead author from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. . “Our findings arise from a structured mindfulness course with a skilled mindfulness instructor,” he said. “As compared to attempting mindfulness practice for the first time on your own, you are likely to gain the most benefit from a standardized course with an experience teacher.” . Previous studies found sleep benefits from movement-based meditation programs, such as tai chi, but none have looked at the possible benefits of non-movement meditation, the researchers write in JAMA Internal Medicine February 16. . A recent meta-analysis found that only mindfulness meditation, compared to other types of meditation, provided consistent benefits for stress-related conditions, Black told Reuters Health by email. . For the study, researchers included 49 people who were at least 55 years old with at least moderately disturbed sleep. After a phone interview and an in-person visit, they were randomly divided into two groups. . One group visited the study center for six weekly two-hour sessions of a course in Mindfulness Awareness Practices for daily living. Those included meditation, eating, walking, movement and friendly or loving-kindness practices. . A certified teacher, who led the exercises, handed out other resources. The teacher also told participants to meditate for five minutes daily, gradually increasing to 20 minutes daily. . The other group attended six weeks of a sleep hygiene and education course, where they learned about sleep problems, stress biology and stress reduction, self-monitoring of sleep behavior, relaxation methods for improving sleep, and weekly behavioral sleep hygiene strategies. . When the researchers measured sleep quality before the six-week programs, the average sleep quality questionnaire score was 10. A score of five or more indicates moderately disturbed sleep. . When the 49 participants completed the questionnaires again after the study, those in the meditation group had improved by an average of 2.8 points, compared to 1.1 points in the sleep hygiene group.  . Daytime impairments, including symptoms of insomnia, fatigue and depression, improved more for people in the meditation group than those in the sleep hygiene group, too. Anxiety symptoms improved equally in both groups. . This study is commendable because sleep disturbances are very common among older adults, according to Adam Spira of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. . “It turns out that some of the most widely used treatments are actually potentially harmful,” said Spira, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.  . Psychoactive sedative medications like benzodiazepine have been linked to poor health outcomes for older people, including cognitive decline, falls and general “fogginess,” he said.  . “There’s a whole branch of effective interventions, cognitive behavioral interventions, that are very effective across age groups at treating insomnia,” but many physicians are not aware of providers in their area who may administer these services, Spira said. . Mindfulness meditation is not the same as cognitive behavioral therapy, but based on this study it does seem to improve sleep, he said, adding that it’s not clear how the method works. . Relaxing and decreasing physiological arousal may make it easier to fall asleep, or improving mood and reducing fatigue may help, enabling more exercise during the day which has been shown to improve sleep, he said. . Mindfulness meditation is particularly promising because it could be disseminated widely through the community, and would even be available to people with physical impairments for whom movement-based practices may not be an option, he said. . “This is definitely something worth investigating further,” Spira said. “I’m a little bit reluctant to make recommendations at this point, but if people have an interest in mindfulness meditation it’s probably fine to try.” .

Kathryn Doyle|Electric fans can help keep core body temperatures and heart rates from going up in extreme heat and humidity, according to a small new study from Australia. . Public health organizations recommend against using fans in extreme heat, because it may warm people up rather than cool them down. The new study suggests fans keep people cool by helping sweat evaporate off their bodies, said Ollie Jay, the study’s senior author from the University of Sydney. . For the new study, eight healthy young men completed four high-temperature trials lasting two and a half hours each. The trials were separated by two days of break time. They wore shorts and t-shirts and sat in a chamber kept at either 97 or 108 degrees Fahrenheit. . The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against using fans in heat that exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit. . For one session, there was no fan in the room, and in a second session at the same temperature they had an 18-inch electric fan blowing on them from about three feet away. The researchers gradually increased the relative humidity. . They also monitored the participants’ heart rates and core temperatures. . “People often perish in heat waves not because they had a critically high body temperature but because the elevated heart rate that arose from the heat stress exposed some underlying cardiovascular problem, which results in some kind of cardiac event,” Jay told Reuters Health by email. . According to the results, core body temperatures and heart rates reached a critical point at a higher relative humidity when the fan was running at both 97 and 108 degrees.  . At 97 degrees, the metrics sharply increased at an average of 83% humidity with a fan compared to 62% humidity without a fan. At 108 degrees, the same thing happened at 47% humidity with a fan and 38% without a fan. . “Elevated body temperature is associated with heat stress, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (which can be fatal),” said Dr. Jonathan Patz, who is director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. . Deaths and hospitalizations during heat waves are a serious problem, Jay noted, citing a 2009 heat wave in Australia. Fans could actually have large protective benefits, based on the new results. . In fact, he said the participants experienced less stress at the higher temperature with a  fan than at the lower temperature without a fan. . “With respect to other measures, ideally one should seek air conditioning if possible,” Jay said. “However, some people, particularly those found to be at elevated risk during heat waves, do not necessarily have access to air conditioning.” . “Other options include putting some cold water in a bath tub and immersing yourself in it to cool you down,” Jay said.  . Hydration is one of the most important preventive measures during heat waves, said Patz, who was not involved in the new study. . On the citywide level, enhanced tree canopies and more reflective, less heat-absorbing surfaces, could reduce heat-related mortality by more than 40% in Atlanta, Philadelphia or Phoenix, he said. . The researchers write in their research letter online February 17 in JAMA that the results don’t apply to anyone other than young healthy men. . Additionally, Jay said sweat may evaporate without a fan under hot and dry conditions. Adding a fan would probably increase a person’s temperature. . SOURCE: .   .

Results of the randomized clinical trial were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Sanofi said.  . “We are very encouraged by these results as they ultimately point to a safe and effective oral treatment option for patients living with Gaucher disease,” lead author Pramod Mistry, Professor of Pediatrics & Internal Medicine at Yale University School of Medicine, said in a statement.  |Tue Feb 17 17:07:42 +0000 2015||Sanofi says Cerdelga trial shows promise |5.6773213242526515e+17|http://reut.rs/1FXHPyB
|(Reuters) - British drugmaker Celsus Therapeutics Plc’s U.S.-listed shares plunged as much as 83 percent after the company’s skin cream failed the main goal of a mid-stage study. . Celsus Chief Executive Gur Roshwalb said he was “surprised” by the number of patients who responded to a placebo. . The cream, MRX-6, is being developed to treat atopic dermatitis, or eczema, a chronic skin rash or inflammation that often appears in infancy or childhood. The cause of the disease is unknown. . The National Institutes of Health estimates that eczema affects between 9 and 30 percent of the U.S. population. . Current treatments for the condition include corticosteroid creams and ointments, with antibiotics being prescribed if the rash follows an infection. . Celsus said earlier that MRX-6 would be a safer and more effective alternative to corticosteroids, which are often associated with behavioral changes, weight gain, high blood sugar and diabetes. . Earlier tests of the cream, MRX-6, found it to be safe and effective for use in adults. The trial results announced on Tuesday showed that the drug failed to replicate that success in children. . Celsus said it would analyze the data from the trial and determine the next steps for the drug, its lead compound. . The company’s pipeline includes a compound to treat eye problems. It also has two drugs in the animal-testing stage. . Celsus’ stock was down 80 percent at $1.20 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. |Tue Feb 17 16:15:49 +0000 2015||Celsus Therapeutics skin cream fails study |5.677190727593001e+17|http://reut.rs/1FXrv11
Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - Fifty percent of women will experience hot flashes and night sweats characteristic of menopause for about seven years, according to a new study. . The duration of symptoms, which are estimated for the first time in the new study, varies depending on a woman’s race and when her symptoms started, write the researchers in JAMA Internal Medicine. . “We were a little surprised at the extent, but it’s important to recognize that there is huge variation,” said lead author Dr. Nancy Avis of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  . “Some never have them, and some have them many times throughout the day,” Avis told Reuters Health by phone.  . One in five women in the new study did not report experiencing any of the so-called vasomotor symptoms, like hot flashes or night sweats, during menopause. . For the new study, the researcher used data on almost 1,500 women who transitioned to menopause between 1996 and 2013 and reported experiencing hot flashes or night sweats frequently, in this case meaning at least six days out of every 14. . The women reported to in-person visits at seven U.S. sites first in 1996, when they were between age 42 and 52, and then annually for the next 13 years. . Half of African American women in the study reported experiencing these symptoms frequently for at least 10 years, compared to almost nine years for Hispanic women, 6.5 years for non-Hispanic white women, and about five years for women of Japanese descent, the researchers write.  . Those who started experiencing symptoms at a younger age or before they had stopped menstruating, were less educated, reported more stress or higher levels of depression or anxiety at their first evaluation tended to experience frequent hot flashes and night sweats for more years than other women. . Though seven years is a long time to experience these symptoms, which can seriously impact quality of life, they may not be as severe or frequent for the whole seven-year period, Avis said. . “Conventional wisdom or dogma has been that these symptoms last only a few years and have minimal impact on quality of life,” but new research is overturning that, according to Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School.  . “For many there is interruption of sleep, fatigue, reduced ability to do daily activities and impaired quality of life,” she told Reuters Health by phone.  . Importantly, even if a woman starts to have hot flashes while she is still menstruating, she should continue to use contraception because she is still capable of conceiving, said Mason, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the findings. . Some very simple steps can help ease these symptoms, like wearing layers and keeping the bedroom cool at night, or avoiding coffee, alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods, all of which can trigger hot flashes, Avis said.  . Hormone therapy, which doctors can prescribe, does ease menopausal symptoms, but over time will increase the risk of breast cancer so is usually discontinued after a few years, which would not cover a seven-year duration of symptoms, Avis said.  . “We also know that for many, when they go off of hormone therapy they can have a rebound effect and symptoms get worse,” she said. “That may be a time for trying mindfulness, acupuncture, yoga: that helps some women, but not all.” . Some women may try herbs and botanicals, but these are not regulated by U.S. health officials and may interact with medications, so women should have a consultation with their doctors first, Avis said.  . Two or three different treatments may be needed throughout the duration of the symptoms, and women should not hesitate to talk to their doctors about it, Manson said.  . “These distressing and bothersome symptoms may last 10 to 11 years,” she said. “Don’t shy away from discussing treatment options.” .

|(Reuters) - Pharmacyclics Inc said its cancer drug developed with a Johnson & Johnson unit improved overall response rate in high-risk leukemia patients. . Those administered with Imbruvica showed an overall response rate of 88 percent, while 76.6 percent survived without the disease getting worse at 24 months. . All 16 patients enrolled in the small study suffered from high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and had failed to benefit from stem cell transplants and other therapies. . Patients who relapse of CLL following stem cell transplant are hard to treat with chemotherapy as they do not produce enough blood cells or develop post-transplant complications. . This could be a new patient population for the drug, which is already approved for a number of other indications associated with CLL. . Imbruvica is already approved for CLL patients who have received at least one prior therapy, and for CLL patients with a rare genetic mutation. . About 115,000 patients suffer from CLL in the United States and about 16,000 are newly diagnosed each year. . Shares of Pharmacyclics were up 1.4 percent at $165.69 in early trading on the Nasdaq. |Tue Feb 17 15:53:21 +0000 2015||J&amp;J-Pharmacyclics drug shows potential in high-risk leukemia patients |5.677134213582971e+17|http://reut.rs/1FXmwx3
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.” . Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history. . “The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement. . CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans. . The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment. . Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime. . Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market. . Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion. . Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake.  . “We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,” Miller said. . Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors.  . They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used by those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor.  . Amgen declined to comment on the pricing issue and Regeneron did not respond to a request for comment. . Shares of Amgen closed up 0.5 percent at $154.24, while Regeneron’s stock gained 0.4 percent to $404.18. Sanofi’s shares slipped 0.2 percent to 85.53 euros in trading in Paris. |Tue Feb 17 15:37:27 +0000 2015||CVS says new cholesterol drugs could cost U.S. $150 billion/year |5.677094163264389e+17|http://reut.rs/1E1XsG7
|(Reuters) - Israel’s VBL Therapeutics said it would stop developing its experimental inflammatory drug to fight psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, leading to half its market value being wiped off. . The company said the drug, VB-201, failed to meet the main goal in separate mid-stage trials testing it in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. . VB-201 aims to treat chronic immune-inflammatory diseases by mimicking the body’s natural anti-inflammatory response. . VBL Therapeutics, the operative name of Vascular Biogenics Ltd, was forced to settle for a $40 million IPO last year after its prior effort to go public was thwarted as a major investor failed to complete a stock purchase. . The Tel-Aviv-based company separately said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted a partial hold on another drug that it is testing to treat an aggressive form of brain cancer. . The biotech drug, VB-111, will be evaluated in a late-stage study in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The hold was imposed by the agency in July, pending additional data. . VB-111 is also being tested to fight ovarian cancer and the most common form of thyroid cancer. . VBL Therapeutics shares were down 55.5 percent at $6.28 on the Nasdaq in early trading on Tuesday. The stock had more than doubled in value this year through Friday. |Tue Feb 17 14:38:55 +0000 2015||VBL to stop developing drug for psoriasis, ulcerative colitis |5.676946865599324e+17|http://reut.rs/1E1LoVs
James Harding Giahyue|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Thousands of Liberian children in pristine uniforms flocked back to school on Monday as classrooms opened their doors for the first time after a six-month hiatus designed to stem the spread of the worst Ebola outbreak in history. . Dozens of schools reopened, in a sign the outbreak is ebbing in Liberia, once its epicenter. The epidemic has killed more than 9,000 people there and in Sierra Leone and Guinea. . The closures were yet another setback for a country whose health system and economy, based on diamonds, coffee and cocoa, were devastated by the virus. . At the peak last summer, Ebola patients were collapsing outside overflowing hospitals but now there are only a handful of new cases a week. . In the sunny courtyard of a Catholic school in the Congo Town district of the capital Monrovia, hundreds of students gathered to hear the principal’s welcome. Medics took children’s temperatures and told them not to stand too close together. . “I feel very great being in school in the first day, most especially after a long period of time waiting for this day,” said teenager Faith Sayeh.  . But in the classrooms there were some empty desks as parents kept their children at home while other schools remained closed. . “Only one of my seven children I have registered,” said Lindsay Seakor, who lost her job last August due to the epidemic and says she cannot afford to pay for books and uniforms. . Some schools opened on Monday but had to send students home by mid-morning because teachers failed to turn up. George Wuo, a regional director of the ministry of education, said all schools in the country would have to open by March 2 or face fines. . Neighboring Guinea reopened most of its schools in January, but some parents have withdrawn children amid rumors schools were infected with the virus.  . Sierra Leone hopes to open schools by the end of next month. Around 30 have been converted into treatment centers and will have to be emptied and decontaminated first. . In Liberia, some of about a million enrolled students have been following lessons by radio. . “Authorities in the three countries are looking at catch-up sessions and cancelling some school vacations. It will be challenging,” said Sayo Aoki, education specialist in Ebola Emergencies at the U.N.

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Studies on the health impact of “plain” or standardized cigarette packs suggest they can deter non-smokers from taking up the habit and may cut the number of cigarettes smokers get through, scientists said on Tuesday. . In a collection of scientific papers in the journal Addiction, researchers said that while standardized packs were still too new to provide substantial evidence, studies so far showed they were likely to reduce smoking rates. . Britain plans before May to become the second country in the world to introduce non-branded, standardized packaging for cigarettes, after the government promised last month to pass legislation that would come into effect in 2016. . Australia introduced standardized packaging two years ago in the face of fierce opposition from the tobacco industry. Its law forced cigarettes to be sold in plain green packs with health warnings and images showing the damaging effects of smoking.  . In the Addiction series of studies, researchers found that after Australia’s move in 2012, when plain packages were introduced and the health warnings and images on them were made larger, smoking in outdoor areas of cafes, bars and restaurants declined and fewer smokers left their packs visible on tables. . Another study found that removing brand imagery from packs increased the focus on health warnings among occasional smokers and adolescents just starting to smoke. . Robert West, editor-in-chief of the journal, said plain packaging’s effect on young potential smokers was likely to be the most important initial impact. . “Even if standardized packaging had no effect at all on current smokers and only stopped one in 20 young people from being lured into smoking (in the UK), it would save about 2,000 lives a year,” he told reporters at a briefing in London. . Tobacco firms have fought hard against the new law, saying standard packs infringe on intellectual property rights covering branding and will only increase counterfeiting and smuggling. . But Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, said cigarette makers should note that if their product had been invented today, it would never have even reached the consumer market. . “For an addictive product that kills so many of its users, the tobacco industry should consider itself fortunate that ... it is allowed to sell its toxic products at all, let alone try to make them attractive through the packaging,” she said.  |Tue Feb 17 00:25:56 +0000 2015||Plain tobacco packs likely to deter smoking, studies show |5.674800271017902e+17|http://reut.rs/1DZT0I7
Ronnie Cohen|NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Meditation over many years is tied to smaller age-related decreases in brain volume, according to a new study.  . People who reported meditating for an average of 20 years had higher brain volumes than the average person, researchers report in Frontiers in Psychology. . While it’s known that the volume of a brain’s gray matter decreases as a person ages, the study’s senior author told Reuters Health that the team of researchers expected to see more gray matter in certain regions of the brain among long-term meditators. . “But we see that this effect is really widespread throughout the brain,” said Dr. Florian Kurth, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles Brain Mapping Center. . Kurth and his colleagues write that they can’t say meditation caused its practitioners to lose less brain volume, however. Other habits of long-term meditators may also influence brain volume. . Nearly 18 million adults and 1 million children practiced meditation in the U.S. in 2012, according to a survey on complementary medicine from the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Though meditative techniques have roots in Eastern religious and spiritual traditions, Americans today often meditate outside of religious settings, according to the survey. . Prior studies found that meditation can improve attention, memory, verbal fluency, executive function and creativity, Kurth and his colleagues write. . For the new study, the researchers compared the brain scans of 50 long-term meditators to those of 50 men and women from the general population. The participants ranged in age from 24 to 77 years. The meditators reported being involved in the practice for four to 46 years. . Overall, the volume of gray matter shown on the brain scans decreased as the age of the participants increased. But the meditators’ brains appeared better preserved than average people of the same age. . Moreover, the researchers were surprised to find less age-related gray matter loss throughout the brains of meditators. . Los Angeles singer-songwriter Julianna Raye, who began meditating 20 years ago, was amazed at what she saw when she looked at her brain scan compared to a scan of another 48-year-old woman from the general population. . “The difference was definitely discernible,” she said. “It made me think of flossing your teeth so you don’t get gingivitis. You exercise your brain, and you can see the results.” . The study prompted Kurth to want to return to his own abandoned meditation practice. . “This study says it’s basically worthwhile to think about meditation,” he said. . Dr. Madhav Goyal told Reuters Health that the new study failed to convince him that he could prescribe meditation as an elixir to prevent brain loss. . “There’s still a lot of research that needs to be done,” said Goyal, who practices meditation and studies it as a professor at The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. . The UCLA researchers found insignificant results when they performed the most conservative statistical analysis on their findings, he said. . Goyal would have liked the study to compare skill levels between meditators and non-meditators. He also questioned what kind of meditation, and whether it was indeed meditation, the meditators were doing. . “Meditation programs differ in how rigorously they teach the activity, a few hours over a few weeks versus 100 hours in a weeklong training,” Goyal said. . The new study “adds a little bit more evidence to the idea that the brain has plasticity, and by practicing certain mental activities, such as meditation, we can see structural changes in the brain as a result,” he said. .

Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - People who only focused on eating 30 grams of fiber per day lost almost as much weight as those who followed a more complicated diet, according to a new year-long study. . A “permissive” dietary plan, like focusing on increasing fiber, may produce more beneficial effects than a “restrictive” plan, like reducing saturated fat, said lead author Dr. Yunsheng Ma of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.  . “We chose dietary fiber because it exerts clinical benefits on several components of metabolic syndrome, including waist circumference, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and insulin control, in addition to body weight and regulation of certain inflammatory markers,” Ma wrote in an email to Reuters Health. . For the new study, Ma and his coauthors divided 240 obese adults with metabolic syndrome into two groups. One group followed the American Heart Association (AHA) diet plan and the other aimed to eat at least 30 grams of fiber per day. . About 25% of adults worldwide have metabolic syndrome, which includes symptoms like a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  . The American Heart Association Eating Plan recommends that adults consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily from foods, such as vegetables, legumes or whole grains, although the average American only eats about 15 grams per day. . The AHA diet calls for increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grain or high fiber foods and lean proteins, minimizing sugar, sodium, alcohol, saturated fats, trans fats and cholesterol, and eating fish twice weekly. People on the AHA diet were given individualized calorie and saturated fat goals.  . After one year, people in both groups had lost weight and improved their blood pressure, dietary quality, and insulin resistance, according to the results online February 16 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  . But the high-fiber group had lost an average of about four and a half pounds, compared to nearly six pounds in the AHA diet group. Also, seven people in the fiber group developed diabetes over the year-long study, compared to only one in the AHA group.  . The high fiber diet still showed positive results and was easy to follow, which often leads to more successful diet compliance, according to Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic who works closely with the department of preventive cardiology. . High fiber intake is one of the most important aspects of the AHA diet, she wrote in an email to Reuters Health. . “Fiber fills you up, expands in your stomach, fiber also keeps you fuller longer,” said Zumpano, was not part of the new study. But it may need to be limited for people with any kind of bowel issues or a history of diarrhea, she noted, and the other aspects of the AHA diet do have benefits as well. . Americans in general have a lot of room for improvement with fiber intake, Ma said. Legumes, barley and other whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables are all fiber sources.  . “However, we ask not to rely on fiber supplements or any one food to increase daily fiber, but rather to obtain fiber from a variety of foods in their diet as suited to individual tastes and preferences,” he said.  .

Shereen Lehman|Reuters Health - Therapeutic tape reduces chronic muscle pain better than no treatment at all but isn’t better than other methods, according to a new analysis. . The tape, which often goes by the name Kinesio, can sometimes be seen on the skin of high-profile athletes, and is purported to reduce pain and promote healing by improving circulation to the tissues underneath, write the researchers in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. . After reviewing published studies, the researchers found the tape may help in the reduction of pain, at least in the short term, compared to sham therapy or when it’s used in addition to standard treatment, wrote Edwin Choon Wyn Lim, the study’s co-author, in an email to Reuters Health. . “But there is insufficient evidence to suggest that Kinesio taping is better at reducing pain when compared to other treatment approaches,” said Lim, a physiotherapist at Singapore General Hospital.  . The authors combined the data from 17 previous clinical trials that examined the use of Kinesio tape for chronic pain lasting more than four weeks. The analysis included 416 patients who received the tape treatments and 406 patients who did not. . The study team found that using the tape improved pain relief, compared to no taping, sham taping and other minimal care techniques. There was no improvement in disability, however. . Additionally, the researchers found that taping did not reduce pain or disability, compared to any standard treatments, such as physical therapy and exercise. . The researchers caution that there are limitations to their study, such as the use of different taping techniques and the number of treatments. . The review also couldn’t determine whether certain conditions respond better to the tape than others. For example, Lim said it could be that taping may work better for pain conditions with swelling. . Lim added that anyone with musculoskeletal injuries should seek medical attention first, “then, if taping is indicated, always insist on a certified taping practitioner to do the job.” . More research is needed to clarify the mechanism behind any possible effect, he said. . “The authors had the intention to show the real results and conclusions discussing it, and show that there are some effects in some trials in pain, small but they are there,” said Thiago Vilela Lemos, a physical therapist at the State University of Goias in Brazil. . Future researchers should consider that the tape is usually used with another therapy, Lemos wrote in an email to Reuters Health. He was not involved with the new study. . Kenzo Kase, who developed the Kinesio Taping Method in the 1970s, told Reuters Health in an email that the tape works by producing a negative pressure on the skin’s surface, creating space for blood and lymphatic flow.  . “It is useful for addressing swelling and bruising in the early stages of recovery from injury or surgery, and for stability and muscle support during rehabilitation and to increase the speed of recovery,” said Kase, who is a chiropractor from Japan. He was not involved in the study.  . Kase said the tape can be used alone but sometimes it is appropriate to use it with other therapies.  . SOURCE: .   .

Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - Social and economic status does not explain the racial gaps in the care and outcomes of kids with type 1 diabetes, according to a new study. . The finding suggests researchers look to other factors that may explain the racial gap in type 1 diabetes care, such as the perceptions of doctors and families, write the researchers in the journal Pediatrics February 16. . Previous studies done in much smaller populations have had somewhat similar findings, wrote lead author Dr. Steven Willi of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in an email to Reuters Health. . More than 29 million Americans have diabetes, 5% of who have type 1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.     . Willi and his coauthors used data from more than 10,000 kids under age 18 in a type 1 diabetes registry, following them for at least a year. The majority of the kids were white, but 11% were Hispanic and 7% were black. . The researchers say children who were black tended to have worse control over their diabetes, compared to white and Hispanic children. . Mean hemoglobin A1c should be below 7.5% among children younger than 19 years with type 1 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. . That measure was 9.6% among black children. That compared to 8.4% among white kids and 8.7% among Hispanic kids. . Black children also had more complications from type 1 diabetes, compared to white and Hispanic children, the researchers found. . The racial gap in diabetes management remained even after the researchers adjusted for factors that may influence diabetes management, including the social and economic status of the children’s families. . The researchers also found that black children were less likely to have insulin pumps, compared to white and Hispanic children after adjusting for their families’ social and economic status.     . Willi said other possible explanations for the racial disparity in diabetes care and outcomes include cultural differences in acceptance of insulin pumps, the interaction between black diabetes patients and their primarily white healthcare providers, or in fact that providers have a racial bias in the diabetes care relationship.  . “I do not feel that diabetes care providers are overtly racist in any way,” Willi stressed. “However, I do have lingering concerns that subliminal racial bias still exists in this country, and the medical community is not immune to this.” . There may be another explanation, according to Dr. Stuart Chalew of Children’s Hospital of New Orleans, who wrote an editorial accompanying the results. . “What is hemoglobin A1c?” Chalew said. “Doctors will say it’s the mean blood glucose,” but that’s a simplified way to look at it, he said. In previous studies, even when black and white patients have the same blood sugar levels, they can have higher A1c, which may be due to genetic differences, he said.  . That issue wasn’t really assessed in the new paper, although the results are still valuable since the sample of kids was so large, he told Reuters Health by phone.  . A1c measurements may be overestimating blood sugar for black patients, leading them to take more insulin and inadvertently push their blood sugar too low, which would explain the higher rate of complications, he said. . Closing the racial gap among people with type 1 diabetes will hinge on uncovering the root cause. . “Of course, healthcare providers should continue to strive for cultural sensitivity in their practice,” Willi said. “Finally, if this gap is due, in part, to subliminal racial bias, it will be helpful to recognize that this bias exists, and actively work toward its eradication.” .

|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three states hardest hit by an epidemic of Ebola, said on Monday they had set a target of reducing the number of new cases to zero within 60 days. . The worst Ebola epidemic in history broke out in late 2013 in Guinea and has killed more than 9,000 people in all. Its spread is slowing but the World Heath Organization (WHO) warned of complacency after a recent spike in cases. . “The heads of state and the governments of the Mano River Union recognize the effort deployed by the states and the international community which has led to a decline in Ebola. They want to achieve zero new Ebola cases in 60 days from 15th Feb. 2015,” Guinea’s presidency said in a statement. . However, the number of new Ebola cases increased for the second consecutive week, with 144 new confirmed cases reported in the week to Feb. 8, the WHO said on its website. . Guinea reported 65 new confirmed cases, compared with 39 the week before. Sierra Leone had 76 new confirmed cases while Liberia continues to report a low number of new confirmed cases. . Guinean President Alpha Conde has announced a national plan to have no Ebola cases by early March. |Mon Feb 16 11:15:46 +0000 2015||Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia target zero new Ebola cases in 60 days |5.6728117395799245e+17|http://reut.rs/1DXOdH4
Alexandra Harney|SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s rising demand for healthcare is exposing a chronic shortage of an essential commodity: blood.  . With hospital blood supplies tight, desperate patients are turning to agents known as “blood heads”, who sell certificates that give patients access to state blood banks, creating a black market at the heart of the healthcare system. . “To us patients, buying blood solves our problems,” said Hong, a retired Shanghai civil servant who suffers from myelodysplastic syndrome, a debilitating blood condition. “If there were no blood heads, what would I do?” . The blood “famine”, as it has been dubbed, is an unintended consequence of China’s attempts to restore faith in the nation’s scandal-stained blood supply and encourage people to donate. . In the late 1980s and 1990s, local officials urged farmers to sell their blood and plasma, and an earlier generation of blood heads sold this to hospitals and blood banks. Tens if not hundreds of thousands contracted HIV through unhygienic practices in the process. . A second scandal in 2011 further depressed donations. A young woman who claimed she worked at the Red Cross Society of China posted online pictures of her lavish lifestyle, damaging the image of a charity that helps the government collect blood. . In the mid-1990s, China started shuttering commercial blood stations and in 1998 it introduced a blood donation law, banning the commercial sale of blood and encouraging voluntary donation. It also tightened rules on plasma collection and increased blood testing.  . Chinese law now encourages patients to present a certificate showing that they, friends or relatives have donated blood when they need to tap the national supply. Some hospitals will not provide blood without these certificates.  . The effect has been to penalize chronically ill patients who depend on regular or large transfusions, as well as those who cannot count on family and friends nearby. Chinese law also limits individual whole blood donations to twice a year, and provinces rarely share blood. . To meet demand, a new generation of blood heads have moved in, paying people off the street to donate blood at a state blood bank and selling their donation certificates to those in need. . The blood heads include men like Zhang, a 25-year-old from northeastern Jilin province who late last year stood in a neon yellow puffer jacket outside the Red Cross Center in Beijing. . His terms: 1,000 yuan ($160) for every 100 cc (3.4 fl oz) he gets donated into the blood bank.

Jane Wardell|SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian company has recalled its frozen berry products following a hepatitis A outbreak linked to poor hygiene and water supplies in a Chinese packaging plant, reigniting fears about the safety of the Asian giant’s food exports. . Australian authorities were investigating on Monday after as many as nine people were diagnosed with the disease after eating the Patties Foods Ltd berries, which were grown in Chile and China before being packaged at the Chinese factory.  . “We do expect to see more cases,” Sonya Bennett, senior director of Queensland state’s communicable diseases unit, told reporters.  . Food safety has long been an issue in China, where pollution from rapid industrialization has exacted a heavy toll on soil and water. Poor hygiene in production and packaging plants has also been a problem. . Contamination scandals that led to deaths and serious illnesses have increased the popularity in China of imports of European infant formula, New Zealand milk and Japanese rice.  . More than 11,000 school children in Germany were laid low in October 2012 by diarrhea and vomiting that authorities linked to frozen strawberries imported from China. Chinese authorities refuted those claims. . Australia’s Victoria state government said the contamination in the latest case had been traced back to China. . “The particular risk that we’ve identified here is that a country that has endemic hepatitis A, that is China, has been involved with packing these berries,” Finn Romanes, the health department’s senior medical adviser, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.  . “Clearly there’s strong evidence that there may have been a contamination during the packing process as they are fully sealed and then transported to Australia.” . It was not immediately known what other products, if any, the Chinese supplier produced for export, he added. . Patties said its routine quality control testing had not shown any problems with the berries, but further testing was being carried out.  . Agricultural lobby group AUSVEG said the case showed the need for stronger testing of imported produce and urged consumers to buy Australian-grown fruit, which is subjected to more stringent tests. . Shares in Patties, which said it was likely to cut ties with the unnamed Chinese supplier, fell 7.7 percent on Monday to A$1.27. . Chief Executive Steven Chaur said it was too early to say whether the recall would impact the company’s finances. . Hepatitis A is a viral disease affecting the liver. It is passed through contact with material that has been contaminated with faeces from an infected person. Symptoms can include nausea and fever.         |Mon Feb 16 01:19:10 +0000 2015||Australian food company recalls berries after hep A outbreak linked to China |5.6713103736989696e+17|http://reut.rs/1DWuXKa
|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled late on Friday that AstraZeneca PLC’s patent on its Pulmicort Repsules treatment for asthma was invalid, opening up the market to a second, cheaper generic version. . Actavis Plc said that the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruling prompted it to release a generic version of the lung drug. Another generic version of Pulmicort Respules from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, under a previous agreement with AstraZeneca, has been on the market for some time.  . Total branded and generic sales of Pulmicort over the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 were approximately $1.1 billion, according to Actavis.      . Paul Hudson, president of AstraZeneca’s U.S. operations, said that the company strongly disagreed with the court’s decision and that it is considering legal options, including an appeal.  . In April 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey invalidated AstraZeneca’s patent on its Pulmicort treatment, but that ruling was reversed and remanded in October 2013 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  . AstraZeneca said the decision would not have an impact on its 2015 guidance of a mid single-digits percent decline in sales revenue and a low single-digit percent gain in core earnings per share, assuming currency exchange rates remain constant. |Mon Feb 16 01:19:10 +0000 2015||AstraZeneca's patent on asthma drug invalidated by U.S. court |5.671310355537879e+17|http://reut.rs/1FQqGab
Alexandra Harney|SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s rising demand for healthcare is exposing a chronic shortage of an essential commodity: blood.  . With hospital blood supplies tight, desperate patients are turning to agents known as “blood heads”, who sell certificates that give patients access to state blood banks, creating a black market at the heart of the healthcare system. . “To us patients, buying blood solves our problems,” said Hong, a retired Shanghai civil servant who suffers from myelodysplastic syndrome, a debilitating blood condition. “If there were no blood heads, what would I do?” . The blood “famine”, as it has been dubbed, is an unintended consequence of China’s attempts to restore faith in the nation’s scandal-stained blood supply and encourage people to donate. . In the late 1980s and 1990s, local officials urged farmers to sell their blood and plasma, and an earlier generation of blood heads sold this to hospitals and blood banks. Tens if not hundreds of thousands contracted HIV through unhygienic practices in the process. . A second scandal in 2011 further depressed donations. A young woman who claimed she worked at the Red Cross Society of China posted online pictures of her lavish lifestyle, damaging the image of a charity that helps the government collect blood. . In the mid-1990s, China started shuttering commercial blood stations and in 1998 it introduced a blood donation law, banning the commercial sale of blood and encouraging voluntary donation. It also tightened rules on plasma collection and increased blood testing.  . Chinese law now encourages patients to present a certificate showing that they, friends or relatives have donated blood when they need to tap the national supply. Some hospitals will not provide blood without these certificates.  . The effect has been to penalize chronically ill patients who depend on regular or large transfusions, as well as those who cannot count on family and friends nearby. Chinese law also limits individual whole blood donations to twice a year, and provinces rarely share blood. . To meet demand, a new generation of blood heads have moved in, paying people off the street to donate blood at a state blood bank and selling their donation certificates to those in need. . The blood heads include men like Zhang, a 25-year-old from northeastern Jilin province who late last year stood in a neon yellow puffer jacket outside the Red Cross Center in Beijing. . His terms: 1,000 yuan ($160) for every 100 cc (3.4 fl oz) he gets donated into the blood bank. All he needs - beyond money - is a day’s notice, the name of the hospital and the blood type of the patient. . Periodic crackdowns on blood heads appear to have had only limited effect. “Don’t worry about the police. We’re outside most of the hospitals and we know all the police officers,” Zhang said. Two police cars were parked nearby. . Patients such as Hong, whose son asked that her full name not be used for fear that the hospital would deny her a bed if its practices were exposed, are nothing but grateful. .

|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A day before the open enrollment deadline for private health coverage under Obamacare, some consumers were unable to submit applications because of “intermittent issues” with income verification, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department said on Saturday. . The agency, which announced the problem in a statement on Saturday afternoon, said nearly six hours later that it had been resolved ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline. . The department did not say how many people were affected. It said in a statement that it had worked with the Internal Revenue Service to fix the problem. . The department said consumers who were affected should log into their account on the HealthCare.gov website and click on their 2015 application to finish it and complete their enrollment for coverage.  . “Starting tomorrow, we will be reaching out to those consumers who were unable to complete their application to let them know they should come back to HealthCare.gov or contact the call center to complete their enrollment,” the agency said. . The department said anyone who was unable to submit an application because their income could not be verified due to this or any other technical problem will receive an extension for enrollment. . A senior U.S. health official said last week that nearly 7.5 million people had signed up for 2015 Obamacare health plans through the federal exchange, and that demand was increasing as the Feb. 15 deadline approached. . Enrollment for individual plans, created as part of Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, opened for the second year of coverage on Nov. 15. The plans are sold on HealthCare.gov for 37 states. The other 13 states plus Washington, D.C., run their own websites. . The Obama administration said on Monday that 2015 Obamacare subsidies are averaging $268 a month for people in the 37 states who have qualified for federal assistance. .

|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Crowds destroyed an Ebola facility and attacked health workers in central Guinea on rumors that the Red Cross was planning to disinfect a school, a government spokesman said on Saturday. . Red Cross teams in Guinea have been attacked on average 10 times a month over the past year, the organization said this week, warning that the violence was hampering efforts to contain the disease. . During the incident on Friday in the town of Faranah, around 400 km (250 miles) east of the capital Conakry, angry residents attacked an Ebola transit center and set ablaze a vehicle belonging to medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres. . A Red Cross burial team was also targeted and forced to flee, said Fodé Tass Sylla, spokesman for the government campaign against the disease. . “All this agitation aims to discourage our partners and to give the virus the upper hand. We won’t accept that,” he said. “Everyone must understand that the fight we are leading requires the engagement of all citizens.”  . The number of new cases in Guinea nearly doubled last week to 64, according to World Health Organization data, jeopardizing a government plan to get to zero new cases by early March. . Over 2,000 people have died out of a total of around 3,000 cases of Ebola in Guinea, which along with Sierra Leone and Liberia is one of the three countries hardest hit by the worst epidemic of the disease on record.  |Sat Feb 14 12:46:35 +0000 2015||Crowds attack Ebola facility, health workers in Guinea |5.665792547341189e+17|http://reut.rs/1Bay2pT
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California public health officials have confirmed three more cases of measles in an outbreak that began in late December, bringing to 113 the total number of people believed to have been infected in the state. . Health officials in Arizona, where seven cases of measles have been documented, said the outbreak would likely be considered over in that state if no further infections were reported over the weekend. . Across the United States, more than 150 people have been diagnosed with measles, many of them linked to an outbreak that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December. . The California Department of Public Health said 39 of the 113 people who contracted measles in the state were believed to have been exposed while visiting Disneyland. An additional 34 had contacts with those people in a household or community setting. . Forty cases stemmed from an unknown source of exposure, the department said. . Earlier this week, health officials warned tens of thousands of commuters on San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit system that they may have been exposed to measles after an infectious LinkedIn worker rode the train to and from work for three days. . That rider, who also spent time at a San Francisco restaurant and bar, represented the first case of measles confirmed in Contra Costa County. . In Arizona, Will Humble, the state’s director of health services, said the outbreak appeared to be largely winding down in that state because no “third-generation” cases had yet surfaced. . “Measles can take up to 21 days to develop in a person who has been exposed to the disease, so we’re not out of the woods quite yet ... but if we don’t get any new cases by Valentine’s Day, this outbreak is likely over for Arizona,” Humble said in a message on the health department’s website. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. |Sat Feb 14 00:14:42 +0000 2015||California has three new measles cases, Arizona says outbreak winding down |5.663900381375406e+17|http://reut.rs/1B8yg0X
Sinead Carew|(Reuters) - Genetic Technologies Ltd’s (. ) (. ) U.S.-listed shares closed up 30 percent on Friday, capping a two-and-a-half week spate of heavy trading during which its market valuation increased by 533 percent. . U.S. shares in the Australian genetic testing company closed at $8.04 on Friday on no apparent news during the day. They rose as much as 54.6 percent earlier in the session to touch a nearly 12-month high of $9.49 per share. . The stock closed at $1.27 on Jan. 28, a day before the company announced that up to six new breast cancer diagnosis and treatment centers were expected to begin offering its BREVAGenplus product to at-risk patients between January and March. It describes BREVAGenplus as an enhanced version of its breast cancer assessment test. . “It hit a tipping point because of their news announcement and people noticed so they got the volume and it increased in price and after that it just snowballed,” said John Kirkland, managing director at Ironridge Global Partners in San Francisco. . Ironridge is Genetic Technologies’ biggest institutional shareholder, according to Reuters data based on the latest public ownership reports. . Kirkland said that while the news was not very significant, Genetic Technologies “was so unwatched it was the tree falling in the woods. The moment somebody paid attention to it, it just exploded.” . Genetic Technologies saw a 751-fold spike in trading volume on Jan. 29, when 39.69 million shares changed hands compared with 52,834 shares in the previous session, and its shares almost tripled to $3.61.  . In the last 12 days, volume has averaged 14.5 million shares compared with its 12-day average of just over 80,000 for Jan. 28.

Dave Sherwood|AUGUSTA, Maine (Reuters) - Maine Governor Paul LePage has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in a dispute with the federal government over the state’s effort to trim some young people from its Medicaid rolls. . In a 172-page petition, the Republican LePage administration questioned a lower court ruling that affirmed the federal government decision to reject the state’s plan to cut 19- and 20-year-olds from Medicaid. . “The federal government’s path of reckless welfare spending is one that we decline to pursue,” Maine Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew said on Friday. . A judge for the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in November that Maine’s move would violate President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform law, the Affordable Care Act, citing a provision that ensures “children do not lose health insurance as the country transitions from the pre-ACA Medicaid regime to the post-ACA Medicaid regime.” . Medicaid is a government health insurance program for low-income and disabled people. . Maine is one of several states that have challenged Obamacare, as the healthcare reform law is known, and congressional Republicans, bolstered by big wins in November elections, have renewed attacks on the law. . The state contends that the federal government has run afoul of a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that allowed each U.S. state to decide whether to accept the expansion. . Following that ruling, 22 states, including Maine, have declined to expand Medicaid. . LePage, who campaigned on a platform of welfare reform, was re-elected in November after handily beating Democratic challenger and five-term U.S. Representative Mike Michaud. . His administration has long argued that welfare funds should be directed toward “the truly needy, not job-ready adults.” . Cutting the Medicaid rolls would have saved Maine $3.7 million, according to the LePage administration, which has sought to slash hundreds of millions of dollars in healthcare spending overall. |Fri Feb 13 21:50:43 +0000 2015||Maine Governor LePage asks top U.S. court to weigh in on Medicaid fight |5.663538039903027e+17|http://reut.rs/1FIrzl8
Randi Belisomo|It’s something we do to job applicants, first dates, former lovers and the quiet co-worker in the next cubicle. The practice of “googling” others for professional reasons or out of personal curiosity is so ubiquitous that the name of the popular Internet search engine has turned into a verb. In healthcare, patients often head online for diagnoses, drug information and details about their doctors. But do professional standards prevent physicians from doing the same to patients? . The authors of a new paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine write that sometimes, the practice is acceptable. Most other times, in their opinion, it isn’t. They hope their paper sparks conversation among colleagues and the American Medical Association about the possibility of guidelines for providers in the digital age, one in which most medical students can’t remember a world without search engines.  . “The motivation is to protect patients and prevent harm,” said Maria Baker, a Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute genetics counselor.  . Her paper lists 10 situations when physicians are justified in “googling” patients – for example, when they have a duty to warn of possible harm, if patient’s story seem improbable, if information from other professionals calls a patient’s story into question, if there are suspicions of abuse or concerns of suicide risk.  . “There is something worth protecting in the physician-patient relationship,” said co-author Daniel George, an assistant professor in Medical Humanities at Penn State University College of Medicine. While the AMA has issued guidelines regarding physician professionalism and social media, George calls patient-targeted web searches a “blind spot” among providers.  . The authors detail actual situations at Penn State when they felt “googling” was warranted. In one case, a 26-year-old requested that both of her breasts be removed to prevent breast cancer, although she hadn’t undergone genetic testing to see if she was at risk for the disease, and didn’t want to. She reported an “almost unbelievable” family history of breast, ovarian and esophageal cancer and had sought the same surgery at other hospitals.  . The genetic counselor “googled” her and found that this patient “was presenting her cancer story at lay conferences, giving newspaper interviews, and blogging about her experience as a cancer survivor. Additionally, the patient was raising funds, perhaps fraudulently, to attend a national cancer conference.” . “Armed with this information,” the authors write, “the genetic counselor informed the surgeon, who subsequently told the patient he felt uncomfortable performing the surgery in the absence of formal genetic and psychological testing.”  . Conversely, the authors argue, web searches can undermine trust among patients and providers. “You have a patient wanting to adopt healthy lifestyles, and the doctor helps him on a course of exercise and non-smoking,” Baker explained. “But the doctor ‘googles’ him and sees pictures he posted on Facebook smoking a cigar.”  . Mildred Solomon, president of the Garrison, New York-based bioethics institute The Hastings Center, said she applauds the authors for raising such questions, but their “acceptable” reasons for “googling” patients are far too broad.  . One scenario, “incongruent statements by the patient, or between a patient and family members,” occurs too frequently in clinical settings to justify Internet searches, Solomon said. “There’s too much wiggle room,” she explained, noting that “intention” is what should matter.   . “Why is the physician motivated to do this? Is it going to bring benefit to the patient, or is it something self-serving or out of personal curiosity?” Solomon asked.  . A spokesperson for the AMA declined to comment to Reuters Health, citing the issue as “unresolved” by the organization.   . However, a 2013 policy statement from The Federation of State Medical Boards notes that physician use of digital tools must evolve as do technology and societal trends. It acknowledges the use of “patient-targeted googling” in medical crises, such as attempts to identify unconscious patients in emergency departments. But, according to the policy: “it instead can be linked to curiosity, voyeurism and habit. Although anecdotal reports highlight some benefit (for example, intervening when a patient is blogging about suicide), real potential exists for blurring professional and personal boundaries.”   . Authors say they wish only for more dialogue about this digital practice.  . “I think this is just a starting point,” George said. “Every conversation has to start with something. This is the raw clay that we hope the field sculpts into set guidelines.”  . The paper, which first came online in September, appears in the journal’s January print issue. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|Both members of a couple can experience diminished sexual function after a man has prostate cancer surgery, Swiss researchers find, suggesting that treatment should include sex counseling for men and their partners.  . The researchers studied sexual function and satisfaction after men had a type of cancer surgery designed to remove the entire prostate, including semen glands, but protect nearby nerves that are involved in erections.  . “Typically, even with nerve sparing, a man may have difficulties for months before he gets back to a more normal erectile function, and then he will have an orgasm that doesn’t include ejaculation,” said Dr. Vincent Laudone, a urologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study. . “Any treatment that doesn’t involve an up front, detailed discussion with both members of a couple is lacking,” Dr. Laudone said.   . Dr. Christophe Iselin, with the division of urologic surgery at Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland, and colleagues write in the International Journal of Impotence Research that screening is leading to more men, and younger men being treated for prostate cancer. . To assess the effect this may be having on couples’ sexual health, they analyzed data on 21 couples who completed questionnaires about sex before the men had prostate cancer surgery and again six months after the procedure.  . The average age of the study participants was 62.4 for men and 60.7 for women.  . Bilateral nerve sparing, the most effective at preserving erectile function, was done in 12 procedures. The remaining nine operations involved nerve sparing on just one side. . As typically happens with prostate surgery, the men reported decreased erectile function after the fact, with a steeper decline after unilateral nerve sparing. . But the women also reported decreased sexual function after the men had surgery, with declines in desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm and satisfaction.  . “The stress of cancer treatment and the disruption in the couple’s usual pattern of intimacy can leave both partners feeling less interested in sexual activity,” said Dr. Andrea Bradford, an assistant professor of gynecologic oncology and reproductive medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  . Even though women aren’t the ones having surgery, the disruption of their regular sex life in the weeks or months immediately after the man’s operation can make sex more painful when relations resume, said Dr. Bradford, who wasn’t involved in the study. . “The female partners in this study were in mid-life or older, which means most of them were postmenopausal,” Dr. Bradford said. “Regular sexual activity can help prevent or slow the normal vaginal changes that occur after menopause, but after a long period of sexual abstinence women may be surprised to find that they have more difficulties than before with lubrication or genital pain.” . Limitations of the study include the small sample, taken only from couples who agreed to sexual assessments, and the short six-month follow-up period for a procedure that can inhibit erectile function for as long as two to three years, the researchers point out in their report. . Going beyond the mechanics of sexual function, the study team also looked at how satisfied couples were with their relationships. The couples reported a dip in satisfaction six months after surgery, but the decline wasn’t statistically significant. . While other studies have found that relationships aren’t affected in those first months, longer-term studies have shown declines in sexual and emotional intimacy as well as relationship satisfaction, said Dr. Daniela Whittmann, a clinical assistant professor of urology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  . “Partners are still not sufficiently included in discussions surrounding prostate cancer treatment,” said Dr. Whittmann, who wasn’t involved in the study. . Even with other forms of cancer, treatment can affect sexual function and relationships, she said. . “We’re talking about fatigue, nausea, baldness, changes of the mucous membranes, poor blood flow, loss of body parts, etcetera,” Dr. Whittmann said. “All of these affect sexual health. Couples need preparation for sexual changes which they have to manage not only physically, but also emotionally.” . SOURCE: .  .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – Three daily doses of glucosamine and chondroitin may provide the same relief as a smaller dose of prescription celecoxib for people with severe pain from osteoarthritis, according to a randomized trial in four European countries. . In the U.S., glucosamine and chondroitin are available as over-the-counter supplements so their formulations are not regulated like the prescription European version. . “The Europeans have an advantage on us in this regard as glucosamine, chondroitin and the combination are all available as medications,” said Dr. Allen Sawitzke of the Rheumatology Division at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, a coauthor of the new study. . “As such, their reliable composition and chemistry are more like assured,” he told Reuters Health by email. . The U.S. supplement versions are less reliable in quality and quantity, Sawitzke said. . The new trial included 606 patients over age 40 with moderate to severe pain from knee osteoarthritis living in France, Germany, Poland or Spain.  . Osteoarthritis, or wear and tear of the joints, affects more than a third of adults over age 65 in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is no cure. Treatments include physical therapy, medication and joint replacement. . The study participants were randomly divided into two groups, one taking a daily combination of 400 milligrams chondroitin sulfate and 500 mg glucosamine hydrochloride (Droglican, made by Bioiberica S.A.). The other group took 200 mg of celecoxib (marketed by Pfizer as Celebrex, Celebra, Onsenal and others) every day. . After six months, both groups had knee pain about half as severe as when they started, and similar reductions in joint swelling and stiffness and increased function, according to results in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. . In U.S. drugstores, a three-month supply of glucosamine and chondroitin supplement costs around $30. Prescription celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain reliever, can cost $130 per month, much more expensive than over-the-counter pain relievers, according to Consumer Reports. . Both glucosamine and chondroitin are available by prescription in Europe, but some advise against using them for osteoarthritis due to lack of evidence, the authors note. . But the new study suggests that in combination they can be effective for osteoarthritis patients, especially for people with heart or gastrointestinal problems who may not be able to take an NSAID like celecoxib, the authors write. . Celecoxib can cause serious side effects like high fever, noted coauthor Dr. Yves Henrotin, head of the Bone and Cartilage Research Unit at the University of Liège in Belgium. It can also cause ulcers and bleeding, according to the National Institutes of Health. . “My recommendation is to consider a patient’s (other diseases) before treatment,” Henrotin told Reuters Health by phone.  . “For countries where the prescription preparations are available, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate appears to be as effective and at least as safe so might be the preferred way to start,” Sawitzke said. It may be considered in other countries as well, but will have to be monitored closely through the first months of use, he said. . However, the prescription glucosamine and chondroitin formulation in this European study cannot be generalized to the dietary supplement versions available in the U.S. and U.K., they emphasize. . “I think many U.S. providers have quit recommending a trial of the glucosamine and chondroitin to patients affected by osteoarthritis as strong support was not available,” Sawitzke said. “In distinction, the European market has remained strong and the guidelines actually recommend their use.” . “We still have to consider financial constraints, a given patient’s adverse events risks, and the risks of the unknown in the over-the-counter market,” he said. .

Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) – Swinging heavy kettlebells may offer an aerobic workout in addition to strength improvements, a small study suggests. . Female soccer players who trained with kettlebells for one month significantly increased their aerobic capacity, while traditional circuit weight training did not have the same effect, California researchers found. . Theirs is one of the first studies to find the effects of kettlebell training over time, said study leader J. Asher Falatic, of the Kinesiology department at San José State University. . Kettlebells are circular weights with handles at the top. They’ve been used for centuries but have gained popularity recently, according to Alexander Koch, program coordinator for exercise science at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina. . “Because of its shape, it differs from a traditional dumbbell and can be used to help train multiple parts of the body,” Falatic said in an email. . He and his colleagues measured the effect of kettlebell exercise on aerobic capacity, which is the ability of the heart and lungs to consume oxygen and deliver it to the muscles.  . “Aerobic capacity, also known as fitness, is an important predictor of health and longevity,” said Lars Andersen, a professor of musculoskeletal disorders at The National Research Centre for the Working Environment in Denmark, who was not involved in the study.  . Seventeen female NCAA Division I college soccer players participated in the study. Nine were placed in the kettlebell group and eight in a comparison group that did circuit training instead.  . The groups were not randomly assigned. Women were included in the kettlebell group only if they showed proper technique for the “snatch” exercise - swinging the weight down between the legs and then lifting it up over the head, alternating between arms. The researchers write in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research that this was done to prevent injury. . Both groups trained for 20 minutes, three days a week, in addition to their usual off-season training. . The circuit training involved multiple free-weight and body-weight exercises including squats, sit-ups and sprints. The kettlebell group did the snatch exercise. . After four weeks, aerobic capacity in the kettlebell group rose by 6 percent but didn’t change significantly in the circuit training group. . The authors say the results might only apply to athletes or people with some kettlebell experience. Earlier studies in relatively inactive people did not show significant improvement.  . Still, Koch said, kettlebells can be used at any fitness level. A popular recommendation is a starting weight of 16 kilograms (about 35 pounds) for men and 12kg (about 26 lbs) for women of “average fitness level.” . He warns, however, “Kettlebells are not a magic bullet, they are simply one viable option people have to exercise with to increase their aerobic capacity.”  . Kettlebells are an alternative to traditional aerobic fitness such as running, he said, and “finding exercise modes one enjoys is the key to building a lifelong habit of movement and optimal health.” .

Misha Hussain|CONAKRY (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Parents have taken their children out of school in some parts of the Guinean capital this week, less than a month after schools reopened, because of fears the Red Cross is spreading the Ebola virus on campus, the humanitarian agency said. . Parents took their children out of school in the Matam area of Conakry on Wednesday, a day after children were removed from their schools in the Ratoma area, the Red Cross said. . “They are accusing us of infecting the schools with Ebola and vaccinating the children, but we have never entered the schools and we have never vaccinated children,” said Youssouf Traore, president of the Red Cross Society of Guinea. . “We only disinfect the homes and places where sick Ebola victims have been and then only with the permission of their family and community,” Traore told the Thomson Reuters Foundation late on Thursday. . The worst ever outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 9,100 people, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. . Efforts to wipe out the deadly virus are being hampered by people’s mistrust of health workers, and by the number of people still hiding sick friends and relatives from authorities, particularly in the Guinean capital Conakry, officials say. . The school term normally starts in October in Guinea, but the government delayed the reopening of schools until Jan. 19 in an effort to contain the virus, which causes vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding, and is spread by contact with bodily fluids. . The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, said some 47,500 kits containing buckets and soap have been distributed along with 20,500 infrared thermometers. It said around 80,000 teachers have received information and training on prevention. . About 1.3 million children have returned to school in Guinea, but the United Nations said this week that 70 schools across the country had been unable to open because of suspicions about the medical kits being distributed to students. . UNICEF said children dropping out of school could have a long-term impact on both their education and the ability to control the epidemic because pupils are being taught at school how to protect themselves and their families against the virus. . “From our experience in different emergency contexts, the longer children stay out of school, the less likely they are to return,” said Sayo Aoki, education specialist in Ebola emergencies for UNICEF. . “Ebola has hit poor families very strongly, so it is possible that those poor families are more vulnerable than before and require their children to support the family economically,” Aoki told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  . Schools are due to reopen in Liberia on Monday and in Sierra Leone at the end of March, UNICEF said. |Fri Feb 13 16:28:46 +0000 2015||Parents take children out of school in Guinea over Ebola fears: Red Cross |5.6627278284640666e+17|http://reut.rs/1FHn2iE

|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Japan’s Eisai Co Ltd’s drug to treat the most common form of thyroid cancer more than two months ahead of the review date. . The drug, Lenvima, was cleared for use in patients with progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who have not adequately responded to radioactive iodine therapy, the agency said on Friday. (. ) . DTC is a cancerous growth of the thyroid gland, which is located in the neck, and helps regulate metabolism. . Lenvima, known chemically as lenvatinib, is a kinase inhibitor that blocks certain proteins from helping cancer cells grow and divide. The drug is also being tested for use in a plethora of other cancers. . The drug, which was granted “orphan drug status” by the U.S. regulator, was evaluated by the agency under its priority review program. This process expedites review of drugs that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the treatment of a serious condition. . The FDA was slated to make a decision on Lenvima by April 14. . The approval is backed by data that showed Lenvima-treated patients lived a median of 18.3 months without their disease progressing, compared to a median of 3.6 months for patients who received a placebo. . Lenvima will be sold in the United States by Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based Eisai Inc, a unit of Tokyo-based Eisai. . Last year, about 62,980 Americans were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and at least 1,890 succumbed to the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. .

Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has seen a sharp rise in the number of swine flu deaths and reported cases this year, prompting officials to investigate the cause and step up efforts to combat the virus. . The H1N1 virus caused 485 deaths in India between Jan. 1 and Feb. 12, additional health secretary Arun Kumar Panda told reporters on Friday.  . He said more than 6,000 people had tested positive for the virus during that time.  . “There is no explanation or reason,” Panda said. “We will ask states to investigate why the number of cases is rising.” . In 2009-10, the H1N1 swine flu pandemic spread from central Mexico to 74 other countries including India, killing an estimated 284,000 people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  . More than 2,700 died in India of swine flu between May 2009 and December 2010. Last year, India recorded 218 swine flu-related deaths and 937 cases, down from 2013, when 699 died. . On Wednesday the government said it had placed an order to increase the national stock of diagnostic kits to test for the virus. Authorities are also procuring 10,000 additional masks and 60,000 doses of the anti-viral drug Oseltamivir. . The government plans to draft guidelines for vaccination of healthcare workers. Panda, however, dismissed reports there was any widespread shortage of medicines to fight swine flu. . Panda said there were usually more H1N1 cases in winter and he expected the number to drop in the coming weeks. . “It is a matter of worry, but not a matter of panic,” said a health ministry official, who did not wish to be named. |Fri Feb 13 13:51:24 +0000 2015||India sees rapid rise in swine flu deaths and cases |5.662331785880822e+17|http://reut.rs/1B64wBJ
Lisa Anderson|NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Human stem cells engineered to produce renewable sources of mature, liver-like cells can be grown and infected with malaria to test potentially life-saving new drugs, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  . The advance comes at a time when the parasitic mosquito-borne disease, which kills nearly 600,000 people every year, is showing increased resistance to current treatment, especially in Southeast Asia, according to the World Health Organization.   . The liver-like cells, or hepatocytes, in the MIT study were manufactured from stem cells derived from donated skin and blood samples. . The resulting cells provide a potentially replenishable platform for testing drugs that target the early stage of malaria, when parasites may linger and multiply in the liver for weeks before spreading into the bloodstream. . Sangeeta Bhatia, a biomedical engineer and senior author of the MIT report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the breakthrough study not only showed that these liver-like cells could host a malaria infection but also described a way to mature the young cells so that an adult-like metabolism, necessary for drug development, could be established. . The study is published in the Feb. 5 online issue of Stem Cell Reports.  . Stem cells retain the genetic makeup of their donors, affording researchers the potential to test drugs against a large variety of genetic types and a variety of diseases.  . “This allows us to explore in depth how different diseases affect different people, in this case malaria,”  Bob Palay, chairman and CEO of Cellular Dynamics International (CDI), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   . “This allows you to study it in a dish and find new drugs,” he added, noting that CDI uses blood samples for its stem cells. . Before this development, researchers tested new drugs using human liver cells from cadavers and cancerous liver cells. . “In both cases, they don’t work as well, not the same thing as healthy living cells,” said Palay.  . Malaria, caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites, causes fever, chills and other flu-like symptoms and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early.  . Key ways to prevent malaria include insecticide-treated mosquito nets for beds and indoor spraying with insecticides. . There were about 198 million cases of malaria in 2013, according to the latest WHO estimates. . Malaria mortality rates have dropped by nearly half globally and by 54 percent in Africa since 2000, but the WHO estimated that a child in Africa dies every minute from the disease.      |Fri Feb 13 13:33:27 +0000 2015||Stem cells offer promising key to new malaria drugs: U.S. research |5.66228660630614e+17|http://reut.rs/1FGPpxo
Tom Miles|GENEVA (Reuters) - Eleven people who had contact with the Philippines’ first confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are also showing symptoms, the World Health Organisation said on Friday. . “Eleven contacts are symptomatic. It’s a mix of family contacts and hospital contacts, the doctors and nurses who attended the case before she was tested and found positive,” said Peter Ben Embarek, a scientist at the WHO’s department of food safety and zoonoses.  . The patient, a 32-year-old nurse, returned from Saudi Arabia on Feb. 1 and was hospitalized the next day. The Philippines Health Ministry said on Wednesday she had tested positive for the disease, which has been linked to camels. . The World Health Organisation is still trying to track down more than half the people who were on the same Saudia airline flight from Riyadh to Manila. . “So far close to 100 of the 225 passengers have been identified and contacted,” said Embarek. . None of the nurse’s fellow travelers who have been traced has shown symptoms and the risk to them is small, but all passengers who have not yet been contacted should present themselves to health authorities, he said.   . “The closer you are to a case, of course, the higher the risk of transmission. Generally on a plane transmission is very rare because the air is recycled very quickly and people are not moving around much. Unless you are within a few rows of the case the risk is extremely low.”  . Health authorities are already monitoring 56 people considered to have had contact with the nurse. . The WHO will send a mission to Riyadh next week at the request of the Saudi government, which has been battling the disease since it emerged in 2012, the WHO said.  . Nine countries in the Middle East have had confirmed cases while 13 others, now including the Philippines, have had travel-associated cases, or cases they have diagnosed but which originated overseas. . The WHO has had reports of 975 cases, including 358 deaths. There is usually a surge of cases in the spring, and after the last large outbreak in May-June 2014, most cases have come from hospital transmission.  . Embarek said it was difficult to stop the spread in health facilities because the infection was probably passed on while people were being initially checked and triaged with flu-like symptoms, which were not easily recognized as MERS. . It was unclear if MERS could spread while a patient was in isolation or if some medical devices could transmit it, he said. |Fri Feb 13 13:33:22 +0000 2015||Eleven people linked to Philippines MERS case show symptoms: WHO |5.6622864199530086e+17|http://reut.rs/1B61hdD
Kieran Guilbert|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Healthcare professionals and teachers in England and Wales who fail to report cases of female genital mutilation in children could be fired under a new law which campaigners said was vital to protect girls at risk. . Doctors, nurses, social workers and teachers will have to report cases of FGM in girls under the age of 18 to police within a month of discovering them, under proposed legislation expected to be passed before a general election on May 7. . Those who fail to do so will face internal disciplinary measures or be referred to their professional regulator, and could be fired and barred from practicing. . An estimated 137,000 women and girls in England and Wales have undergone FGM, the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons, which can cause serious physical and psychological problems and complications in childbirth. . The traditional practice is widespread in Africa and found in parts of the Middle East and Asia. . “It will send a clear message to perpetrators that they will be held responsible for their actions and help prevent this appalling crime from happening,” Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said in a statement. . The law will give professionals the confidence to confront FGM, help police investigations and increase the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted, she said. . It will apply in all cases of known FGM in under 18s, whether disclosed by the victim or seen by the professional. . Mary Wandia, FGM program manager at women’s rights organization Equality Now, said the law was urgently needed to better equip frontline professionals who meet girls at risk. . “This approach is not about sending people to prison, it’s about knowing how to best protect girls who need us to stand with them,” Wandia said in a statement.   . Tanya Barron, chief executive of children’s charity Plan UK, said it was crucial that authorities had the right policies and procedures in place to protect girls at risk of FGM and support those affected. . Identifying victims is an important part of this process, Barron said. . The proposed law follows controversy over Britain’s first FGM prosecution earlier this month, which ended in the acquittal of the defendants amid claims they had been made scapegoats in a show trial. . The case, which centered on the way a doctor had stitched a woman after delivering her baby, drew fury from medics who warned that doctors would now be afraid to help women with FGM. . FGM has been a criminal offence in Britain since 1985, but new legislation in 2003 introduced a maximum prison sentence of 14 years and made it an offence for British citizens to carry out or procure FGM abroad, even in countries where it is legal. |Fri Feb 13 13:04:12 +0000 2015||UK professionals face dismissal for failure to report child FGM |5.662213006630707e+17|http://reut.rs/1B5VTqY
David Ljunggren|OTTAWA/CALGARY (Reuters) - Canada confirmed its first case of mad cow disease since 2011 on Friday, but said the discovery should not hit a beef export sector worth C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) a year. . The news, however, helped boost U.S. cattle prices. . The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said no part of the animal, a beef cow from Alberta, had reached the human food or animal feed systems. . Mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a progressive, fatal neurological disease. It is thought that the disease can be transmitted to people from food made from cows sick with BSE.  . “The CFIA is seeking to confirm the age of the animal, its history and how it became infected. The investigation will focus in on the feed supplied to this animal during the first year of its life,” the agency said. . Canadian exports were badly hit in 2003 after the first case of BSE in Canada was detected. Canada subsequently tightened its controls, and many nations have since resumed the beef trade with Canada, despite the discovery of more cases since then. . Asked whether he was concerned about exports being harmed, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz told reporters in Calgary: “Not at this time, no.” . He added, however, that markets in South Korea and Japan were generally very concerned about the potential risk from BSE.  . A fresh discovery of BSE may not close borders to beef, given the tougher measures, but it could delay Canada’s efforts to upgrade its international risk status from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). . An OIE spokeswoman said the discovery and reporting of the case showed the surveillance system was working. She said Canada had a “controlled risk” status, which would not be endangered by the discovery. . A CFIA official told reporters that Canada would not be allowed to upgrade to the “negligible risk” status unless it could prove that any diseased cow found was at least 11 years old. He said the agency was still investigating the cow’s age. . Ritz said Canada’s current OIE risk status meant it could report up to 12 outbreaks in a calendar year. . On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the news initially helped drive up live cattle contracts for delivery beginning this spring by as much as 2 percent. . The market rallied in part because of the prospect of less beef coming across the border, said Joe Ocrant, president of Oak Investment Group in Chicago. . BSE is believed to spread when cattle eat protein rendered from the brains and spines of infected cattle or sheep. Canada banned that practice in 1997. . The CFIA tightened feed rules in 2007 and said this should help eliminate the disease nationally within a decade, although the agency said it still expected to discover an occasional new case. . Dave Solverson, president of the Canadian Cattlemen’s Association, said that in previous outbreaks there had rarely been more than one infected animal on an individual farm. . “It’s very unlikely there will be more cases found,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. .

Anastasia Moloney|BOGOTA/ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ordering fried chicken at a fast-food restaurant in Colombia’s capital, Paola Flores is one of millions of Latin Americans struggling with obesity, an epidemic hitting this region harder than others in the developing world. . More than 56 percent of Latin American adults are overweight or obese, compared to a global average of 34 percent, according to a report by the Overseas Development Institute last year. . The growing problem often affects the poorest in society, and threatens to overwhelm Latin America’s public health systems and curtail economic gains in the long run, experts say. . “Buying a family combo of fried chicken, chips and a soft drink can feed me and my three children at a price I can afford,” Flores, a secretary, said as she stood in line. . Since 1991, the number of hungry people in Latin America has nearly halved to 37 million in December from 68.5 million. While the region is the only one that is on track to meet U.N. goals on reducing hunger by 2015, far less attention has been paid to combating obesity. . In the past decade, fast-growing economies buoyed by a commodities boom, including Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, have seen a rising middle class with a taste for more processed food that are high in salt, sugar and fat. . Aid in the form of cash transfers, pioneered by some of the region’s left-leaning governments, particularly Brazil, mean people have more money to spend on food. . Governments and nutrition programs now need to focus on ensuring people buy more foods high in fiber and protein, such as fruits and vegetables, U.N. officials said. . “In the past, the main problem we had in Latin America was under-nutrition. We tried to spend efforts on school feeding programs and supplements for families,” said Yenory Hernandez-Garbanzo from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). . “Now, we have to look at the bigger picture. We were feeding these families with a lot of energy but we weren’t teaching them how to be balanced in their diets,” the nutrition officer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . Obesity is the fastest-growing chronic disease, killing 2.8 million adults every year. Obesity-related conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, now cause more deaths than hunger, according to the World Economic Forum.   . “Rapidly rising rates of obesity in Latin America and worldwide bring huge social challenges and places a tremendous burden on the individuals affected, as well as the global economy and public healthcare systems,” said Florencia Vasta, a specialist at the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition. . Mexico faces the region’s most acute obesity crisis, with 70 percent of adults overweight or obese, according to Mexico’s National Institute for Public Health (INSP). . “Obesity in some countries in Latin America, like Mexico, is an epidemic where extreme measures need to be taken,” Juan Rivera, head of INSP’s health and nutrition research center, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . Obesity cost the Mexican economy an estimated $5.5 billion in 2008, he said, and if the problem is not addressed, the figure is expected to hit $12.5 billion by 2017.  . To combat obesity, which Mexico has declared a public health priority, lawmakers have introduced measures to promote exercise and healthy eating, such as free subway rides if passengers perform 10 squats and a 2014 tax on sugary drinks and junk food. . Other measures include banning unhealthy food from school cafeterias and require all schools to provide water fountains to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks. . Costa Rica, Uruguay and Colombia have also introduced similar initiatives to promote healthy food in schools, while Ecuador has introduced controls on food labeling.  . “Mexico has taken good steps in its fight against obesity during this and the previous administration but there’s still much ground to cover,” Rivera said. . Experts say one reason why obesity is such a problem in Latin America stems from the power of multinational food and beverage firms, particularly those from the United States. . “One of the biggest issues here is the influence of the food industry,” FAO nutrition expert Melissa Vargas said. “They have ... a lot of political influence and money for advertising.” |Fri Feb 13 11:50:00 +0000 2015||Obesity weighs on Latin America after success in fight against hunger |5.66202627588096e+17|http://reut.rs/1FGyQBX
James Pearson|SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a note to foreign diplomats and organizations in Pyongyang warning them not to hold parties or meetings in violation of its strict quarantine against the deadly Ebola virus. . North Korea, the world’s most isolated country, is thousands of miles from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and has reported no cases of the virus, which has killed more than 9,000 people. . Nonetheless, its borders have remained closed to foreign tourists since last October, for fear the virus might spread, and it imposes a strict 21-day quarantine for foreign aid workers and diplomats, who have been told to stay in embassy compounds. . “Among a very few members of the diplomatic corps in the DPRK, some people in quarantine continue to host or participate in a banquet, a party or a meeting,” read the note, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. . DPRK is the abbreviation of North Korea’s official title,  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The note, dated Feb. 2, went to embassies and international organizations in Pyongyang, diplomatic sources confirmed to Reuters. . On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama said he would bring back by April 30 nearly all of the U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic, after evidence showed a drop in new cases. . But in North Korea, even high-ranking Party cadres have been quarantined. Its titular head of state, Kim Yong Nam, was quarantined upon his return from a trip to Africa last November, a South Korean government official said last month.  . The policy “will not change in the least until the danger of Ebola virus infection disappears”, the note stated. . People working in North Korea’s tourism industry told Reuters they had not yet been told when the tourism ban would be lifted, but expected to be able to resume tours in time for the Pyongyang marathon this April. .

Krista Hughes|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Doctors and health professionals from both sides of the Pacific on Thursday said they worry that a major regional trade pact could result in higher medical costs and urged a full assessment of the pact’s impact on healthcare. . In a letter to be published in The Lancet medical journal, academics and medical associations from seven of the 12 countries negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership voiced their concerns over the deal, which seeks to cut tariffs and set common standards on intellectual property. . “Rising medicine costs would disproportionately affect already vulnerable populations, obstructing efforts to improve health equity within and between countries,” they wrote in the  letter. . “We call on our governments to publicly release the full (TPP) draft text, and to secure independent and comprehensive assessments of the health and human rights consequences of the proposed agreement for each nation.” . The letter was signed by 27 academics, doctors and health professionals, including the heads of the Public Health Association of Australia, the Public Health Association of New Zealand, the Canadian Public Health Association, the Vietnam Public Health Association and the Malaysia AIDS Council.  . With the TPP talks nearing completion, one of the thorniest outstanding issues is the monopoly period for biologic drugs, which include some of the latest cancer treatments, such as Roche Holding AG’s Herceptin for breast cancer and Merck & Co’s Gardasil for cervical cancer. . The United States protects biologics for 12 years, while Japan protects them for eight years and Australia for five. Some other countries like Chile have no special protections at all. . The issue is particularly difficult for Australia and New Zealand, which have taxpayer-funded subsidy schemes for medicines. Costs could balloon if cheaper generic drugs are slower to come to market. . Deborah Gleeson, a lecturer at Australia’s La Trobe University and one of the letter’s authors, estimates that generic versions of the 10 most expensive drugs available under that country’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would save more than A$200 million a year.  . The Australian and New Zealand trade ministers have both said they will do nothing to undermine public health programs. . U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Jan. 27 that the United States had argued that data protection can help promote innovation and make sure that drugs come to markets earlier, but acknowledged the issue was “one of the most difficult.” . “Our goal is on one hand to promote innovation and creativity in this country, and also to ensure access to affordable medicines, particularly in developing countries,” he told a congressional hearing. |Fri Feb 13 00:00:33 +0000 2015||Doctors warn of healthcare impact from Pacific trade pact |5.660240897863967e+17|http://reut.rs/1FEJbOP
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Northern California commuter who health officials say may have exposed tens of thousands of people to measles while riding San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit system while infectious is an employee of LinkedIn Corp, the social networking company said on Thursday. . The passenger, who commuted to and from LinkedIn’s offices in San Francisco on three days last week and also spent time at a San Francisco restaurant and bar, represents the first case of measles confirmed in Contra Costa County during an outbreak of the disease that began in December.   . “On Tuesday, Feb. 10, we were informed that an employee based in our San Francisco office was diagnosed with measles. We are working very closely with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and following their recommended protocol for managing this situation,” LinkedIn said in a written statement.  . “The health and well-being of our employees is our absolute top priority, and we will take whatever steps are advised to ensure their safety and the safety of the general public,” the business-oriented social networking site said. . Hani Durzy, director of corporate communications, said the company was keeping its employees informed about the situation but that it was otherwise “business as usual” in its San Francisco offices. The infected employee was doing fine, he said. . Public health officials have sought to assure BART riders that the risk of contracting measles was very low if they had been inoculated, while urging anyone who had not to get the vaccine. . According to the California Department of Public Health, 110 cases of measles have been confirmed in California, 39 of them linked to the outbreak that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December. . More than three dozen more cases have been documented in other U.S. states and in Mexico. Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.  . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of measles cases in 20 years. |Thu Feb 12 22:48:26 +0000 2015||Commuter infected with measles is San Francisco LinkedIn employee |5.66005941368533e+17|http://reut.rs/1B3N1lx
Irene Jay Liu|SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In biotech parks across the Yangtze River Delta, dozens of start-ups are working to develop drugs to treat China’s biggest emerging diseases - from diabetes and Hepatitis B to respiratory illnesses and cancer. . It’s early days, but firms like Hua Medicine and Innovent Biologics embody China’s hopes for competitive biomedical innovation. And their Chinese-born, Western-educated founders represent the long-awaited return of the nation’s brightest life scientists. .     From school in the late 1970s and 1980s, when only elite students gained entry into China’s few biochemistry and molecular biology programs, they left China, graduated and worked their way up to senior positions in the world’s top pharmaceutical companies. .     For decades, China tried to woo them home, but they were reluctant to return to a cloistered, politicized scientific establishment where winning research funds and promotion often depends on who you know. It took the jobs squeeze of the 2008 global financial crisis and fresh government incentives - from state-of-the-art research labs to grants, loans and government venture capital - to prise them from international careers to launch their own start-ups in China. .     “To obtain major grants in China, it’s an open secret that doing good research is not as important as schmoozing with powerful bureaucrats and their favorite experts,” returnees Shi Yigong and Rao Yi wrote in a 2010 editorial in Science. .     “If returnees want to do innovation, in academia there is traditional resistance and old practices,” said Huiyao Wang at the Center for China & Globalization. “It’s the private sector that really attracts people to start new ventures.” .     China has committed more than $300 billion to science and technology, with biotech one of seven pillar industries in the latest Five-Year Plan. Biomedical research investment jumped more than four-fold in 2007-12, though it is still dwarfed by spending in the United States and Europe, according to a 2014 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. .     Returnee firms have listed in New York and London, work closely with ‘Big Pharma’ and attract investment from U.S. venture capital and multinationals. .     “China is coming up, especially with returnees coming back. The innovation will come with the people,” said Jimmy Zhang, a vice-president at Johnson & Johnson Innovation, which opened a regional center in Shanghai last autumn. . “I sometimes ask myself, ‘why did I return to China?’ I had a very comfortable life in the U.S. and my family’s still there,” said Michael Yu, Innovent’s founder and CEO. “But for lots of Chinese men, there’s always something in the heart ... a desire to go back and do something. Biotech has only just started in China so you can have significant impact for a whole industry, for a country.” . After completing postdoctoral training at the University of California, San Francisco, Yu spent a decade at U.S. biotech firms before going home in 2006 to co-found Kanghong Biotech, which developed the first homegrown innovative monoclonal antibody to be approved by China’s regulators. He later launched Innovent with funding from Chinese and U.S.-based investors, including bioBAY, a government-funded biosciences park in Suzhou. bioBAY spent $140 million on Innovent’s 1 million square foot (92,903 square meter) laboratory and production facility. . Another returnee, Li Chen, was chief scientific officer at Roche’s China R&D center when, in 2009, he was invited to dinner by U.S.-based ARCH Venture Partners, which encouraged him to go out on his own. “It wasn’t something I was expecting,” Chen said. He launched Hua Medicine in 2011 with $50 million from U.S. and Chinese investors. Last month, it closed another $25 million in series-B financing. . The returnee start-ups are leveraging shifts in the global R&D landscape. The financial crisis, expiry of blockbuster drug patents, and mega-mergers have forced major drugs firms to reprioritize, giving newcomers a chance to develop promising compounds already in the pipeline. . Hua is about to launch Phase 2 trials for a novel Type 2 diabetes drug in-licensed from Roche. Zai Laboratory, another returnee firm, has an in-licensing deal with Sanofi to develop two compounds to potentially treat chronic respiratory diseases. .     By focusing on diseases that are on the rise in China, these firms can recruit from a vast patient population, speeding up the time it takes to conduct clinical studies. .     However, China’s regulatory environment, especially for drug approval, “has been quite inefficient and often inadequate,” says Jonathan Wang at OrbiMed, a global healthcare-dedicated investment firm. Getting approval for human trials can take over a year, compared to just weeks in the United States.  . “Everything else being equal, you’d go where the approval process is easier,” said Wang. .     For some, coming home is as much a personal as professional issue. Many are ‘empty nesters’ whose own children are now at college, or they have ageing parents. . “In the U.S., people have family and friends who can support them with ‘angel money.’ As first-generation immigrants, we don’t have that kind of access there,” said Zhang at J&J Innovation. . For the returnees, it’s just the beginning. .     “We’ve planted the seed for a fast-growing, innovation driven environment in China,” said Steve Yang, chief operating officer at WuXi AppTec. “The impact of this group will be better measured in another 10-20 years.” |Thu Feb 12 22:12:33 +0000 2015||For many of China's biotech brains-in-exile, it's time to come home |5.6599691025608294e+17|http://reut.rs/1B3FTWi
Shereen Lehman|Researchers may not realize how badly new cancer drugs make patients feel because physicians don’t always accurately report side effects, suggests a new study. . The comparison of side effects reported by patients and their physicians in three separate cancer drug trials found that doctors under-reported by up to 75 percent how many patients had six of the most common chemotherapy side effects. . Lacking accurate estimates of side effects makes it difficult for doctors to discuss the benefits versus risks of new cancer drugs with their patients, the study authors say.  . “Our findings are consistent with previous research data and confirm that patient reported outcomes have to be integrated into cancer clinical trials because they are very important in defining tolerability of new treatments from the patients’ perspective,” senior study author Dr. Francesco Perrone told Reuters Health in an email. . “Patients should be empowered to directly report subjective side effects and be active in defining the tolerability of anticancer drugs,” said Perrone, director of the Clinical Trials Unit at the National Cancer Institute of Naples, Italy. . For their study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Perrone and colleagues reviewed the side effects reported by a total of 1,090 patients from three separate cancer drug trials. One trial was of a secondary treatment for elderly patients with breast cancer and two trials involved new first-line treatments for lung cancer.  . Almost 2,500 treatment cycles were included in the analysis. Trial physicians reported and graded their perceptions of patients’ side effects afterwards, and the patients filled out questionnaires following each cycle that assessed the presence and severity of appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and hair loss.  . When the researchers compared reports from doctors and patients, they found physicians had under-reported loss of appetite by about 75 percent, nausea by about 40 percent, vomiting by about 47 percent, constipation by about 70 percent, diarrhea by about 51 percent and hair loss by about 65 percent. . When the study team focused just on severe side effects that patients reported experiencing “very much,” they found physicians under-reported appetite loss by about 50 percent, nausea by about 26 percent, vomiting by about 13 percent, constipation by about 44 percent, diarrhea by about 24 percent and hair loss by about 43 percent.  . Perrone said the findings show that physicians should be cautious when reading and interpreting the results of clinical trials, particularly if patient reports of subjective side effects are not included.  . The results should also push physicians toward spending more time listening to the patient’s experience of symptoms, he said. . “When I tell somebody what to expect from the side effects standpoint, I really rely on the previously published studies, which are largely based on other clinical investigators reporting out the percentage of things like nausea, pain, hair loss, fatigue and knowing that these side effects may be under-reported, I think is important,” said Dr. Sam Lubner, an oncologist with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. . Lubner, who was not involved in the study, said physicians have criteria for assessing subjective complaints like nausea, pain, and anxiety, but it’s often difficult for patients to describe their levels of discomfort.  . Lubner said patients should ask for a written list of the possible side effects before they begin treatment.  . In addition, patients should keep a diary of their symptoms so they can bring that information to office visits, he said. . “One thing I tell patients, is these are the expected side effects - if you experience these with regularity, write them down and make sure that we talk about them every time and see if they’re getting better or worse,” he said. . Lubner added that it’s important to tell doctors about side effects because they can often be managed and that sometimes just talking about them and knowing what is expected can help. . SOURCE: .

|(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday announced a cancer care initiative for Medicare beneficiaries that will link payments to oncology practices to quality of care and patient outcomes as a means of improving treatments and cutting costs. . The initiative by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Affordable Care Act, often  referred to as Obamacare, comes as expensive new cancer treatments put an increasing strain on state and federal healthcare budgets. . “We aim to provide Medicare beneficiaries struggling with cancer with high-quality care around the clock and to reward doctors for the value, not volume, of care they provide,” Dr. Patrick Conway, the chief medical officer for CMS, said in a statement. . Cancer cost the United States an estimated $263.8 billion in medical costs and lost productivity in 2010, according to the National Institutes of Health. The majority of those diagnosed are over 65 and Medicare beneficiaries, CMS said. . CMS said it has determined that a new way of paying for and delivering cancer care is needed. Called the Oncology Care Model, it would invest in physician-led practices. . The initiative aims to link payment to quality of care, find new ways to improve and coordinate care delivery, and to share cancer care information more broadly among providers, consumers, and others to support better decisions, CMS said. . It said the model would reward practices that focus on providing  services that specifically improve the patient experience and health outcomes, the agency said. . CMS hopes to broaden the initiative to include a larger portion of the population through participation of Medicaid programs and non-government payers. . Physician group practices and solo practitioners that provide chemotherapy for cancer and are enrolled in Medicare may apply to participate, CMS said. . “Other payers, including commercial insurers, Medicare Advantage plans, state programs, and Medicaid managed care plans, are also encouraged to apply,” it said. |Thu Feb 12 19:55:15 +0000 2015||U.S. initiative aims to improve cancer care, cut costs |5.659623584521421e+17|http://reut.rs/1B3cxr0
Steve Barnes|LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (Reuters) - Governor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas has signed legislation that will end by 2017 the state’s innovative but controversial adaptation of the Affordable Care Act, which has provided nearly 190,000 residents with health coverage. . Arkansas’ “private option” plan uses federal funds from the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to purchase medical insurance for some low-income individuals, rather than assigning them to the state’s Medicaid program. . The new legislation requires a task force to study state funded health care spending and find alternatives to the program. Hutchinson, a Republican, signed it late on Wednesday. . The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility to Americans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but a Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide whether to participate in the expansion. . The Arkansas approach has been used as a template in other Republican-leaning states in which President Obama and Obamacare are unpopular. .     But Democratic supporters of the option said that while an examination could prove valuable, it’s unlikely the program could be fundamentally altered without hurting the state’s budget. . That’s because the working poor insured under the program would have to be assigned to the Medicaid program at greater state expense, or again be without coverage. . “The fact is that private option is working,” said State Senate Minority Leader Keith Ingram, a Democrat. He said that Arkansas hospitals have reported a steep drop in uncompensated care since the option took effect in 2013. . Critics of the program said it had been granted only a stay of execution. . “It is financially unsustainable,” said State Senator Jim Hendren, a Republican who sponsored the bill.   .     Hutchinson, who took office last month, said ending the option this year not only would abruptly end health coverage for those enrolled, but jeopardize his proposal for a $100 million state income tax cut. . Although the private option was devised by Republican legislators working with Hutchinson’s predecessor, Democrat Mike Beebe, the plan was funded only after long and contentious debate. . Many newly elected members of the Republican-dominated state General Assembly campaigned against the plan, though a funding extension for the program through 2016 was easily approved. . Hendren agreed that an alternative to the option was “the most pressing issue.” But he warned that he and most other Republican legislators were still resolved to end the program in its current form. |Thu Feb 12 19:55:15 +0000 2015||Arkansas to end alternative Obamacare plan for poor |5.659623567156961e+17|http://reut.rs/1FDQzK6
Kathryn Doyle|Seniors admitted to the hospital intensive care unit (ICU) were more likely to die or sharply decline soon after their release depending on how well they functioned beforehand, according to a new study. . “Providers can really help categorize people . . . and give them advice on what their ICU experience might be like,” said lead author Dr. Lauren E. Ferrante of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. . “The less disabled you are, the better your outcomes are going to be,” she told Reuters Health. . Researchers looked at data on almost 300 people over age 70 who had at least one admission to an ICU in the New Haven area between 1998 and 2011. Using information from monthly interviews over the year prior to hospitalization, the study team divided the patients into three groups based on functional ability and found that these groups strongly predicted how the patients would do after the ICU. . To gauge disability level, Ferrante and her coauthors asked the patients if they needed assistance with basic life tasks, like bathing, dressing, walking, and sitting in a chair, or with things like shopping, housework, meal prep, managing finances, and if they were able to walk a quarter mile or carry a 10-pound weight.  . A person was classed as minimally disabled if he or she was able to do all or almost all of the 13 functional tasks without help. Those with mild to moderate disability needed help with about three tasks, and those with severe disability averaged only four functional activities.  . Roughly a quarter of the participants died in the ICU or within 30 days of discharge, and another quarter experienced functional decline after their hospitalization. . Based on continuing interviews, more than half of those who remained alive had become severely disabled, according to the results in JAMA Internal Medicine.  . Those who had mild to moderate disability before ICU admission were twice as likely as the minimally disabled to die within one year of ICU admission, and those with severe disability were three times as likely to die.  . Those who started out minimally disabled had much better outcomes, and should be targeted for aggressive rehabilitation since they have a good chance of recovering all of their pre-ICU function, Ferrante said. . Staying longer in the hospital and using a mechanical ventilator were also linked to a greater risk of death within one year. . “Pre ICU function had the same magnitude of effect as a mechanical ventilator,” which is surprising, and many doctors may not take baseline functional ability into account when treating patients in the ICU, Ferrante said. . “The assessment that we did is something providers can do with their patients,” Ferrante said, noting that the functional questions are easy for people to answer. . Establishing an older patient’s functional disability group will give them and their doctors a good idea of the probability of moving into another category after hospitalization, which will happen to most older people at some point, she said. . “Ideally they would have these discussions with their primary care physicians and ideally with family present, informed discussions of what might happen if they go into the ICU,” she said. “What are the benefits of aggressive care and the likelihood of various outcomes with level of pre-ICU function? Those are important things that older adults want to talk about.” . “The focus on disability is novel - most studies of ICU care just focus on survival - but older patients also care about how much help they will need in day to day tasks,” said Dr. Kenneth Covinsky, a clinician-researcher in the University of California, San Francisco division of geriatrics who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. . “This study shows that even among those who survive their care in the ICU, rates of disability are very high in the following year,” Covinsky told Reuters Health by email. . “Older patients and their families need to be prepared for the likelihood that they will be considerably more disabled after an ICU stay,” he said. “It is very likely that the amount of help needed to care for the patient will be much greater after discharge.”   . Patients, families and doctors should consider whether the person can live safely at home, and plans need to be made to provide assistance, he said. . Most adults who reach old age will experience an ICU stay, and this should be part of their advanced care planning discussion, Ferrante said.  . Other research has found that for younger people, the best way to slow or prevent functional decline is to keep physically active, she said.  . SOURCE: .  and .

Roxanne Nelson|Contrary to concerns that getting vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV) will lead young people to have more or riskier sex, a new study in England finds less risky behavior among young women who got the HPV vaccine. . “To my knowledge no studies have shown that HPV vaccination increases risky sexual behavior among young women and some of these studies have shown this (less risky behavior) is also the case outside of the UK,” said Dr. Laura Sadler of the University of Manchester, who led the study. . It’s possible that getting vaccinated led to better education about sexual health, Sadler and her colleagues write in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care.  . Sadler and other experts say it’s also possible that young women who are already less likely to take risks are the ones who are more likely to get vaccinated. . HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections and causes the majority of cervical cancers. The virus has also been linked to anal and throat cancers. Two vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, are now available that protect against strains of HPV that cause most cervical cancers.  . Even though public health officials recommend that girls and young women be vaccinated against HPV, some parents have hesitated, fearing that it could encourage sexual activity or unsafe sex. . For their study, Sadler’s team reviewed the medical records of 363 women born in 1990 or later who attended an English clinic. Almost two-thirds of the young women in the group had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Full vaccination requires three vaccine shots. . The researchers compared the womens’ histories of behaviors that are risky in themselves or tend to be linked to risky sexual behavior, such as not using condoms, having sex for the first time when they were 15 or younger, having six or more sexual partners and drinking alcohol two or more times a week. . They found five variables related to sexual behavior that were significantly different between women who had been vaccinated and those who hadn’t.  . Women who were not vaccinated were more likely to have had three sex partners in the last six months, to have attended the clinic with symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease, to have had anal intercourse with their last sexual contact and to have tested positive for Chlamydia (a common sexually transmitted infection) at their clinic visit. . Being vaccinated, in contrast, was associated with less-risky behaviors, such as using condoms. . “In this study, the lower prevalence of some risk outcomes among vaccinated women relative to unvaccinated women may be related to underlying differences in preventive care seeking and preventive health behaviors,” said Robert A. Bednarczyk, an assistant professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, and who was not involved in the study. . “The women in our study were mainly from the catch-up vaccine program - older teens - and as in the other studies, it shows that among this group, vaccination was taken up by those demonstrating other types of preventive or less risky behaviors,” Sadler told Reuters Health by email.  . While the findings are encouraging, and consistent with other research demonstrating that HPV vaccination does not lead to riskier behaviors, the study does not demonstrate that vaccination causes less risky behaviors, said Dr. Jessica Kahn, a professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. . “One explanation for the findings is that girls who are vaccinated receive education about sexual health and prevention which decreases riskier behaviors,” Kahn said in an email. . Another explanation is that girls who practice healthier and less risky behaviors are more likely to receive the vaccine, she noted. “Preventive health behaviors tend to cluster, so it makes sense that girls who practice safer behaviors are more likely to be vaccinated.” .

Alex Dobuzinskis|(Reuters) - A 7-year-old cancer survivor has made a public plea in Northern California for near-universal measles vaccinations, following a rare outbreak of the contagious disease that began in December at the Disneyland resort. . Elementary school student Rhett Krawitt spoke before the board of the Reed Union School District north of San Francisco on Tuesday night, before the panel voted 4-1 to support any statewide effort to eliminate personal belief exemptions for vaccines.  . “My name is Rhett and I give a damn,” the boy told the school board on Tuesday to audience applause, according to video footage from local television stations. . His speech brought renewed focus on the issue of personal belief exemptions for vaccinations, which has gained national attention due to an ongoing measles outbreak that began at the Disneyland resort in December. So far, more than 100 cases have been confirmed in California with over three dozen elsewhere, many of them linked to the Disneyland outbreak.  . Rhett’s father Carl Krawitt had previously called on school district officials to bar from attending his son’s school students whose parents had voluntarily exempted them from vaccinations, citing concern they could put his son at risk due to weakened immunity that left him unable to be vaccinated. . The school district superintendent said he was prohibited from taking such a step without a change in state law.  . Rhett said that he supported “making everybody get vaccinated unless they are doing chemo like I did” and that if that happens “soon we will say gone with the measles.” . The highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts, but since then the number of exposures has crept back up. . Rhett, whose immune system was previously considered too weak for inoculations because had been receiving treatment for leukemia until his recovery a year ago, may soon be vaccinated, his father said in a phone interview. . California is one of 20 states that allow parents to opt  their children out of vaccinations on the basis of their personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California lawmakers are expected to debate a bill this year to end the exemption. . All U.S. states allow exemptions for medical reasons. |Thu Feb 12 18:29:37 +0000 2015||California boy who beat leukemia urges near-universal measles jabs |5.659408075309998e+17|http://reut.rs/1FDwq6X
Sharon Bernstein|ASHLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - When Melissa Orion’s unvaccinated baby contracted whooping cough, she was grateful for modern medicine - its emergency rooms and even its antibiotics. . But the Ashland, Oregon, mom did not question her decision not to inoculate her child, and still does not, despite the  outbreak of measles in some 20 U.S. states, linked to California’s Disneyland park, that has infected more than 120 people. . “I put him on antibiotics,” the 31-year-old artist said. “But I felt the risk of vaccine was worse.”  . College-educated, middle-class and white, Orion is like many in this quaint city of 21,000 just north of the California border who have declined to vaccinate their children. . As measles cases have spread in the United States and a new outbreak of mumps has sickened at least 23 people in the northwest states of Idaho and Washington, much attention has been focused on parents who decline some or all vaccinations for their children.  . In Ashland, a quarter of kindergarteners started school last year without all their vaccinations, among the highest rates in the country. None of the community’s public schools has the 92 percent of vaccinated kindergarteners needed to provide the so-called herd immunity that protects those who are vulnerable to infection. . But persuading the community’s independent-minded, frequently affluent families to change their views is a perplexing task for public health officials, who are more used to helping the poorest and least educated parents find free or low-cost vaccinations than having to argue people out of deeply held convictions. . So some are retooling their messages, meeting with families one-on-one, and toning down sometimes strident rhetoric. . “We needed to change our tone,” said nurse Becky Sherman, project manager for the county’s Ashland Immunization Team, which was set up in 2011. . The new approach may be working. . Officials in Ashland, famous for its Shakespeare Festival,  pitched a child health website to a 12th grade or higher reading level, while noting that parents who refrain from vaccinating are doing so out of concern for their babies. . Over the past three years, the number of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated school children in Ashland has dropped from nearly 30 percent to less than 25 percent, said Samuel Bogdanove, director of student services at the Ashland Public Schools.  . The county’s child health website uses what Sherman calls respectful “Ashland-speak” to address parents. . “Whatever your current views are on vaccines and immunizations, this site is designed to serve as a resource for you,” the site says. . That is a far cry from many outreach efforts, which tend to be more strident, and not always effective.  . A study published in the journal Pediatrics last year looked at four arguments for parents who declined measles vaccinations for their kids. . The researchers shared photographs of sick children, told of an infant who almost died, distributed information about the dangers of measles and debunked a feared link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism. . None of the messages worked. And the one shooting down the autism connection backfired. . “When you challenge people’s beliefs they tend to try to defend them,” said Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, who worked on the study. “We should test the messaging we use to make sure it’s not counter-productive.”  . CENTURIES-OLD DISTRUST  . Vaccine skepticism dates back to smallpox inoculation in the late 1700s, when many feared they would instead contract the disease. Bad reactions to the polio vaccine led to its refusal by some parents in the 1950s and 1960s, and a now-discredited paper linking the measles vaccine to autism in 1998 sparked the latest round. . Other parents cite the preservative thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound found in trace amounts in some vaccines, or believe kids are healthier if their immune systems develop naturally. . While most Americans do immunize their children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 20 U.S. states allow public school students to take exemptions from vaccines based on personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . Pockets of vaccine-refusal have grown in these states, including wealthy Marin County in California’s San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Colorado.  . In Sacramento, public charter schools serving immigrants from the former Soviet Union have vaccination rates well below the 92 percent needed to keep diseases like measles at bay. At one campus run by the non-profit Gateway Community Charters, just 45 percent of kindergartners are fully immunized, data show. . “All the other kids are coughing and sneezing and mine are great,” said Inna Lastovskiy, a mother of five who fully vaccinated only her oldest child. . To better communicate with parents, Gateway hired a public health nurse, Gina Warkentin, who has been meeting with families privately. . “My intention is to educate people, not to offend anyone,” Warkentin said. Sometimes she urges them to start with a single vaccine. . Over the past two years, the number of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children in Gateway schools has dropped, said Assistant Superintendent Michael Gillespie.  . “Different parents need different types of information and they need information provided in a different way,” said Amanda Cohn, deputy director for immunization services at the CDC. . For example, she said, persuading Amish parents to vaccinate after a measles outbreak last year in Ohio required a different approach than would work with Internet-savvy parents in California. Nationwide, 92 percent of children were vaccinated against measles in 2013, up from 91 percent the prior year, the CDC said. . In Ashland, a chicken pox outbreak in December forced the cancellation of two popular holiday events and sidelined 30 students, said Jackson County public health chief Dr. James Shames.

Sharon Bernstein|ASHLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - When Melissa Orion’s unvaccinated baby contracted whooping cough, she was grateful for modern medicine - its emergency rooms and even its antibiotics. . But the Ashland, Oregon, mom did not question her decision not to inoculate her child, and still does not, despite the  outbreak of measles in some 20 U.S. states, linked to California’s Disneyland park, that has infected more than 120 people. . “I put him on antibiotics,” the 31-year-old artist said. “But I felt the risk of vaccine was worse.”  . College-educated, middle-class and white, Orion is like many in this quaint city of 21,000 just north of the California border who have declined to vaccinate their children. . As measles cases have spread in the United States and a new outbreak of mumps has sickened at least 23 people in the northwest states of Idaho and Washington, much attention has been focused on parents who decline some or all vaccinations for their children.  . In Ashland, a quarter of kindergarteners started school last year without all their vaccinations, among the highest rates in the country. None of the community’s public schools has the 92 percent of vaccinated kindergarteners needed to provide the so-called herd immunity that protects those who are vulnerable to infection. . But persuading the community’s independent-minded, frequently affluent families to change their views is a perplexing task for public health officials, who are more used to helping the poorest and least educated parents find free or low-cost vaccinations than having to argue people out of deeply held convictions. . So some are retooling their messages, meeting with families one-on-one, and toning down sometimes strident rhetoric. . “We needed to change our tone,” said nurse Becky Sherman, project manager for the county’s Ashland Immunization Team, which was set up in 2011. . The new approach may be working. . Officials in Ashland, famous for its Shakespeare Festival,  pitched a child health website to a 12th grade or higher reading level, while noting that parents who refrain from vaccinating are doing so out of concern for their babies. . Over the past three years, the number of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated school children in Ashland has dropped from nearly 30 percent to less than 25 percent, said Samuel Bogdanove, director of student services at the Ashland Public Schools.  . The county’s child health website uses what Sherman calls respectful “Ashland-speak” to address parents. . “Whatever your current views are on vaccines and immunizations, this site is designed to serve as a resource for you,” the site says. . That is a far cry from many outreach efforts, which tend to be more strident, and not always effective.  . A study published in the journal Pediatrics last year looked at four arguments for parents who declined measles vaccinations for their kids. . The researchers shared photographs of sick children, told of an infant who almost died, distributed information about the dangers of measles and debunked a feared link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism. . None of the messages worked. And the one shooting down the autism connection backfired. . “When you challenge people’s beliefs they tend to try to defend them,” said Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, who worked on the study. “We should test the messaging we use to make sure it’s not counter-productive.”  . CENTURIES-OLD DISTRUST  . Vaccine skepticism dates back to smallpox inoculation in the late 1700s, when many feared they would instead contract the disease. Bad reactions to the polio vaccine led to its refusal by some parents in the 1950s and 1960s, and a now-discredited paper linking the measles vaccine to autism in 1998 sparked the latest round. . Other parents cite the preservative thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound found in trace amounts in some vaccines, or believe kids are healthier if their immune systems develop naturally. . While most Americans do immunize their children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 20 U.S. states allow public school students to take exemptions from vaccines based on personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . Pockets of vaccine-refusal have grown in these states, including wealthy Marin County in California’s San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Colorado.  . In Sacramento, public charter schools serving immigrants from the former Soviet Union have vaccination rates well below the 92 percent needed to keep diseases like measles at bay. At one campus run by the non-profit Gateway Community Charters, just 45 percent of kindergartners are fully immunized, data show. . “All the other kids are coughing and sneezing and mine are great,” said Inna Lastovskiy, a mother of five who fully vaccinated only her oldest child. . To better communicate with parents, Gateway hired a public health nurse, Gina Warkentin, who has been meeting with families privately. . “My intention is to educate people, not to offend anyone,” Warkentin said. Sometimes she urges them to start with a single vaccine. . Over the past two years, the number of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children in Gateway schools has dropped, said Assistant Superintendent Michael Gillespie.  . “Different parents need different types of information and they need information provided in a different way,” said Amanda Cohn, deputy director for immunization services at the CDC. . For example, she said, persuading Amish parents to vaccinate after a measles outbreak last year in Ohio required a different approach than would work with Internet-savvy parents in California. Nationwide, 92 percent of children were vaccinated against measles in 2013, up from 91 percent the prior year, the CDC said. . In Ashland, a chicken pox outbreak in December forced the cancellation of two popular holiday events and sidelined 30 students, said Jackson County public health chief Dr. James Shames. Afterward, some parents rushed to have their children vaccinated, Shames said. . But not Hannah Wirth, 34. “It scares me,” Wirth said. “The mercury and other chemicals in vaccines don’t seem natural to put in the body.”|Thu Feb 12 17:40:11 +0000 2015||Softer, less strident outreach may help calm U.S. vaccine skeptics |5.659283644612895e+17|http://reut.rs/1FDk3YL
|ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast launched enrollment for a planned universal healthcare program on Thursday with initial government financing of 20 billion CFA francs ($34.67 million), the scheme’s director said.  . The West African nation is expecting 4 million people to sign up this year, in a country where officials say less than five percent of the population is covered by health insurance. . The insurance will eventually be compulsory for the country’s 23 million inhabitants, requiring a monthly contribution of 1,000 CFA francs for every person over the age of five years.  . Low-cost treatment of basic health problems is due to begin in September before expanding next year. . “Universal health coverage is a need. It’s a necessity. We must create a foundation of solidarity,” Karim Bamba, the general director of the National Health Insurance Fund said at the program’s launch. |Thu Feb 12 17:39:59 +0000 2015||Ivory Coast launches enrollment for universal healthcare scheme |5.6592831577798656e+17|http://reut.rs/1B2JaVY
Misha Hussain|CONAKRY (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - International donors wishing to help Guinea fight Ebola should use their money to strengthen the West African country’s health system and help it tackle future epidemics instead of building more Ebola treatment centers, a government official said. . The worst ever outbreak of Ebola has killed at least 9,177 people out of 22,894 recorded cases, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have some of the weakest healthcare and disease surveillance systems in the world. . The World Health Organization said on Wednesday the number of new Ebola cases rose for the second week in a row in West Africa, nearly doubling in Guinea, suggesting declines earlier this year had stalled. . “We already have over 400 beds (in Ebola treatment centers), but the attendance is among the lowest of the epidemic, so let’s leave it at that,” government spokesman Fode Tass Sylla told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Conakry. . “Help us strengthen the health system, because after Ebola, all these treatment centers will disappear and Guinea will still be too weak to deal with the next epidemic,” Sylla said, adding that the government was in talks with all funding partners. . Guinea will need an estimated $296 million to eliminate Ebola and an additional $642 million to improve its health system to prevent future epidemics, according to a national action plan to combat the deadly virus. . Guinea has only 3,435 hospital beds for a population of nearly 11.5 million and only one doctor for every 100,000 people, according to an Oxfam report in November. . In the country where West Africa’s Ebola outbreak began, it can take aid workers up to six hours to move patients from remote villages to treatment centers over treacherous roads. . “We have to strengthen hospital and health posts in rural areas by training staff and stocking medicines and equipment. We need to reinforce the sanitary service and make sure messages on TV and radio reach the remotest communities,” Sylla said. . The latest treatment center, a 50-bed facility funded by the French government in Beyla, southeast Guinea, was completed in January when cases appeared to be declining. Guinea has asked for its operating costs to be reallocated, aid sources say. . “Donors are not flexible or quick enough to react to the fast-changing dynamics of this Ebola outbreak. They’ve allocated money for a purpose, and the money has to be spent no matter what,” said the head of a major medical charity, who declined to be identified. . “When planning an Ebola treatment center, donors have to budget for the center to run at full capacity for at least 6 months, so if it’s empty, there’s money left over from what would have been used for the day-to-day running of the center,” the aid worker said. |Thu Feb 12 16:43:56 +0000 2015||Ebola-hit Guinea asks for funds for creaking health sector |5.659142108075991e+17|http://reut.rs/1B2wKxk
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) – Women caring for partners with traumatic brain injury (TBI) experience enough grief and stress to put their own health at risk, according to a small study of U.S. veterans’ wives and girlfriends. . Anger, blame and grief for the loss of the man they once knew were linked to elevated inflammation levels that raise the women’s risk for chronic disease, researchers say, and not being able to turn to their loved one for support only makes things worse. . “You think about your spouse or significant other and that is such a meaningful relationship and usually the person you go to when you are under stress,” said Karen Saban, of the Loyola University Chicago Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, who led the study. “Here they are going through this very stressful situation but they’ve kind of lost their main person to get support from.” . Saban, who is also a research health scientist at the Edward Hines Jr. Veteran’s Administration Hospital in Hines, Illinois, noted that the women could be finding it particularly difficult to cope because they are relatively young, still working and raising children.  . Past research shows a link between grief and physical health problems like high blood pressure and coronary artery disease, Saban and her colleagues write in Biological Research for Nursing. Chronic stress and depression also puts caregivers at increased risk of inflammation-related illnesses, they note. . Since the year 2000, Saban’s team writes, 244,217 veterans have been diagnosed with the TBI, considered moderate or severe in 43,000 of those cases. The injury can cause seizures, lack of coordination, weakness and cognitive problems. . Researchers analyzed data on 40 women recruited for a larger national study on caregivers from a Veterans Administration trauma clinic, social networking sites and by sending letters to veterans’ homes. . The women, caring for a husband or domestic partner who had TBI within the previous 10 years, answered questions about their levels of grief, stress and depression. They also gave saliva samples, which were used to measure tumor necrosis factor, a protein that signals stress and immune responses. . Based on the womens’ responses, Saban’s team found that the caregivers felt 35 percent more anger than is typical among women not caring for TBI victims, and also had 25 percent more tumor necrosis factor than average. . The women caregivers felt the same type of grief experienced by people whose loved ones have died, but it was their levels of anger and blame – which are a part of grief – that were key to the higher levels of inflammation-promoting tumor necrosis factor, according to the results. . “Some anger is probably very normal for caregivers, but I think it’s a difficult emotion to express and, in particular, these caregivers of vets who had a war injury may feel even more guilty,” Saban told Reuters Health. “That feeling may be inducing some of these chemical changes that may set them up for chronic inflammation and possibly chronic disease in the future.” . Rebecca Utz, a sociologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, said the study offered several important reminders about the complexities of grief, loss and the physiological responses they can cause.   . “A person does not have to die to experience a loss,” said Utz, who was not involved in the study. “TBI represents a major redefinition of the person’s identity, functioning and relationship to others. This redefinition is the loss that caregivers are experiencing,” she said. . The study demonstrates that caregivers may be at increased risk for mental health issues and inflammation-related illnesses, Utz added.   . “Their stress has real physical health outcomes, which may alter or reduce their ability to provide caregiving. This has implications on the longevity and staying-power of caregivers, especially those that are expected to provide long duration of caregiving,” she said. . Utz noted that the study should have better explained the blame and anger that the women felt and how it was associated with grief, mental health problems and inflammatory responses. . Saban said therapy could offer caregivers both social support and coping mechanisms. . “Getting beyond feeling the stress and burden, there are ways that perhaps people can reframe how they’re looking at the situation over time . . . saying, ‘I am really making a difference in this person’s life,’” Saban said. .

|LONDON (Reuters) - Two British military healthcare workers who were flown home after their possible exposure to the Ebola virus have been discharged from hospital, government agency Public Health England said on Thursday. . The Royal Free Hospital in London admitted the two workers on Jan. 31 and Feb. 2 after they had received needle injuries in two separate incidents in Sierra Leone, where they were helping to combat the Ebola epidemic. . Public Health England said neither had shown any symptoms of the virus. . “The individuals will receive ongoing monitoring and support while residing in appropriate private accommodation close to the Royal Free. The risk to the public from Ebola remains very low,” the agency said in a statement.  . The worst Ebola epidemic in history broke out in late 2013 in West Africa, where it has killed close to 10,000 people. The spread of the virus began to slow late last year, but the World Heath Organization warned against complacency this week after a recent spike in new cases. |Thu Feb 12 16:01:09 +0000 2015||UK military health workers tested for Ebola discharged from hospital |5.659034429512991e+17|http://reut.rs/1B2m0iw

Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Novavax Inc has begun early-stage human trials of an Ebola vaccine that it hopes can win the race to become the most effective shot for the deadly virus. . The company has the means to manufacture millions of doses of the vaccine every month and is seeking funding to develop it further, Chief Executive Stanley Erck told Reuters. . The worst outbreak of Ebola on record has killed more than 9,000 people. After infection rates showed signs of stalling, the number of new cases has risen again in the last two weeks. . Even as President Barack Obama withdraws most U.S. troops fighting the epidemic in West Africa, drug developers are pursuing ways to prevent and limit any future outbreak. . For an Ebola vaccine to be viable, researchers say it must be cheap, easy to produce and capable of being handled and transported to Africa. The future lies in the shot’s ability to hit multiple strains as the virus evolves. . Novavax is testing its Ebola GP Vaccine in 230 healthy volunteers in Australia. Each subject, aged between 18 and 50, will receive two intramuscular injections 21 days apart. Results are expected by the end of the second quarter, Erck said. . Early human data on a vaccine being developed by GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the most advanced to date, has suggested a single dose may not provoke an immune response strong enough to protect those exposed to Ebola. . Other drugmakers are collaborating to develop vaccines: NewLink Genetics Corp with Merck & Co Inc and Johnson & Johnson with Bavarian Nordic A/S. . J&J says its vaccine can be stored at normal refrigerator temperature for weeks on end, giving it an advantage over test shots that are typically kept at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius. . Erck said Novavax’s vaccine, which requires smaller doses than others in development, can also be stored at refrigerator temperatures and has the potential to hit multiple strains of Ebola. . The company said its human trial is backed by data showing that every animal vaccinated was protected from a lethal dose of the virus. . Shares of Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Novavax have risen more than 60 percent since Oct. 27, when the company revealed it was testing its vaccine in non-human primates. . They were up 1.9 percent at $8.40 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. |Thu Feb 12 13:48:08 +0000 2015||Novavax starts Ebola vaccine trial in humans |5.6586996871020134e+17|http://reut.rs/1B1Tz41
|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Red Cross teams in Ebola-hit Guinea have been attacked on average 10 times a month over the past year, the charity said on Thursday, warning that the violence was hampering efforts to contain the disease. . In the most recent incident last Sunday in the town of Forecariah about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Conakry, two Red Cross volunteers were beaten while trying to conduct a safe burial, the charity said. . Ending traditional burials is seen as crucial to stopping the spread of the latest outbreak, which has killed more than 9,100 people, mainly in West Africa, because rituals often involve extensive contact with highly contagious corpses. . “As long as people have misconceptions about how Ebola is spread, and continue to prevent volunteers from doing their work, we will not stop the disease,” said Youssouf Traore, president of the Red Cross Society of Guinea. . The number of new cases in Guinea nearly doubled last week to 64, the World Health Organization said, jeopardizing a government plan to get to zero new cases by early March. . Officials say that locals especially around the capital Conakry continued to hide sick friends and relatives from authorities.  . Traore said he thought hostility towards the charity was due to rumors that it had been disinfecting schools and vaccinating children, amid fears this was part of a plot to infect locals with the virus. . President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he was bringing back nearly all U.S. troops fighting the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and marking a new phase in the battle to help countries “get to zero” cases. Guinea has the longest way to go in ending the outbreak, he added. |Thu Feb 12 12:42:46 +0000 2015||Red Cross Ebola teams in Guinea attacked 10 times a month |5.6585351927905894e+17|http://reut.rs/1FCdIg8
|(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, GNC Holdings Inc and Target Corp agreed to remove certain dietary supplements off their shelves in New York after receiving a threat of legal action from the state’s attorney general, the New York Times reported. . The retailers received subpoenas from New York State attorney general Eric Schneiderman on Wednesday, demanding evidence for the health claims printed on labels of dietary supplements sold in New York, the newspaper said. . Last week, Schneiderman asked major retailers to halt sales of certain herbal supplements as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials listed on majority of products tested. (. ) . Earlier this week, GNC said it refuted the claims made by Schneiderman in his Feb. 2 letter and said retesting results clearly and conclusively demonstrate that the company’s products are pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements. . The subpoenas require the retailers to provide evidence of how they would prove the authenticity of their product claims, the newspaper said, citing a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation who is not authorized to discuss the case. (. )     . Representatives at Schneiderman’s office, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, GNC and Target were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. |Thu Feb 12 10:23:22 +0000 2015||Four retailers pull some dietary aids off shelves after probe: NYT |5.6581843560380826e+17|http://reut.rs/1FBOYEK
Robin Respaut|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of commuters on San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit system may have been exposed to measles after an infectious Bay Area resident rode a train to and from work for three days last week, public health officials said on Wednesday. . The rider represents the first case of measles confirmed by Contra Costa County health officials during an outbreak of the disease that began in late December. The infected person also spent time at a San Francisco restaurant and bar on the evening of Feb. 4. . “Although the risk of contracting measles by being exposed on BART is low, Bay Area residents should be aware of the situation,” the county public health department said in a statement. . The California Department of Public Health said on Wednesday that 110 cases of measles had been confirmed in California, many of them linked to the outbreak that authorities believe began when an infected person from out of the country visited Disneyland in late December. . More than three dozen more cases have been documented in other U.S. states and in Mexico. Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.  . In the Bay Area case, the infected person was known to have traveled between the Lafayette station in the East Bay and the Montgomery station in San Francisco during the morning and evening rush-hour commutes on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week, BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost said.  . That ride is 35 minutes long, but health officials said the highly infectious, airborne virus could have remained in the air for up to two hours. Because BART cars circulate throughout the Bay area, tens of thousands of people could have potentially been exposed, Trost said. . The infected rider, who was not identified by name, age or gender, also spent time at the E&O Kitchen and Bar in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, potentially exposing others who were in the restaurant between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., health officials said.  . Public health officials said they were tracing the movements of the person, who is recovering and not hospitalized, and notifying others known to have had close contact.  . Authorities sought to downplay the risk to commuters or diners, however, saying that most people had been inoculated for the disease, but urged anyone who had not to get vaccinated. . “We do know that measles has been circulating through the Bay Area. This person doesn’t know where they were exposed,” said Erika Jenssen, Contra Costa County’s communicable disease programs chief. . Among the more than three dozen cases reported outside of California are 10 in Cook County, Illinois, nine of them associated with a daycare center in the city of Palatine. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of measles cases in 20 years. |Thu Feb 12 01:25:34 +0000 2015||San Francisco commuters possibly exposed to measles on train |5.656830963692544e+17|http://reut.rs/1FAoMu1
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A 53-year-old California woman suffering from leukemia sued the state’s attorney general and San Francisco’s top prosecutor on Wednesday seeking the right for physicians to aid the terminally ill in taking their own lives. . The lawsuit asks San Francisco Superior Court to “clarify” that a California law making it illegal to aid, advise or encourage someone to commit suicide does not apply to doctors assisting a dying, mentally competent patient. . “I am suing the State of California to remove the legal barrier between my doctor and myself to help me achieve a peaceful and dignified death, at the time and place of my choosing,” lead plaintiff Christine White said in a written statement released with the lawsuit. . White has battled aggressive cancer for seven years, first non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and then leukemia, which is currently in remission.  . The lawsuit was filed on her behalf by attorneys for the Disability Rights Legal Center. Also named as plaintiffs were five San Francisco doctors who support physician-assisted suicide. . “If and when the leukemia returns, I want to have the option to ask my doctor to aid me in my dying,” she said. “I don’t want to die in a hospital, I’ve seen too many of my friends in the cancer patients’ community die that way.” . The lawsuit comes four months after Brittany Maynard, suffering from a gliobastoma brain tumor, moved from San Francisco to Oregon to take advantage of that state’s Death With Dignity Act, which allows terminally ill residents to end their lives with the assistance of a physician. . Maynard, 29, took her own life in early November.   . Two California state senators last month introduced legislation supported by Maynard’s family that would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medications to terminally ill patients, but the bill’s chances for passage are uncertain.   . “I do not want to have to leave my husband, my family and my friends and move to Oregon, where terminal patients have some measure of peace of mind, dignity and control over their dying,” White said in her statement. . A spokesman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who has announced that she would seek the Democratic nomination to replace retiring U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. . Representatives for San Francisco County District Attorney George Gascon could not be reached for comment on Wednesday afternoon. |Wed Feb 11 23:46:45 +0000 2015||California cancer patient sues for right to doctor-assisted death |5.656582254173921e+17|http://reut.rs/1FAcCkP
Gene Emery|A new study suggests that smoking may be responsible for 60,000 to 120,000 more deaths in the U.S. each year than previously thought. . The examination of 181,377 fatalities logged in five large databases found that many of the excess deaths among smokers were due to causes not previously linked to smoking, such as kidney failure, infections and possibly breast and prostate cancers. . Until now, 21 common diseases have been associated with cigarette smoking, including diabetes, 12 cancers and six forms of cardiovascular disease. The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, may expand that list. . “We were interested in whether smoking causes more than these diseases that are on the list. And we certainly did find some,” coauthor Eric Jacobs told Reuters Health. “The fact that about 17 percent of the extra deaths that occur in smokers were due to causes that were not on the Surgeon General’s list was a bit of a surprise to me.” . If the findings are applied nationwide, he said, the number of previously-unrecognized smoking-related deaths could be greater than the total number of Americans who die each year of influenza or liver disease. . Until this study, about 480,000 U.S. deaths each year were believed to be attributable to cigarettes. . The researchers also found that the elevated risks faded as smokers stayed off cigarettes.  . The findings derive from databases following nearly a million people over age 54 for about a decade. . The researchers expected to see smokers dying faster than nonsmokers, and they did.  . But when they looked beyond conventional causes, they found that smoking doubled the risk of death from kidney failure and from various respiratory diseases. It also seemed to pose a six-fold risk of death from intestinal ischemia, where the intestine is damaged by reduced blood flow.  . The risk of death from infections was 2.3 times higher and the likelihood of death from cirrhosis of the liver was 3.1 times higher. . Breast cancer deaths were 30 percent higher among the smokers. Prostate cancer death rates were elevated by 40 percent. . In many cases, the more people smoked, the greater the risk. That wasn’t seen in prostate cancer, “but the risk of death decreased significantly as the number of years since quitting smoking increased,” said Dr. Graham Colditz of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, in an editorial. . “It’s not a surprise that smoking kills. We’ve known that for years,” said Jacobs, who is director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. “But it’s important for people to realize the full impact that smoking has in terms of the national deaths. So eliminating smoking needs to be a national priority.” . In his editorial, Colditz points out that 18 percent of the U.S. population, 42 million Americans, smoke, and public health efforts to help them quit have not done enough to change “social norms.” . In the U.S., smoking has become a habit of the poor and the poorly-educated, Colditz told Reuters Health. He said that “in 2013, a total of 29 percent of adults below the poverty line smoked, whereas 16 percent at or above the poverty level did. In addition, only 6 percent of adults with advanced college degrees smoked, whereas 41 percent of those with a general equivalency degree did.” . Colditz writes in the editorial, “The Affordable Care Act provides expanded access to cessation support for many, but holes in Medicaid coverage in many states leave numerous smokers without as much evidence-based support as they need.”  .

Randi Belisomo|The duty to guide patients through the end-of-life decision-making process rests squarely upon primary care providers, writes one internist in The New England Journal of Medicine, maintaining that her colleagues should better support seriously ill patients earlier and throughout the course of disease.   . Susan Tolle, director of the Center for Ethics in Health Care at the Oregon Health and Science University, is one of three physicians responding to the NEJM’s most recent “Clinical Decisions” case feature, detailing a woman undergoing treatment for metastatic breast cancer. However, her advance directive has not been reviewed in close to a decade.  . The two other physicians who responded with their opinions – Dr. Anthony L. Back from the University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Dr. Diane E. Meier from the Center to Advance Palliative Care at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City - claim an oncologist or palliative specialist should initiate the conversation about the patient’s goals. But Tolle says it is the primary care physician’s obligation to lead this difficult discussion and myriad others nationwide.  . “Primary care has to get a sense that it should own this, and we should be providing this continuity of support,” she said.  . Tolle developed the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) paradigm, designed to turn treatment wishes of seriously ill patients into actionable medical orders. While having a POLST form filled out is strongly associated with receiving desired levels of treatment, Tolle maintains that without widespread intervention of primary providers, patients will be less likely to ensure their end of life wishes are honored.  . NEJM editors say they selected this case as part of a larger dialogue about end of life care, now reaching from hospital hallways to American living rooms as the PBS Frontline documentary, “Being Mortal,” which debuted Tuesday. The report is based on Dr. Atul Gawande’s best-selling book about the need for doctors to talk with patients about death.  . “We’re trying to engender discussion,” said Jonathan Adler, NEJM clinical strategy editor and Massachusetts General Hospital emergency physician. “Not infrequently do I see patients for whom this discussion should have taken place but didn’t, and  something catastrophic happens. People are rushing to make these decisions and different family members with different perspectives are talking about what they think the patient’s wishes were.”  . Tolle points out that dialogue regarding goals of care earlier in an illness impacts patient satisfaction and choices. According to the Institute of Medicine’s recent Dying in America report, more than a quarter of adults have given little or no thought to end of life wishes. Fewer have communicated wishes in writing or through conversation. These statistics are ones that Tolle encourages her primary care colleagues to work to reverse. . Leaders within the American College of Physicians, an organization representing internists, agree. “Somebody has to step up,” said Robert Centor, Chair of the ACP Board of Regents. “If you’re a primary care physician, it’s incumbent on you to have the discussion with patients before and especially after they get sick about goals. If we don’t know a patient’s goals, they can’t get the best possible care.” . End of life planning, however, is not a billable Medicare service, and often takes much of what Centor calls the primary care physician’s most important commodity: time. “The system discourages us from spending enough time,” he said. “But we have a moral and ethical responsibility to give patients the time they deserve.”  . Tolle applauds insurance programs that task nurse case managers with calling seriously ill policy holders to help decision-making. In place for close to a decade, Aetna’s Compassionate Care Program has resulted in an 86 percent reduction of patient days in intensive care.  . “In the current state of medical practice, we are not seeing this type of engagement offered to people with advanced illness,” said Randall Krakauer, Aetna’s director for medical strategy. “They are not getting the advice, assistance and support that we think is most appropriate.”  . Certainly, Krakauer acknowledged, the program has had huge cost-savings; however, he said, finances did not drive its implementation. “We were not at all clear when we began that it was going to save money,” he said.  . Tolle said Aetna and other insurers are performing a service that should be done and hopes will be more routinely provided by primary physicians.”We should be able to offer more coordinated care from inside the health system than from the outside.”  .

Janice Neumann|A year after being hospitalized, seniors who enjoyed the arts were only about half as likely to attend concerts, films or art exhibits as they had been 10 years earlier, a new study from Ireland finds. . The drop-off in seniors’ art interest during and after hospitalization could be partly explained by age, illness and, in some cases, depression. But researchers said the lack of access to engaging art and culture in the hospital could also be a factor.   . “Offering arts interventions and opportunities in hospital is important in keeping people interested and engaged in the arts and indeed avoiding institutionalization,” said Hilary Moss, who led the study.   . “It is also important for the person’s sense of being an individual with personal preferences that hospital aesthetics are attended to and that people have control over their aesthetic environment in the hospital whenever possible,” said Moss, director of arts and health at Tallaght Hospital in Dublin. . For the purposes of the study, which is published in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, “aesthetics” referred to so-called receptive arts, such as reading, watching movies or listening to the radio, and participative arts, such as playing a musical instrument, painting or doing crafts.   . The researchers surveyed 150 people aged 65 to 94 (most older than 75) who were in outpatient clinics between January and September 2013, having been hospitalized from January 2009 to July 2013. . The seniors were asked which arts events and activities they had participated in during the year after hospitalization and 10 years prior. Questions included how much difficulty they had attending arts events and activities after hospitalization and what made attendance a challenge. . Many cited health issues, lack of transportation and less motivation or self-esteem as obstacles to enjoying arts as much as they had in the past.  . The participants were also asked their opinions about the noise, access to arts activities and visual arts in the hospital.  . Less than half said they were able to watch favorite television programs or listen to music they liked, and a little over half listened to radio programs of their choice while in the hospital.    . They also tended to recall being distracted by sounds from patients or staff. Most had no choice of private room or access to a quiet place to read or listen to the radio, they said. . Watching films was the most popular art event before hospitalization, though only 29 percent of the adults watched films of their choice while in the hospital.     . Before hospitalization 47 percent attended films, 37 percent musicals and 42 percent plays. But those numbers dropped in the year afterwards, with 21 percent saying they watched films, 14 percent watching plays and musicals and 13 percent attending classical music events. . Music, dancing and photography were the most popular participative arts and seniors also tended to enjoy going to arts classes, but participation dropped off dramatically compared with 10 years earlier.  . For example, 10 years prior to hospitalization, 23 percent of participants had done some kind of dancing that was not a fitness class, 19 percent played a musical instrument, 11 percent sang in front of an audience and 19 percent did painting, drawing or sculpture. One year after hospitalization, 5 percent were dancing, less than 5 percent were playing an instrument, 3 percent were singing and 12 percent were painting, drawing or sculpting. . Moss told Reuters Health by email that she was surprised many patients did not show more interest in the arts when they were ill. As a music therapist and musician, she said she had seen people who were acutely depressed or schizophrenic benefit from being in a singing group, which “provided positive, hopeful activity at a time of crisis.”   . Jackie Hamilton, director of UK Arts in HealthCare (part of the University of Kentucky’s  health care system) in Lexington, said “. . . art, music and narrative interventions definitely make any patient feel more human and more in control.” . Hamilton said that even patients with debilitating illnesses like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s benefit from music and interactive art activities. “A light-filled, quiet and aesthetic environment improve recovery, mood and stress levels for patients of all ages,” she added.  . Moss said hospitals might help seniors by providing access to film screenings and dance activities, as well as quiet places where people could listen to music they liked.   . “It is important that older people in the hospital are involved in the arts that they enjoy, whatever they are . . . where people can no longer dance, I find anecdotally that they enjoy discussing dance, watching dance and seeing performances, although of course sometimes this creates sadness in no longer being able to participate,” Moss said. .

Alex Dobuzinskis|(Reuters) - A 7-year-old cancer survivor has made a public plea in Northern California for near-universal measles vaccinations, following a rare outbreak of the contagious disease that began in December at the Disneyland resort. . Elementary school student Rhett Krawitt spoke before the board of the Reed Union School District north of San Francisco on Tuesday night, before the panel voted 4-1 to support any statewide effort to eliminate personal belief exemptions for vaccines.  . “My name is Rhett and I give a damn,” the boy told the school board on Tuesday to audience applause, according to video footage from local television stations. . His speech brought renewed focus on the issue of personal belief exemptions for vaccinations, which has gained national attention due to an ongoing measles outbreak that began at the Disneyland resort in December. So far, more than 100 cases have been confirmed in California with over three dozen elsewhere, many of them linked to the Disneyland outbreak.  . Rhett’s father Carl Krawitt had previously called on school district officials to bar from attending his son’s school students whose parents had voluntarily exempted them from vaccinations, citing concern they could put his son at risk due to weakened immunity that left him unable to be vaccinated. . The school district superintendent said he was prohibited from taking such a step without a change in state law.  . Rhett said that he supported “making everybody get vaccinated unless they are doing chemo like I did” and that if that happens “soon we will say gone with the measles.” . The highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts, but since then the number of exposures has crept back up. . Rhett, whose immune system was previously considered too weak for inoculations because had been receiving treatment for leukemia until his recovery a year ago, may soon be vaccinated, his father said in a phone interview. . California is one of 20 states that allow parents to opt  their children out of vaccinations on the basis of their personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California lawmakers are expected to debate a bill this year to end the exemption. . All U.S. states allow exemptions for medical reasons. |Wed Feb 11 22:21:01 +0000 2015||California boy who beat leukemia urges near-universal measles jabs |5.656366531640361e+17|http://reut.rs/1FzX1le
Aditya Kalra|NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two state-of-the-art public hospitals in New Delhi are barely operational years after they officially opened - not for lack of funding but because officials did not spend the millions of dollars allocated to treat heart and kidney patients. . The empty hospitals in the heart of the Indian capital are emblematic of the paralysis gripping a public health system  that is responsible for some of the world’s worst health indicators. Many of the country’s 1.2 billion people have a choice between expensive private care, or no care at all. . Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces many challenges to his stated goal of providing universal public health coverage, but one of the most daunting is ending the logjams that mean officials consistently fail to use their budgets. . At the 300-bed Janakpuri Super Speciality Hospital, gleaming marble-floored corridors disappear into dark wings, thick chains locking the doors to most of the five-storey building. Wards lie empty, without beds. It officially opened in 2008. . In another part of the city of 16 million people, the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital sits in a landscaped 13-acre complex. It started outpatient services in 2003 but more than a decade later only six beds - of the 650 the hospital was built for - receive overnight patients. . The hospitals were allocated $48 million in the current financial year but still lack basic equipment and, crucially, doctors. They will only spend a fraction of the amount by year-end: under 20 percent in the case of Janakpuri hospital. . A Reuters investigation found no evidence that corruption was responsible for the situation. Instead, officials and health experts blamed a tortuous procurement process, political wrangling and bureaucratic incompetence.  . Janakpuri hospital Director M.M. Mehndiratta said he waited 15 months for approval to hire more doctors, with the request traveling to Delhi’s top health officials before getting stuck for months in the administrative and finance departments. . “There have been times when I have felt like going to my old job or shifting to the private sector,” Mehndiratta said with a laugh. He was earlier a doctor at the G.B. Pant Hospital, one of the biggest in Delhi. . India records the world’s highest number of deaths during pregnancy and high rates of child mortality from diarrhea, pneumonia and measles. Inadequate health infrastructure and a  scarcity of doctors mean people in small towns and villages end up traveling long distances to get basic care. . India has 0.7 hospital beds per 1,000 people, less than a third of the global average of 2.7 beds, a World Health Organization (WHO) report said last year. There is one doctor for every 1,400 people, lower than neighboring Pakistan. . India’s health system will need to add 3.6 million hospital beds, 3 million doctors and 6 million nurses over the next 20 years to meet the needs of the growing population, consultants PwC India estimate. . “We buy an X-ray machine, but there is no X-ray operator,” Health Minister J.P. Nadda said while discussing general health funding with reporters last month. “Money is not the major factor, it is (the lack of) optimal utilization.” . Data compiled by Reuters in collaboration with the Public Health Foundation of India shows the underutilization is a national problem. Even though India revised down its federal health budget mid-year in all but one year since 2005, the country only once managed to spend all the funds.  . India spends a tiny 1 percent of gross domestic product on public health, less than Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. Federal budget cuts exceeded 15 percent in the last three years, partly because India tightened the purse strings to meet challenging fiscal deficit goals. . A senior health official in New Delhi blamed delays such as those plaguing Rajiv Gandhi and Janakpuri hospitals on the incompetence of government employees and a “lethargic and slow” process of selecting vendors. Fearing corruption charges, officials work in an environment of “procurement phobia”. . “We need clearances from about 10 agencies before laying even a brick,” said the official, who asked not to be named.  . Delhi’s local government also spent years debating whether the vacant multi-speciality hospitals should be run in partnership with the private sector. . “Finally the government thought, since we have invested money, we will run it,” the government official said. . Since the Delhi government began building the Rajiv Gandhi and Janakpuri hospitals in 1998, dozens of private hospitals have sprung up to meet the city’s growing medical needs.  . Industry body ASSOCHAM estimated in 2013 that India’s private hospital sector would grow at 20 percent annually and become a $125 billion market by 2017.  . The private sector now accounts for 80 percent of India’s healthcare delivery market. . Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd., India’s largest listed hospital chain by revenue, classifies inadequate public spending as one of its growth drivers. According to Thomson Reuters data, Apollo and rival Fortis Healthcare Ltd have registered annual revenue growth in excess of 15 percent for the last five years. |Wed Feb 11 22:05:12 +0000 2015||Deserted New Delhi hospitals sour India's healthcare dream |5.6563267070593434e+17|http://reut.rs/1FzU4Bg
Kathryn Doyle|Women who take the acne drug isotretinoin (Accutane) must pledge to prevent pregnancy but often they lack thorough, accurate information about birth control methods, according to a new study. . For many young women with severe acne, this is their first real exposure to birth control education, and they aren’t getting the information they need, said senior study author Dr. Eleanor B. Schwarz of the University of California, Davis. . The drug is powerful, experts said, and better contraceptive counseling would make it available to more people who need it. . Four to five months taking prescription isotretinoin usually clears even severe acne that has not responded to other treatment. The drug can cause severe fetal brain, heart and face deformities when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy, however.  . Between 1992 and 2003, more than 2,000 women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin, almost all ending in abortion or miscarriage. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration introduced the iPledge program in 2005, requiring prescribers to register, and female patients of childbearing age to qualify by pledging to use two forms of birth control and take doctor-administered pregnancy tests for two consecutive months. . With two negative pregnancy tests and a completed online comprehension test, the patient will be authorized to pick up her prescription, and has to return to the doctor for pregnancy tests every 30 days while taking the medication. . Schwarz and her team surveyed 100 women of childbearing age visiting a dermatologist’s office about their knowledge of eight contraceptive methods, asking them to rank the methods’ effectiveness. . Then the women reviewed an information sheet about the contraceptive methods that the researchers had specially designed, and retook the effectiveness survey. . More than half of the women surveyed said they had seen a physician for acne problems in the past year, and 11 women said they had ever used isotretinoin.  . Before viewing the information sheet, most women overestimated the effectiveness of birth control pills, injections and condoms. A third had never heard of contraceptive implants and 16 percent had not heard of intrauterine devices, which are by far the two most effective options, Schwarz noted. . On average, the women spent less than one minute looking at the information sheet, but the number who answered effectiveness questions correctly increased on almost every measure for the second survey. . Among the participants who had used isotrentinoin, five said the most effective contraceptive method they used while on the drug was the Pill, two said it was the IUD, three said “None” and three did not answer the question. . The information currently provided in the 20-page iPledge packet is out of date, and includes abstinence in its list of contraception options, Schwarz told Reuters Health by phone.   . As she and her team developed the information sheet in Pittsburgh, they saw that abstinence was among the most common methods people would use. . “If you forget that you are using abstinence, that’s out the door,” she said.  . Schwarz would like to see the iPledge material updated. . “The thing that doesn’t really make any sense is there’s only some methods that you can use in combination, you can’t have two IUDs,” Schwarz said. “And there’s no evidence that doubling up on condom and diaphragm is more effective.” . Most contraception fails when the user forgets it, which is why methods that remove that responsibility are the most effective, she said. . The current iPledge system is cumbersome and does not work well, and has led to underprescription of this important medication, according to Dr. Marie C. Leger, a dermatologist at New York University who wrote an accompanying editorial in JAMA Dermatology.  . After the implementation of IPledge at Kaiser Permanente, prescriptions to men dropped by 20 percent and by 36 percent to women, Leger told Reuters Health by email. . Isotretinoin is the only real acne “cure” and an important treatment option, she said. . “Isotretinoin is not usually indicated for mild acne but if I have patients who are developing scars, who have severe cystic acne, or who have failed multiple other treatments I want them to know that it is an option,” Leger said. . “I monitor all of my patients on the medication very carefully - and while it certainly does have serious risks, it really is a life changing medication for many people,” she said. .

Courtney Sherwood|PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Public health officials are working to identify and offer antibiotics to about 20 University of Oregon students who attended a fraternity party at the home of a man diagnosed this week with a potentially deadly meningococcemia infection, authorities said on Wednesday.  . The student at whose home the party was held was the third person in less than a month from the University of Oregon to contract meningococcemia, a bacterial precursor to meningitis that can also lead to damaging blood infections. . “He was physically there at the gathering, but he would have had to be within three meters of someone to transmit an infection,” said Jason Davis, spokesman for Lane County Public Health. He also declined to name the fraternity involved. . “He was in the kitchen chatting with a few people, then had homework and left the main gathering, so the exposure risk was relatively low,” Davis added. . He urged students who may have been exposed to meningococcemia to reach out to public health officials and also said the recent outbreak is a reminder that vaccines are available to prevent infection.     . Some students who attended the party have been hesitant to speak with public health officials, somewhat slowing the public health response.     . “We know what our intentions are – to help protect the community and the student body, but when public health starts investigating, it can be intimidating for some people to have a government agent with a clipboard asking questions about their lives,” Davis said. “That hesitation puts a crimp in our process, but it’s understandable.” . The male University of Oregon student diagnosed on Monday and a female student diagnosed on Feb. 3 are both recovering well from their infections, Davis said, but a female student diagnosed on Jan. 16 has had more difficulty recovering. |Wed Feb 11 20:41:57 +0000 2015||Students sought who partied with Oregon man stricken by meningococcal disease |5.656117214996316e+17|http://reut.rs/1FzDYaT
Robin Respaut|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Commuters on San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit system may have been exposed to measles last week after an East Bay resident with the disease rode a BART train to and from work in the city for three days while infectious, public health officials said on Wednesday. . The infected BART rider marks the first case of measles documented by Contra Costa County health officials during an outbreak of the virus that has infected more than 100 people in California since December. . Fewer than 10 of those cases have been diagnosed in the San Francisco Bay area. Most have occurred in Southern California, many linked to exposure to an infected person who visited the Disneyland resort in late December. . Contra County health officials sought to reassure the public that the infected BART train rider did not pose a high risk of contagion to other passengers. . “Although the risk of contracting measles by being exposed on BART is low, Bay Area residents should be aware of the situation,” the county public health department said in a statement. . The infected person traveled between the Lafayette station in the East Bay and the Montgomery station in San Francisco during the morning and evening rush-hour commutes on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week.  . That ride is 35 minutes long, but health officials said that the highly infectious, airborne virus could have remained in the air for up to two hours. Because BART cars circulate throughout the Bay area, anyone who used the transit system during that time could have potentially been exposed . “Even if the rider got off BART at Montgomery station, commuters for the next hour or two could have been exposed,” said Erika Jenssen, Contra Costa County’s communicable disease programs chief. . Nearly 400,000 ride BART each weekday on average, but the number of passengers who rode the same line or the same train cars during those hours was not immediately known. . Public health officials were tracing the movements of the person, who is recovering and not hospitalized, and notifying others known to have had close contact, the statement said. It said the person’s employer is cooperating with the inquiry to ensure the safety of any co-workers who may have been exposed. . The infected person also spent time at the E&O Kitchen and Bar in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, potentially exposing others who were in the restaurant between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., health officials said.     . Individuals who are vaccinated or have had measles before are extremely unlikely to catch the disease, even if they had contact with a contagious person. However, those who were not previously vaccinated are at high risk if exposed. |Wed Feb 11 19:59:18 +0000 2015||San Francisco Bay Area transit rider had measles on train |5.6560098873286246e+17|http://reut.rs/1AYPJJ9

Caroline Humer|NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Security experts are warning healthcare and insurance companies that 2015 will be the “Year of the Healthcare Hack,” as cybercriminals are increasingly attracted to troves of personal information held by U.S. insurers and hospitals that command high prices on the underground market. .     Anthem Inc, the No. 2 U.S. health insurer, last week disclosed a massive breach of its database containing nearly 80 million records, prompting investigations by state and federal authorities. That hack followed a breach last year at hospital operator Community Health Systems, which compromised some 4.5 million records. .     “People feel that this will be the year of medical industry breaches,” said Dave Kennedy, chief executive of TrustedSEC LLC. .     In the past decade, cybercriminals focused their efforts on attacking banks and retailers to steal financial data including online banking credentials and payment card numbers. But as those companies boost security, using stolen credit card numbers has become more difficult.  . Their prices on criminal exchanges have also dropped, prompting hackers to turn to the less-secure medical sector, just as the amount of digital healthcare data is growing dramatically, Kennedy said. . Stolen healthcare data can be used to fraudulently obtain medical services and prescriptions as well as to commit identity theft and other financial crimes, according to security experts. Criminals can also use stolen data to build more convincing profiles of users, boosting the success of scams. . “All of these factors are making healthcare information more attractive to criminals,” said Rob Sadowski, marketing director at RSA, the security division of EMC Corp. . RSA Executive Chairman Art Coviello recently wrote in a letter to customers that he expected well-organized cybercriminals to turn their attention to stealing personal information from healthcare providers. . “A name, address, social and a medical identity ... That’s incredibly easy to monetize fairly quickly,” said Bob Gregg, CEO of ID Experts, which sells identity protection software and services. Identities can sell for $20 apiece, or more, he said. .     Insurers, medical equipment makers and other companies say they have been preparing for breaches after seeing the waves of attacks on other industries.  .     Cigna Corp has looked to financial and defense companies for best practices, including hiring hackers to break into its systems, said Chief Executive David Cordani. Attempts to break into corporate systems to probe for information are a constant, he said in an interview.  . St Jude Medical Inc CEO Daniel Starks said the company increased investment in cybersecurity significantly over the last few years, to protect both patient data and the medical devices it manufactures. . “You may see from time to time law enforcement briefings on nation-based (intellectual property) issues, espionage,” he said. “Those are things that we take very seriously and have been briefed on and that we work to guard against.”  .     The FBI is investigating the Anthem breach alongside security experts from FireEye Inc.  . The insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna Inc have warned investors about the risks of cyber crime in their annual reports since 2011.  . UnitedHealth has said the costs to eliminate or address the threats could be significant and that remediation may not be successful, resulting in lost customers. .     In response to the Anthem attack, UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in an emailed statement: “We are in close contact with our peers in ... the industry cybersecurity organization, and are monitoring our systems and the situation closely.” . Aetna has cited the automated attempts to gain access to public-facing networks, denial of service attacks that seek to disrupt websites, attempted virus infections, phishing and efforts to infect websites with malicious content.  . Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said in a statement: “We closely follow the technical details of every breach that’s reported to look for opportunities to continually improve our own IT security program and the health sector’s information protection practices broadly.” |Wed Feb 11 18:44:53 +0000 2015||Experts warn 2015 could be 'Year of the Healthcare Hack' |5.655822593158308e+17|http://reut.rs/1FzgyCp
Saliou Samb|CONAKRY/DAKAR (Reuters) - The number of new Ebola cases rose for the second week in a row in West Africa, nearly doubling in Guinea, suggesting declines in the disease seen earlier this year had stalled, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . Efforts to wipe out the deadly virus were being hampered by people’s mistrust of health workers, and the number of people continuing to hide sick friends and relatives from authorities, particularly in Guinea’s capital Conakry, officials said. . West Africa recorded 144 new confirmed cases of Ebola in the week to Feb. 8 compared with 124 the previous week, the WHO said in a report.  . “Despite improvements in case finding and management, burial practices, and community engagement, the decline in case incidence has stalled,” the U.N. agency said. . In Guinea, where the outbreak began, there were 64 new cases compared with 39 the previous week.  . “The main threat to achieving our goal of zero cases in 60 days is this resistance in Conakry,” Dr. Sakoba Keita, national coordinator for the fight against the epidemic in Guinea, said. . Guinea’s President Alpha Conde has announced a plan to have no Ebola cases by early March. . But in an illustration of the remaining challenges, youths from the Conakry suburb of Yimbaya spilled onto the streets on Monday, burning tyres after an imam suspected of conducting a secret Ebola burial was detained by authorities. . The U.N. said this week that 70 schools across the country had been unable to open because of local suspicions of medical kits being distributed to students. . The worst outbreak on record has now killed at least 9,177 people out of 22,894 recorded cases, mainly in the three worst-affected West African nations, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. . Sierra Leone remains the country with the highest transmission, although case numbers dropped week-on-week to 76 from 80. Liberia, once the epicentre of the outbreak, reported just three cases in the same period. . President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he was bringing back nearly all U.S. troops fighting the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and marking a new phase in the battle to help countries “get to zero” cases. Guinea has the longest way to go in ending the outbreak, he added. . Obama said wealthy countries needed to invest to ensure that poor nations have basic health systems to detect and fight diseases. . “This is not charity,” he said in a speech at the White House. “The investments we make overseas are in our self-interest.”  |Wed Feb 11 18:44:52 +0000 2015||West Africa sees spike in Ebola cases as decline stalls: WHO |5.6558225708025856e+17|http://reut.rs/1AYzMCD
Kathryn Doyle|The more depressive symptoms third grade teachers had in a new study, the less progress in math their struggling students made during the school year. . This was only an exploratory study of 27 teachers and it’s too soon to be treating depressed teachers as a problem that needs to be fixed, said the paper’s senior author, but the connection to kids’ learning could be important. . Teacher depression may be one of many factors that determine how well kids can learn, Carol McDonald Connor, a psychology professor at Arizona State University in Tempe, told Reuters Health. . “If the teacher’s depressed but so good at teaching math, those kids are probably fine,” she said. “But if the teacher is depressed and struggling with a new curriculum, that’s going to have a much larger impact.” . The researchers looked at data on 520 third grade students around age eight in 27 classrooms in North Florida during the 2010-2011 school year. In the winter, the teachers used a 20-item questionnaire to rate their frequency of depressive symptoms like loneliness, trouble sleeping and “the blues.” . Also in the winter, researchers used classroom video observations to rate the quality of the learning environment using individualized instruction, organization and teacher warmth as metrics. . As teacher depression symptoms increased, the learning environment tended to become poorer quality, according to the results published in Child Development. . Using the students’ scores on math and reading ability in the fall and spring, the researchers found that teacher depression was only associated with poorer math scores, and more strongly for kids who started the year with lower scores to begin with. . Students with weak fall math scores and a teacher with many depressive symptoms improved less by the spring than similar kids with teachers who had no or fewer depressive symptoms. . “Intuitively, you can expect an effect of teachers’ state on teachers’ classroom climate,” said Renzo Bianchi of the psychology lab at the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon, France, who was not involved in the study. . Teachers tend to have higher rates of depression than the general population, but researchers aren’t sure why, said the study’s coauthor Leigh McLean, a graduate research associate at Arizona State University. . “Something about the stress of teaching may leave teachers more vulnerable to depression, or it may also be that the type of person who becomes a teacher also tends to be more sensitive emotionally,” McLean told Reuters Health. “But we haven’t tested that explicitly.” . Teacher depression rates and the relationship to student learning may depend on other factors like socioeconomic level, but that would require a larger study, McLean said. . One theory is that depression makes it harder for teachers to maintain the optimal learning environment for kids, Connor said. For third graders, that means an active and dynamic environment rather than a lot of desk work, she said. . “Our assumption is that the really important interactions are in some way disrupted,” she said. . But the relationship may go in the other direction, which is something the researchers did not test, Bianchi noted. . “Poor classrooms can cause teacher depression and depressed teachers can create poorer quality classrooms,” Bianchi said. “A circular causal pathway is at stake here.” . There is some evidence for both directions, said Bridget Hamre, associate director of the Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. . “This study is just a reminder that teachers are people and that for all of us our mental health impacts our daily interactions with others,” Hamre told Reuters Health by email. “For teachers that just has a higher stake than it does for some of us who work in an office.”  . “It’s also just a nice reminder that we need to make sure that among all the discussion of school reforms we need to be thoughtful about creating work environments that can support teachers’ well-being,” she said. “Even the best curriculum won’t do any good in the hands of a teacher who is too overwhelmed and stressed out to implement it well or to develop positive relationships with students.” . One thing parents can do is get to know their children’s teachers and make sure they talk to their kids about what happens at school, Connor said. . “We don’t want teachers to become targets for blame,” McLean said. “We should promote a comprehensive understanding of mental health.” .

Gene Emery|(Reuters) - Grabbing and removing a clot blocking blood flow to the brain, rather than just administering clot-busting drugs, dramatically improves the likelihood that patients will recover from a stroke, according to two highly-anticipated studies released on Wednesday. . The larger of the studies found that the procedure nearly halved the death rate from stroke. . Because three previous studies had failed to show a benefit from procedures employing clot-removing devices, the latest research should renew interest in the devices and are likely to change stroke treatment, experts said. . The two studies used devices made by Covidien, which was acquired by Medtronic PLC last month and helped pay for one of the trials. Stryker Corp and privately-held Penumbra Inc also manufacture devices approved for clot removal. . The research echoes a large Dutch study published in December, called MR CLEAN, that also found a benefit from fishing a clot out of an artery. Taken together, they offer “a really persuasive signal that we’re on to something,” said Dr. Patrick Lyden, director of the Stroke Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies. . Lyden, who helped develop clot-busting drugs, said he had been skeptical of the devices, but called the latest results “tremendous,” adding, “it’s a whole new world for us. Medical centers are going to have to gear up and be able to do this treatment quickly.” . The two studies were reported at the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association International Stroke Conference in Nashville and released in summary form by the New England Journal of Medicine. . In one trial, called ESCAPE and conducted at 22 centers worldwide, 53 percent of 120 patients who had clot removal via a tube fed into a blood vessel of the brain were functionally independent 90 days later. Of the 118 who received only the standard clot-busting drug, 29 percent were. . While 19 percent of patients receiving drugs alone died within three months, only 10.4 percent of those whose clots were removed died. . The second study, called EXTEND-IA and based in Australia,     found that 24 hours after treatment all of the oxygen-starved brain tissue in 35 patients whose clot was removed was getting blood again. That compared to 37 percent of the tissue in patients receiving only the clot-busting drug alteplase. . After three months, 71 percent of the clot-removal group had achieved functional independence compared to 40 percent given conventional care. . Both trials were stopped early because the benefits of extracting the clot were so pronounced. . One reason the results were better than previous ones was that doctors were selective in whom they tried the procedure on, said Dr. Michael Hill of Canada’s University of Calgary, who led ESCAPE. . In particular, scans had to identify the blocked artery so physicians knew where to find the clot, and patients needed to have “collateral circulation,” or some blood flow bypassing the clot. . Without collateral circulation, Hill said, “the brain dies very quickly, even in 15 minutes. You can’t save those people.” . Another possible reason for success was speed: many of the clots were removed within 84 minutes, an hour faster than in trials that failed to show a benefit. |Wed Feb 11 17:17:14 +0000 2015||After stroke, clot removal saves brain function: studies |5.6556020112296346e+17|http://reut.rs/1AYeZ27
|GENEVA (Reuters) - An outbreak of plague in Madagascar has slowed but 71 people among the 263 known to have caught the disease since last September have died, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. . Madagascar has suffered an outbreak of plague nearly every year since 1980 and case numbers have increased in the past three years, making it the most severely affected country worldwide.  . The latest outbreak peaked in November and December but the plague season continues until April. The spread of the disease could have been hastened by heavy rains and flooding in January, the WHO said.  . The bacterial disease is mainly spread by flea-carrying rats. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which swells the lymph node and can be treated with antibiotics, the WHO says. . “However, control of plague outbreaks in Madagascar has been complicated by development of resistance to deltamethrin — the first-line insecticide –- in the fleas that transmit the disease from rats to humans,” it said. . The most heavily affected area, the district of Amparafavarola in the central highlands, had cases of pneumonic plague — the least common but most virulent form of the disease — up to the first week of January, WHO said. . Pneumonic plague can kill within 24 hours and is invariably fatal if not treated.  . Thirteen cases of plague were detected in the slum areas of Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo by the end of December, WHO said.    |Wed Feb 11 14:50:24 +0000 2015||Spread of plague slows in Madagascar, death toll at 71: WHO |5.655232506301194e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fyp1FS
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama singled out office supply company Staples Inc as undercutting his healthcare reform law and said large corporations should not use the health insurance issue as an excuse for cutting wages, the news website BuzzFeed reported. . “It’s one thing when you’ve got a mom-and-pop store who can’t afford to provide paid sick leave or health insurance or minimum wage to workers ... but when I hear large corporations that make billions of dollars in profits trying to blame our interest in providing health insurance as an excuse for cutting back workers’ wages, shame on them,” Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed. . The Affordable Care Act requires companies with more than 50 employees to pay for health insurance for people who work 30 hours a week or more.  Reuters has reported that some businesses are keeping staffing numbers below 50 or cutting the work week to less than 30 hours to avoid providing employee health insurance.     . Staples, the No. 1 U.S. office supplies retailer, has told its employees not to work more than 25 hours per week, according to a Buzzfeed report on Monday. . Staples Chief Executive Officer Ronald Sargent brought home $10.8 million in total compensation in 2013. The company reported net profit of $620.1 million through Feb. 1, 2014. . “There is no reason for an employer who is not currently providing health care to their workers to discourage them from either getting health insurance on the job or being able to avail themselves of the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said in the interview Tuesday. . “I haven’t looked at Staples stock lately or what the compensation of the CEO is, but I suspect that they could well afford to treat their workers favorably and give them some basic financial security, and if they can’t, then they should be willing to allow those workers to get the Affordable Care Act without cutting wages,” Obama said. . Staples shot back on Wednesday, saying the company’s policy on part-time workers was more than a decade old and not a response to the 2010 health care law, known as Obamacare. . “Unfortunately, the president appears not to have all the facts,” Staples spokesman Kirk Saville said in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that the president is attacking a company that provides more than 85,000 jobs and is a major tax payer.”  . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce criticized Obama’s remarks, which it said were based on “incomplete facts.” . “We’re happy to see the president finally acknowledge that some of his policies are far too costly for mom-and-pop shops,” said Blair Latoff Holms, spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It’s unfortunate this administration continues to publicly challenge companies and in this instance apparently with incomplete facts.” . Nearly 7.5 million people have signed up for 2015 Obamacare health plans through HealthCare.gov with demand increasing as the Feb. 15 enrollment deadline approaches, according to government figures. . Staples and No. 2 office retailer Office Depot Inc announced last week a $6.3 billion plan to join forces to compete against big box stores and online rivals. |Wed Feb 11 13:49:46 +0000 2015||Obama slams Staples, big companies on healthcare: 'Shame on them': BuzzFeed |5.6550799367316275e+17|http://reut.rs/1AXpenj
Alisa Tang|BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indonesian officials have dropped a plan to require female students to pass virginity tests in order to graduate from high school and apologized after sparking a public outcry, human rights campaigners said on Wednesday. . Habib Isa Mahdi, a lawmaker from Jember in East Java province, said last week that the district council was drafting a “good conduct” regulation that would include a virginity test as many high school students were having pre-marital sex. . Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, last year admitted conducting virginity tests on women seeking to join the police or military even though the practice has no scientific validity, according to the World Health Authority. . The Jember proposal sparked widespread condemnation, although local lawmakers in East Java’s third largest urban area with a population of 330,000 defended the move and hoped it could be expanded across the Jember area of 2.3 million people. . “If they’re not virgins any more, don’t let them pass,” local lawmaker Mufti Ali was quoted in local media as telling news site Berita.Jatim.com. . “We can’t test the boys ... but at least with the regulation, girls will be afraid. The boys will be prevented from the act because girls will become unwilling.” . Indonesia’s top Muslim clerics opposed the proposal, saying it discriminated against female students and was contrary to Islamic teachings. . Previous attempts to introduce virginity tests for female students, in South Sumatra in 2013 and in West Java in 2007, also backfired. . Many Indonesians place a high value on virginity, but pre-marital sex is not uncommon among the younger generation. The age of consent for heterosexual sexual activity is 19 for males and 16 for females. . Amid public outrage, Jember’s council deputy speaker Ayub Junaidi backed away from the proposal and apologized. . “On behalf of the Jember Consultative Council we’d like to apologize to the public, especially to all women and girls across Indonesia,” he told local news site Kompas.com. . Campaign group Human Rights Watch welcomed the Jember lawmakers’ U-turn but spokesman Andreas Harsono said it was alarming that the test was still used by the police and military. . Indonesia’s police force came under fire three months ago for admitting it administered virginity tests for female police applicants to see if their hymen was intact. A police spokesman said the tests were part of a routine health check but there was no requirement for women to be virgins and no discrimination. . HRW has called for an end to the Indonesian government’s  tolerance of female virginity tests. . “It should be stopped ... it is degrading. It is discriminatory. It is cruel,” Harsono told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Jakarta. |Wed Feb 11 13:49:46 +0000 2015||Indonesia lawmakers drop virginity tests for female students after uproar |5.6550799167667405e+17|http://reut.rs/1FycmTx
|MANILA (Reuters) - A Filipino nurse, who arrived last week from Saudi Arabia, has tested positive for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the first case of the deadly virus in the Philippines, the health ministry said on Wednesday. . The World Health Organization is worried about the spread of MERS, a respiratory disease known to have infected at least 965 people, of whom some 357 have died, overwhelmingly in Saudi Arabia. . Lyndon Lee Suy, a spokesman for the Department of Health, said the female nurse was undergoing treatment at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. . “The nurse had bouts of fever, body pain, cough and difficulty in breathing - symptoms similar to a patient with MERS-CoV,” he told a news conference. . “Testing was done which yielded positive results. The patient is in stable condition.” . Lee Suy said health authorities were conducting a contact tracing for 225 other passengers on board Saudi Airlines Flight 860. Her husband, who also arrived on the same flight on Feb. 1, tested negative.  . First reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, about 30 percent of people confirmed to have caught the viral respiratory illness MERS-CoV have died.  . Nine countries in the Middle East have had confirmed cases while 13 other states, now including the Philippines, have had travel-associated cases, or cases that they have diagnosed but which originated overseas. .

|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain’s decision to stop direct flights to Ebola-hit countries had “no scientific justification”, probably increased the cost of dealing with the outbreak and should be reversed, a parliamentary watchdog said on Wednesday. . Several airlines including British Airways and Emirates stopped flights last year to countries in West Africa affected by the worst outbreak of Ebola since the deadly virus was identified in 1976. . In September, independent health advisers to the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that there should be no general ban on travel or trade with Ebola-affected areas. . WHO, along with other agencies, said the ban had hampered efforts to deal with the disease and made it hard for experts to reach victims. . “The revocation of licenses to carriers to fly direct to the region was a political decision with no basis in science and was inconsistent with World Health Organization advice,” the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinizes government spending, said in a report drawing on evidence from experts. . “These (direct flights) should be restored as soon as possible.” . Nearly 9,000 people, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, have died of Ebola out of more than 22,400 known cases, according to the WHO. . Department of Transport officials were not immediately available for comment. . BA, which suspended flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone last August, said it would keep the ban in place because of concern about the public health situation in both countries. . “We will keep the routes under review in the coming months,” it said in a statement. . The committee also criticized the Department for International Development (DFID) for failing to respond to the crisis with enough urgency. . It said DFID should focus on strengthening healthcare systems in the region so they could cope better with future public health emergencies. . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said Britain’s response to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone had “saved lives, not cost lives”. . To date, DFID has announced a contribution of more than 5 million pounds ($7.65 million) to fight the outbreak. . “The UK cannot disease-proof every developing country in the world from potential unprecedented outbreaks, but we can offer our full support when they strike, as we did in Sierra Leone before any other country and at considerable risk to British lives,” Greening said in a statement. . “Everyone agrees that the World Health Organization should have reacted faster and the global system must reform to improve collective detection and reaction.” .

Sharon Bernstein|ASHLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - When Melissa Orion’s unvaccinated baby contracted whooping cough, she was grateful for modern medicine - its emergency rooms and even its antibiotics. . But the Ashland, Oregon, mom did not question her decision not to inoculate her child, and still does not, despite the  outbreak of measles in some 20 U.S. states, linked to California’s Disneyland park, that has infected more than 120 people. . “I put him on antibiotics,” the 31-year-old artist said. “But I felt the risk of vaccine was worse.”     . College-educated, middle-class and white, Orion is like many in this quaint city of 21,000 just north of the California border who have declined to vaccinate their children. . As measles cases have spread in the United States and a new outbreak of mumps has sickened at least 23 people in the northwest states of Idaho and Washington, much attention has been focused on parents who decline some or all vaccinations for their children.  . In Ashland, a quarter of kindergarteners started school last year without all their vaccinations, among the highest rates in the country. None of the community’s public schools has the 92 percent of vaccinated kindergarteners needed to provide the so-called herd immunity that protects those who are vulnerable to infection. . But persuading the community’s independent-minded, frequently affluent families to change their views is a perplexing task for public health officials, who are more used to helping the poorest and least educated parents find free or low-cost vaccinations than having to argue people out of deeply held convictions. . So some are retooling their messages, meeting with families one-on-one, and toning down sometimes strident rhetoric. . “We needed to change our tone,” said nurse Becky Sherman, project manager for the county’s Ashland Immunization Team, which was set up in 2011. . The new approach may be working. . Officials in Ashland, famous for its Shakespeare Festival,  pitched a child health website to a 12th grade or higher reading level, while noting that parents who refrain from vaccinating are doing so out of concern for their babies. . Over the past three years, the number of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated school children in Ashland has dropped from nearly 30 percent to less than 25 percent, said Samuel Bogdanove, director of student services at the Ashland Public Schools.  . The county’s child health website uses what Sherman calls respectful “Ashland-speak” to address parents. . “Whatever your current views are on vaccines and immunizations, this site is designed to serve as a resource for you,” the site says. . That is a far cry from many outreach efforts, which tend to be more strident, and not always effective.     . A study published in the journal Pediatrics last year looked at four arguments for parents who declined measles vaccinations for their kids. . The researchers shared photographs of sick children, told of an infant who almost died, distributed information about the dangers of measles, and debunked a feared link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism. . None of the messages worked. And the one shooting down the autism connection backfired. . “When you challenge people’s beliefs they tend to try to defend them,” said Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, who worked on the study. “We should test the messaging we use to make sure it’s not counter-productive.”  . CENTURIES-OLD DISTRUST  . Vaccine skepticism dates back to smallpox inoculation in the late 1700s, when many feared they would instead contract the disease. Bad reactions to the polio vaccine led to its refusal by some parents in the 1950s and 1960s, and a now-discredited paper linking the measles vaccine to autism in 1998 sparked the latest round. . Other parents cite the preservative thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound found in trace amounts in some vaccines, or believe kids are healthier if their immune systems develop naturally. . While most Americans do immunize their children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 20 U.S. states allow public school students to take exemptions from vaccines based on personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . Pockets of vaccine-refusal have grown in these states, including wealthy Marin County in California’s San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Colorado.  . In Sacramento, public charter schools serving immigrants from the former Soviet Union have vaccination rates well below the 92 percent needed to keep diseases like measles at bay. At one campus run by the non-profit Gateway Community Charters, just 45 percent of kindergartners are fully immunized, data show. . “All the other kids are coughing and sneezing and mine are great,” said Inna Lastovskiy, a mother of five who fully vaccinated only her oldest child. . To better communicate with parents, Gateway hired a public health nurse, Gina Warkentin, who has been meeting with families privately. . “My intention is to educate people, not to offend anyone,” Warkentin said. Sometimes she urges them to start with a single vaccine. . Over the past two years, the number of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children in Gateway schools has dropped, said Assistant Superintendent Michael Gillespie.  . “Different parents need different types of information and they need information provided in a different way,” said Amanda Cohn, deputy director for immunization services at the CDC. . For example, she said, persuading Amish parents to vaccinate after a measles outbreak last year in Ohio required a different approach than would work with Internet-savvy parents in California. Nationwide, 92 percent of children were vaccinated against measles in 2013, up from 91 percent the prior year, the CDC said. . In Ashland, a chicken pox outbreak in December forced the cancellation of two popular holiday events and sidelined 30 students, said Jackson County public health chief Dr. James Shames. Afterward, some parents rushed to have their children vaccinated, Shames said. . But not Hannah Wirth, 34. . “It scares me,” Wirth said. “The mercury and other chemicals in vaccines don’t seem natural to put in the body.” |Wed Feb 11 12:22:20 +0000 2015||Softer, less strident outreach may help calm U.S. vaccine skeptics |5.654859891128607e+17|http://reut.rs/1FxWlgk
|MAPUTO (Reuters) - A cholera outbreak in parts of Mozambique hit by floods has killed 19 people, the government said, raising the death toll from one of the worst disasters to hit southern Africa in years. . Another 158 people have died in Mozambique in flooding triggered by heavy rains at the start of the year, which also affected Malawi, Madagascar and Zimbabwe. . Mozambique’s deputy health minister Mouzinho Saide said late on Tuesday that flooded rivers had started to subside in the country’s northern and central provinces, easing the plight of some 177,000 people affected by the rain storms. . Neighbor Malawi has said 276 people were killed or are missing as the region counts the human and economic costs of torrential rains.

Roberta Rampton|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set to announce on Wednesday that he will bring back nearly all of the 1,300 U.S. troops deployed in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic by April 30, the White House said late on Tuesday. . Obama, who was excoriated last fall for a slow start to his Ebola outbreak response, will hold a White House event to showcase how U.S. leadership helped stem the epidemic, which has killed almost 9,000 people, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . The number of new cases each week has dropped to about 150 in recent reports, down from more than 1,000 new cases per week in October, the White House said. . “We are encouraged by the declining number of new Ebola cases in West Africa, but remain concerned about a recent increase in cases in Guinea, and an inability to further reduce case counts in Sierra Leone,” the White House said in a statement. . “Moreover, given that a single case can lead to flare-ups of the virus, we must not lose focus,” the White House said, noting about 100 U.S. military personnel will remain in West Africa to help. . At the height of the epidemic, about 2,800 military personnel were deployed to West Africa. . Troops built 10 Ebola treatment units and a medical unit to treat infected healthcare workers. . At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States, four of them diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil. . Only two people are known to have contracted the virus in the United States - both of them nurses who treated an Ebola patient from Liberia who became sick and died in Dallas. . After that incident, which happened during the U.S. midterm election campaign, Obama named former White House adviser Ron Klain to coordinate government activities. Klain’s job is slated to wrap up this week. . Obama secured more than $5.4 billion from Congress to fight the disease in West Africa and at home. Some of those funds are being used to support the development of Ebola vaccines and therapeutic drugs. . “This money will still be used as we do the hard work of trying to get to zero [Ebola cases] and continue to invest in domestic preparedness for this and other highly infectious diseases,” an administration official said, speaking on background. . The government has worked to train U.S. hospital workers to detect and handle Ebola cases, and ramped up screening of people returning from countries where Ebola raged. . About 7,700 people returning from Ebola-afflicted countries were screened at U.S. airports and were required to watch for symptoms and report to health authorities for 21 days. |Wed Feb 11 01:45:16 +0000 2015||Obama to bring back most U.S. troops fighting Ebola in Africa |5.6532566568023654e+17|http://reut.rs/1FwjSOH
Courtney Sherwood|PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - The University of Oregon is facing an outbreak of potentially deadly meningococcemia infections, with three students diagnosed with the condition in less than a month, public health officials said on Tuesday. . Meningococcemia is a bacterial precursor to meningitis and can also lead to damaging blood infections, said Jason Davis, spokesman for Lane County Health and Human Services. . A male student diagnosed on Monday and a female student diagnosed on Feb. 3 both received early treatment and were expected to recover quickly, Davis said, but a female student diagnosed on Jan. 16 has had more difficulty recovering. . “Time will tell if she experiences long-term ramifications from the disease,” he added. . The University of Oregon is working with health officials to identify people who may have come into contact with infected students and to offer antibiotics as a preventive measure, school spokeswoman Jen McCully said. . Davis cautioned that the meningococcemia outbreak should not be cause for alarm for most students at the university. . “This is a disease that is hard to get,” he said. “If you haven’t been holding hands and sharing a soda, you are probably not at risk.” . Meningococcemia bacteria are common in the environment, but only spread with prolonged exposure, making outbreaks relatively rare, Davis said. . But it is not uncommon for one or two U.S. universities to report a small outbreak in any given year. Princeton University and the University of California at Santa Barbara both reported multiple cases in 2013. . Two new vaccines have recently been introduced to prevent the “type B” meningococcemia variation that’s been detected at the University of Oregon, while a “type a” vaccine has long been available, Davis said. Though recommended by the university, these vaccinations are not mandatory, he said. |Wed Feb 11 01:11:31 +0000 2015||Meningococcemia outbreak sickens three at the University of Oregon |5.653171717448827e+17|http://reut.rs/1AVeJky
|SEATTLE (Reuters) - Lesbians may be at higher risk of cervical cancer because they get fewer screenings than heterosexual women, due partly to doctors’ sometimes incorrect assumptions about their sexual history, University of Washington researchers said on Tuesday. . Although nearly all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to a human papillomavirus, or HPV, infection, healthcare providers often do not encourage lesbian patients to get regular HPV screenings, the researchers found. . That is because the disease is most commonly transmitted during heterosexual sex and doctors may wrongly assume lesbians have only had sex with other women, despite studies that have found most lesbians and their partners have had sex with men, researchers said. . A lack of testing can also occur at times because lesbians lack insurance or do not always have a need for pregnancy prevention checkups, or may not want to share their sexual orientation with doctors, the researchers said. .  “If we are serious about reducing the rates of cervical cancer in lesbians, an unbiased health assessment by a provider must ask the question: ‘Do you have sex with men, women or both?’” University of Washington School of Nursing professor Joachim Voss said in a statement. . Voss and Lindsay Waterman, an adult nurse practitioner at the Seattle-based university, analyzed medical literature and studies, including Pap screen rates, between 2000 and 2013, published in last month’s Nurse Practitioner journal. . “Ob-gyns should provide the same comprehensive gynecologic health care to lesbians and bisexual women as they do to heterosexual women, including Pap tests,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said. . Researchers were unable to quantify the overall rates of cervical cancer among lesbians compared with heterosexual women because cancer patients are not typically asked their sexual orientation, Voss said. . Screening every three years can detect abnormal cervical cells and pre-cancerous lesions in women ages 21 to 65, but lesbians are screened at rates 5 percent to 18 percent lower than heterosexual women because of the perceived lack of risk exposure, the researchers said. . HPV can be transmitted between women partners through both skin-to-skin contact and contact with sex toys. . Nearly eight of every 100,000 U.S. women are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually, the researchers said. |Wed Feb 11 00:42:16 +0000 2015||Doctors' assumptions on sex heighten lesbians' cervical cancer risk: study |5.6530981110206054e+17|http://reut.rs/1AV965O
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . Factors that can trigger pain in the lower back include working in awkward positions, being distracted, and being physically or mentally tired, a new study shows. . “Back pain is a major public health concern,” said Manuela Ferreira of The George Institute for Global Health at The University of Sydney, Australia, one of the study’s authors. “It’s among the leading causes of disability around the world.” . Ferreira and her colleagues interviewed nearly 1,000 people who developed sudden lower back pain in 2011 and 2012, asking whether they’d been exposed to any of 12 possible triggers in the two hours before their pain started.  . Overall, people were most likely to have sudden lower back pain in the morning. . Manual tasks involving awkward positions were tied to an eight-fold increase in risk for lower back pain, the researchers found. Manual tasks involving objects away from the body, animals or people, and unstable objects increased the risk of back pain between five and six times. . Being distracted during a task or activity increased the risk of sudden lower back pain by 25 percent, they found. Being physically or mentally tired increased the risk about four times. . Alcohol consumption and sex were not tied to an increased risk of sudden lower back pain, however. . The new study can’t explain why certain things greatly increased the risk of back pain while others did not.  . There are some theories, however. For example, people may be at higher risk of back pain in the morning because they may not be fully alert yet. Or, Ferreira said, the disks in the spine might be more susceptible to damage in the morning. . She said people who are used to lifting heavy objects probably know how to do it safely, but people should ask for guidance from doctors or physical therapists if they’re unsure. . “Back pain will affect about 10 percent of the world’s population at some point in their lives,” Ferreira and her colleagues wrote February 9 online in Arthritis Care and Research. . “Although we have many studies looking at the interventions for back pain, we don’t have a lot of knowledge about prevention,” Ferreira said. . “People who are not involved with these activities on a daily basis, they should pay attention to how they’re lifting,” she advised. “Even brief exposures to those activities can lead to back pain.” . Also, she said, it helps to be physically and mentally strong, with a healthy diet and regular exercise. . SOURCE: .   .

|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Describing the latest measles outbreak as “alarming,” Dr. Margaret Hamburg, outgoing commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said on Tuesday that the measles vaccine “should be used by everyone who has not been vaccinated.”  . Her comments, published in a blog post on the FDA’s website, come as the United States battles a resurgence of the disease, driven by fears among some parents of an association between vaccines and autism - fears that experts say have no basis in science. . Hamburg said vaccination is the single best way to prevent the spread of the disease. . “Simply put, these vaccines are safe and effective, and serious side effects are rare,” she said. . This year more than 120 people across 17 states have been infected with measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, 644 cases were reported, the highest number since the disease was effectively eliminated from the United States in 2000. . Before the measles vaccination program began in 1963, three to four million people were infected with measles each year, of whom 400 to 500 died, another 48,000 were hospitalized and others developed pneumonia, brain damage or deafness. . “Let’s not return to these grim statistics,” Hamburg said. |Tue Feb 10 21:59:51 +0000 2015||FDA Commissioner says measles outbreak 'alarming' |5.652689376850944e+17|http://reut.rs/1FvCcri
Elzio Barreto|HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors are rushing into China’s booming healthcare business, helping M&A deal values surpass those of the hot Internet sector, as the country prepares to cater to hundreds of millions of elderly patients. . Encouraged by a relaxation of foreign ownership rules last year and a rapidly ageing population, private equity firms such as TPG Capital [TPG.UL] and industry players including Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare Bhd are investing in Chinese hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and device makers. . The prospect of 223 million people aged 65 or older predicted to live in China by 2030 is just too enticing for these companies, despite significant risks such as weak hospital infrastructure, rising valuations and a dearth of doctors. . The companies have begun leveraging connections of local partners to hire doctors, and to help expedite local licenses and permits to start work on planned projects. . China has forecast healthcare spending by the private sector, state-owned enterprises and consumers to treble to 8 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) over the next five years, as it tries to cope with the boom in its ageing population, a result of the country’s decades-long one-child policy and current low fertility rate. .     “I spend 70 percent of my time looking for healthcare deals in China,” said Steve Wang, co-founder of Hong Kong-based private equity firm Pine Field Capital. “It’s a really hot sector in China, as hot as mobile Internet.” . After years of steady growth, China healthcare mergers and acquisitions more than doubled to a record $18.5 billion in 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed. This January alone, deals  totaled $6.9 billion, an acceleration in activity that points to another blockbuster year. .     Deals involving China’s ecommerce, Internet software, services and infrastructure also reached a record in 2014, but with $17.9 billion they trailed healthcare. .     China started to liberalize its healthcare sector in 2009  but it was only in 2014 that it allowed full foreign ownership of hospitals, further deregulated drug prices and implemented rules to fast-track the approval of medical devices. . That optimism has pushed valuations for some firms steadily higher. Phoenix Healthcare Group Co. Ltd, China’s No.1 private hospital group, listed in Hong Kong in December 2013 at 25.1 times its expected earnings. It now trades around 35 times. . Other risks for prospective investors in China, where government policies are often unpredictable, include lack of doctors and the lengthy approval process for hospital licenses. . The country had 14.6 physicians per 10,000 people in 2012 compared with 38.5 in Australia, 24.2 in the United States and 17.6 in Brazil, according to World Health Organization data. . “When you look at the hospital and provision sector in particular, the point around doctor availability is an important one,” said Vikram Kapur, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. “So the risk to be managed is around making sure that you can attract enough physicians to private institutions.” . TPG, Blackstone Group LP and Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd are among investors that have already bought into hospitals, medical device makers and service providers in China. . “We are very positive on the New China, especially the healthcare sector,” said Kinger Lau, chief China strategist at Goldman Sachs. “The concept of reform in the healthcare sector is very appealing from an investment point of view as living standards improve and the population ages.” . IHH Healthcare, Asia’s largest hospital operator, already has a hospital in Shanghai and smaller clinics in the country and is in talks to expand further in China, Chairman Abu Bakar Suleiman told Reuters.  . “China is big, so it’s not just about going into Beijing and Shanghai,” Suleiman said. “For the private sector, these are very early days. We feel it’s a good thing for us to come in now.” .

Kathryn Doyle|People who travel to exotic locales and take along their own antibiotics are more likely to come back colonized with resistant bacteria, according to a new Finnish study. . Many travelers take along antibiotics to treat so-called “traveler’s diarrhea” - and if they have the medications along, they are likely to use them even for minor ailments, according to lead author Dr. Anu Kantele of Helsinki University Central Hospital. . In most cases this is a bad idea, she said.  . “If you have mild or moderate diarrhea, you will not need antibiotics” but should drink lots of fluids and, if needed, take medication that relieves the diarrhea like loperamide (Imodium), if you brought any, she said. . Severe diarrhea might require antibiotics, but it also requires a medical evaluation, she said. Diarrhea can be a symptom of other, more severe diseases such as malaria. It can be dangerous to try to self-manage malaria with the wrong medication, she said. . “At home we doctors always recommend seeking medical care when you are very sick,” Kantele said. “Why on earth would we advise anyone to decide differently in a developing country?” . She and her coauthors collected stool samples from 430 Finns before and after travel outside Scandinavia and tested them for two strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, known as extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. . Overall, 288 of the 430 travelers experienced diarrhea while abroad. Sixty-six travelers took antibiotics during the trip, and 52 used the drugs to treat diarrhea, according to a report of the study in Clinical Infectious Diseases. . Twenty-one percent of the travelers were colonized with an antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria on their return, most often those who traveled to Southeast Asia. No one who traveled to Europe, Australia or the Americas tested positive for the bacteria. . Taking antibiotics increased the risk of contracting the resistant bacteria: 17 percent of people who took no antibiotics were colonized on their return, compared to 46 percent of those who took the drugs for traveler’s diarrhea.  . “The majority of healthy travelers who get colonized have no symptoms and the bacteria disappear within a few months, so they never knew they carried it,” Kantele said. . But the bacteria can be dangerous for some. . “These drug-resistant organisms are not dangerous to healthy individuals but if they are transmitted to immune compromised or chronically ill persons who are unable to control the infection . . . it would be a major problem because most standard antibiotics will not work and there are limited drugs available to treat such infections,” said Dr. Jay S. Keystone of the Tropical Disease Unit at Toronto General Hospital. . Keystone coauthored an editorial published with the study. . These resistant bacteria should be treated and addressed both locally in the high-risk areas where they are and by preventing their spread around the world, keeping travelers from bringing them back to the home country, Kantele said. . “We need a big change in our attitude toward antibiotics, we need to respect them. When they are needed they can save our lives,” Kantele said. . People with a high fever or bloody stool while abroad may need medication, and the best choice is to see a doctor if at all possible, she said.  . As for carrying antibiotics on a trip, Kantele would recommend them “for travelers who go to remote areas, like Himalaya trekkers,” Kantele said. “Areas with poor access to healthcare.” . Keystone, however, said, “Personally, I would not leave home without an antibiotic and loperamide for travel to developing countries.” . “In many developing countries, especially in rural areas, one is at risk of receiving an injection with unsterile equipment, a counterfeit or inactive drug or inappropriate treatment or in a hospital setting, becoming colonized with a drug resistant organism,” Keystone told Reuters Health by email. . There are ways to prevent traveler’s diarrhea, like taking precautions with food and water sources, drinking commercially bottled beverages, avoiding salads and street food, Keystone said. . But, he added, travelers should still take antibiotics along when they depart, and use them wisely.  . SOURCE: .  and .

Laura Zuckerman|SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - Residents of an Idaho town were ordered on Tuesday to boil drinking water for a third day because of sediments in the public water supply that could harbor harmful parasites like cryptosporidium and strains of e-coli bacteria, officials said. . About 500 customers in Idaho City in the southwest part of the state were affected by the boil water order, which is in place indefinitely, state water quality managers said.  . Officials with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality said the municipal water supply in the mountain town was showing unsafe levels of turbidity even after being treated with disinfectants like chlorine.  . Turbidity is a measure of sediments and other materials in water that are considered likely to contain harmful parasites and bacteria when at levels above those established by federal safe-drinking water standards, said Todd Crutcher, engineering manager for the department. . The turbidity in the water system is tied to recent heavy rainfall and accelerated snowmelt in the mountainous region, which increased the amount of runoff of soils, woody debris and other materials entering a creek from which Idaho City draws surface water. . The local water supply periodically is out of compliance for turbidity during high water events usually seen in the spring, not winter, Crutcher added. . The timeline for when Idaho City households, restaurants and businesses can safely use tap water will depend on the lessening of runoff into the local creek, he said, adding that was dependent on weather.  . “The short-term resolution will come as water flushes through the system and the creek clears,” he said. . Rain is predicted in coming days for the area, which lately saw unseasonably warm temperatures that sped up melting of mountain snows. . Crutcher said Idaho City was taking steps to prevent seasonal contamination issues by installing groundwater wells that will allow it to avoid drawing from surface waters during high flows. |Tue Feb 10 21:12:36 +0000 2015||Idaho town under indefinite order to boil water to prevent illnesses |5.652570474162504e+17|http://reut.rs/1AUvex2
Kathryn Doyle|People with type 2 diabetes who get treatment for high blood pressure live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease, according to a new review. . But to the researchers’ surprise, diabetics with only slightly high blood pressure - higher than the healthy range but not quite in the hypertension range - didn’t get as much benefit from treatment. . “Everything else being equal,” the patients with type 2 diabetes most likely to benefit from blood pressure lowering are those whose blood pressure is higher, said coauthor Professor Kazem Rahimi of The George Institute United Kingdom and The University of Oxford, in email to Reuters Health. . The review included 40 trials from 1966 to 2014 on blood pressure lowering treatments in more than 100,000 people with type 2 diabetes. The treatments included diuretics (sometimes called “water pills”), ACE inhibitors, and other drugs. . A healthy blood pressure reading is 120/80 millimeters (mm) of Mercury (Hg). . Readings above 120/80 but below 140/90 indicate “pre-hypertension.” Blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg can be diagnosed as hypertension. . According to the new review, with every decrease of 10 mm Hg in the first number – the systolic blood pressure - the risk of dying during the study decreased by about 10 percent, and the risk of an acute heart problem, heart disease, stroke and diabetic retinopathy also went down. . Lowering blood pressure appeared to carry the most benefit for people whose initial systolic readings were higher than 140 mm Hg, the authors write in JAMA.  . “The study calls for more individualized treatment decisions when it comes to controlling blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes, in particular for diabetics with lower baseline blood pressure levels,” Rahimi said.  . Blood pressure medications did decrease the risk of other problems like stroke, diabetic eye disease and excess protein in the urine, even for people with relatively lower blood pressures, he said. . But diuretics can cause an increase in blood sugar for people with diabetes. Other side effects of blood pressure medications include impotence, potassium deficiency, skin rash or kidney damage.  . One in 10 Americans has diabetes today, most often type 2, the adult-onset kind, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two out of three people with diabetes have high blood pressure or take medication to lower it, according to the American Diabetes Association.  . “People with a blood pressure of 140 or higher are likely to enjoy the greatest benefit from blood pressure lowering, and for most, the benefits of taking blood pressure medication are likely to outweigh the potential side effects,” Rahimi said. “In people with systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg, treatment recommendation requires more careful assessment of the patient’s likely absolute net benefit.” . Based on one U.S. trial in 2010, blood pressure goals have been relaxed for people with diabetes, which may have been an overreaction, according to Dr. Bryan Williams of University College London, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. . Before that trial, most guidelines recommended that people with diabetes keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mm Hg. Afterward, some guidelines were relaxed to 140/90 mm Hg. . Rahimi’s study “shows that the current BP goals are not low enough to optimally reduce the risk of stroke, for example,” Williams told Reuters Health by email. . “Certainly BP should be lowered to below 140/90 mm Hg and I would suggest it would be appropriate to go lower than 130/80 if the patient will tolerate it and this is more likely to be tolerated better in younger people,” he said.  . “There is no magical threshold above which blood pressure suddenly becomes harmful and below which it becomes benign,” Williams said. “The thresholds are designed to simplify trials and guidance but in reality the risk relationship is continuous with no obvious threshold.” .

Emma Farge|DAKAR (Reuters) - Sierra Leone said on Tuesday it had cleaned up a list thought to contain thousands of “ghostworkers” on its Ebola staff and would prosecute those who sought to swindle money from the government, tackling a problem that has dogged its fight against the epidemic. . More than 10,000 Ebola cases have been reported in Sierra Leone since last May, making it the hardest hit country in the world’s worst outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever. The epidemic  has been concentrated in West Africa and killed nearly 9,000 people out of 22,495 known cases since December 2013.   . In Sierra Leone, payments to Ebola staff have repeatedly been frozen because of the difficulty distinguishing between genuine workers — such as ambulance drivers and grave diggers — and those forging their identities to claim hazard bonuses or registering twice to claim double pay. . The delays in payments have prompted frequent strikes by Ebola workers in the impoverished country, in some cases leaving patients untreated and highly contagious bodies unburied.  . “The issue of ghostworkers has been disingenuous on the part of some Sierra Leoneans who think this is time to make money when we are in a crisis,” said government spokesman Abdulai Bayraytay. “They were identified by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). They are being charged and prosecuted.”      . Bayraytay said that more than 95 percent of the thousands of declared government Ebola workers had now been verified, a factor expected to make payments easier. . He did not say how many “ghostworkers” had been weeded out of the system but a senior Sierra Leonean official told Reuters late last year there could be as many as 6,000, split between fraudsters and administrative errors. . A second source familiar with the matter said the ACC planned to bring charges against two people for fraud this week, and suggested the problem was not that widespread. . “There were isolated cases of people playing smart and getting double pay,” said the source, who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media.  . He said some rice stockpiles intended to feed people in quarantine had also gone missing, although denied there was a systematic attempt to exploit Ebola funds in the country. . Donors have so far paid or committed more than $530 million to Sierra Leone’s Ebola response, although only a fraction of that has been allocated directly to the government. |Tue Feb 10 20:07:14 +0000 2015||"Sierra Leone to prosecute fraudulent Ebola ""ghostworkers"" "|5.652405964877496e+17|http://reut.rs/1AUhNgO
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Tuesday set a goal of raising $2 billion in philanthropic investments to fight climate change, including technologies to slash carbon emissions. . The Clean Energy Investment Initiative is seeking  investments to try to bridge the “valley of death” - the gap in funding between research and development and commercialization that holds back many clean-energy startup companies - said Brian Deese, deputy director at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. . The plan requires no additional U.S. taxpayer money but uses “the convening power and technical know-how of the Department of Energy,” said Deese, who announced the plan at an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) annual conference, outside Washington. ARPA-E is an Energy Department office funding projects that have potential to revolutionize energy markets but are too risky for the private sector to invest in initially.  . President Barack Obama has made fighting climate change one of his top priorities. His administration will finalize first-ever U.S. rules to slow carbon emissions from power plants this summer.   . Several groups have already made commitments to the initiative, according to a White House fact sheet. For example, the University of California’s Board of Regents will allocate at least $1 billion of its endowment and pension over five years for investments in solutions to climate change. . As part of the plan, the White House will host a Clean Energy Investment Summit in coming months, as a forum for foundations and institutional investors to scale up investment in renewable energy innovation.  |Tue Feb 10 19:40:08 +0000 2015||Obama looks to raise $2 billion in climate change investments |5.652337769143501e+17|http://reut.rs/1AUcwG3

|DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government suffered an embarrassing setback on Tuesday when one of its lawmakers quit after voting in favor of an opposition bill to allow the abortion of unviable pregnancies. . Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s government retains a comfortable parliamentary majority but Labor deputy Anne Ferris’ defection is a blow for the coalition a year before an election in which Ireland’s abortion laws, among the most restrictive in Europe, are likely to be a major issue. . Ferris’ decision could also raise tensions between Kenny’s centre-right Fine Gael and its junior coalition partner, centre-left Labor, which is traditionally more supportive of abortion. . Under parliamentary rules, Ferris is automatically expelled from the Labor Party’s parliamentary group by voting against the government and will now sit as an independent member in the assembly. . Tuesday’s bill, which opposition lawmaker Clare Daly said would end the “cruel and inhumane” practice of pregnant women having to travel to Britain for abortions, was defeated by 104 votes to 20.   . The government has said it will only consider addressing the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities after the next election. It  ordered its deputies to vote against the bill because it believed it to be unconstitutional. . Ireland, where the once powerful Roman Catholic Church has lost much of its traditional moral influence in the wake of  child sex abuse scandals, ended its complete ban on abortion in 2013. It now allows terminations if the life of the mother is in danger, including by suicide. |Tue Feb 10 19:11:04 +0000 2015||Irish government loses lawmaker over abortion vote |5.652264600684544e+17|http://reut.rs/1AU6023
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. advisory panel reviewing national dietary guidelines has decided to drop its caution against eating cholesterol-laden food, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. . At a December meeting, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee discussed its decision to no longer deem cholesterol a “nutrient of concern,” according to the Washington Post.  . The last set of guidelines, in 2010, said to consume less than 300 milligrams per day of dietary cholesterol, about the amount in one egg.  . The committee will soon release a report - expected in the coming weeks - for the federal government to use as the basis of its dietary guidelines, and is withholding comment until the publication, said a spokeswoman from the Department of Health and Human Services. . “The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is currently finalizing its report to the federal government detailing its scientific recommendations,” HHS said in a statement.  . The committee did not reverse warnings on high levels of what is commonly considered “bad cholesterol,” which has been linked to heart disease and possibly other health problems. . For decades, the government has warned against diets high in cholesterol. But now many nutritionists believe that cholesterol intake may not significantly impact cholesterol blood levels or increase the risk of heart disease in healthy adults, according to the Washington Post. . The advisory panel’s report will be sent to HHS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agencies that decide which recommendations to incorporate in the final set of dietary guidelines, due at the end of this year.  . “We need to wait and see what the committee actually says before saying too much about this,” said New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle.  |Tue Feb 10 18:46:11 +0000 2015||U.S. may lower cholesterol's level of threat to health: report |5.6522019780061184e+17|http://reut.rs/1AU0rR9
Rod Nickel|WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian government will require pharmaceutical companies to post public notices when drugs are not available or face fines, Health Minister Rona Ambrose said on Tuesday. . Posting notices to a website about shortages is currently voluntary. The website, www.drugshortages.ca, lists more than 200 recent shortages of drugs made by companies including Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Pfizer Canada. . Reasons for shortages include manufacturing problems and unexpected increases in demand. . Drugmakers are already required in the United States to notify the Food and Drug Administration about shortages, including the reasons and expected duration. . Ambrose said in Vancouver that the voluntary system hasn’t worked well enough, citing an example of an unnamed drug company that refused to post information about the shortage of a cancer drug. . “It became clear to me that Canadians were not getting this essential information in a timely and reliable manner from all pharmaceutical companies,” she said. . Drug companies will be required to report actual and anticipated shortages on a website to be developed, once regulations take effect. In the meantime, manufacturers will be expected to post information on the voluntary site.  . The federal health department will also publicly list drug companies that commit to notification and post online letters to manufacturers that do not disclose information about shortages. . “This public register will name and shame those pharma companies,” Ambrose said. . Canada’s Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies, an association whose members include Merck Canada  and Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada, said it supported the move and that generic drug companies are connected with most drug shortages. . But Jeff Connell, vice president of corporate affairs for the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said that for some brand-name drugs there are up to 12 generic versions. . “Simple mathematics dictates that if, for example, there is a shortage of an active ingredient used to make a drug, this will impact one brand-name drug manufacturer but several generic drugs manufacturers,” Connell said. |Tue Feb 10 18:30:21 +0000 2015||Canadian government to require drug shortage notice |5.6521621523348685e+17|http://reut.rs/1ATXikc
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have better self esteem and less depression as young adults if they were open about their sexual orientations as adolescents, a new study suggests. . Attempts to hide sexual orientation are generally unsuccessful, and the result is more abuse and more depression, the authors say in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry. . What’s needed, said Stephen Russell, the study’s lead author, are “supporting environments so that all kids can figure out and be as true to themselves as they can be.”  . Research shows that adults fare better after disclosing their sexual orientations, but there was little evidence on how being “out” in middle or high school affects mental health later on. . That question occurred to Russell, an expert on adolescent mental health at the University of Arizona in Tucson, when a high school in Okeechobee, Florida attempted to block students from forming an LGBT-straight alliance group – also known as a gay-straight alliance. . The case was settled in the students’ favor, but an unanswered question was whether students end up better off later in life if they’re open about their sexual orientations, compared to those who are not. . “There was no real data to suggest otherwise, Russell said. . The new findings are from a study of 245 LGBT young adults in California, ages 21 to 25, who reported their openness with their sexual orientations during middle and high school. They also took surveys to measure depression, self-esteem and life satisfaction. . Not surprisingly, the researchers found, LGBT-related abuse at school was tied to negative adjustment during young adulthood. The abuse occurred whether the students tried to hide their sexual orientations or not. . “I think one of the sobering things we learned is that saying you’re out to others is linked to victimization and saying you need to hide was linked to victimization,” Russell said. . But after accounting for abuse, people who were “out” at school were better adjusted in young adulthood, compared to people who weren’t out. . The study can’t prove that being out as an adolescent guarantees better adjustment later on. And the researchers caution that the results can’t be applied to all LGBT youths. Russell hopes to confirm the findings in an ongoing study with nearly 900 participants. . Co-author Caitlin Ryan said the results point to the need for schools to have trained staff and policies that protect all students. . “We still have school settings where there aren’t policies in place,” said Ryan, director of the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University. . Sean Cahill, who was not involved with the new study but co-authored the 2012 book “LGBT Youth in America’s Schools,” agreed that it’s important to help youth to be out at school. . Ways to do that include statewide LGBT youth initiatives to help schools create safe environments, said Cahill, who directs health policy research at The Fenway Institute of Fenway Health, which provides healthcare to the LGBT community in Boston.  . Gay-straight alliances are known to create better school environments for students whether they’re out or not, he said. Also, having openly LGBT role models in schools is beneficial. . Teaching about LGBT historical figures, such as Walt Whitman and Gertrude Stein, also helps create an accepting environment, said Cahill. . For adolescents, Russell said, it’s beneficial to think through a plan of the coming out process, possibly with the help of adults. Plans should consider sources of support, and vulnerabilities, he said. . “I think what’s promising about this study is even though coming out comes with risks, being out is going to come with benefits in the long run,” he said. .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Smartphones and fitness bands are decent step counters, a small study finds, suggesting that millions of people who use these devices can reliably track how far they run or walk as they work to improve their health. . The newer gadgets aren’t as accurate as old-school pedometers, but they are ubiquitous. Smartphones can run step-counting apps, and fitness bands and other wearable health devices are gaining in popularity as more people use them to help with weight loss or getting in shape.  . “Overall, smartphones and wearables are accurate for the purposes that many people need, especially for sedentary people who need to increase their activity because they are overweight or obese and simply need to know if they reached the minimum amount of activity needed to maintain good health,” said lead study author Dr. Mitesh Patel of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, in a phone interview with Reuters Health. . While tracking on its own can’t necessarily improve health, 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week can reduce the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers as well as help strengthen muscles and bones, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . To test the accuracy of steps recorded by smartphones and wearable devices, Patel and colleagues got 14 volunteers to walk on treadmill set to a 3.0 mile-per-hour pace for 500 steps and again for 1,500 steps, repeating each distance twice.  . Participants walked while wearing a pedometer, the Digi-Walker SW-200; two accelerometers, the Fitbit One and Fitbit Zip; and three popular fitness wristbands, the Nike FuelBand, Jawbone UP24, and Fitbit Flex.  . In one pocket, they had an iPhone 5s simultaneously running three apps: Fitbit, Health Mate, and Moves. In the other pocket, they had a Galaxy S4 running Moves.  . Researchers counted steps by direct observation and then checked to see how close the smartphone apps and wearable devices came to reaching the same number of steps.  . As reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the pedometers and accelerometers did the best, on average missing the observed step count by 1 percent or less.  . Smartphones on average recorded from 6.7 percent fewer steps to 6.2 percent more, with iPhone apps slightly over-counting and the Galaxy app slightly under-counting. . The fitness wristbands under-counted, ranging from 1.5 percent to 22.7 percent fewer steps, with the FuelBand deviating the most.  . “It’s true we found some variation, but I would also say that our findings should be reassuring to people who want to use smartphone apps or wearables to track their activities,” Patel said. . If cost is a consideration, people who already have a smartphone might want to try the apps before investing in a fitness band, which can retail for more than $100, said Dr. David Geier, an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist based in Charleston who wasn’t involved in the study.  . For people who don’t have a smartphone, a simple pedometer might cost $10 to $30, he said. . “It’s tremendously helpful for motivation to have a realistic understanding of where you actually are and then track your own improvement,” Geier said. “Tracking on its own won’t make you lose weight or get healthier, but it can certainly help you get closer to at least the recommended 10,000 steps a day which very few people currently achieve.” . Where motivation is concerned, smartphones and fitness bands have a clear advantage over pedometers because there’s a potential for users to share results with friends on social media, said Heather Milton, Senior Exercise Physiologist at NYU Langone Medical Center’s Sports Performance Center. . “The impact of integrating social aspects to fitness has been proven time and time again to enhance adherence and success of healthy behavior change,” said Milton, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Whether it is support for some or the competition for others, this is a huge element of improving activity and health.” . Even if the device isn’t quite as accurate as a pedometer, it’s still better than not tracking steps at all, she said.  . Using these devices “increases mindfulness, a key to behavior change,” she added. “It is for this reason that people opt to walk rather than ride an elevator or escalator, or get up and walk every few hours at work.” .

Laila Kearney| (This version of the story changes name from Christopher to Kris in the 17th paragraph) . By Laila Kearney . DOWNINGTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - The desperate cry of a mother finding her 17-year-old son dead from a painkiller and another prescription drug instantly silences hundreds of Pennsylvania high school students who listen to her 911 call played at an early morning assembly. . That recording, played as the roughly 500 students look at an urn holding the dead boy’s ashes and photos of dozens of other teens who died of overdoses, is the gut-punch that anchors a new educational program aimed at combating the rising abuse of prescription opioid abuse among U.S. young adults. . “All these kids were around our age, said Michael Senn, an 18-year-old senior at the school Downingtown High School East, after the program. “It felt personal.” . Senn and his classmates had just sat through a presentation by Narcotics Overdose Prevention and Education, or NOPE, one of a handful of prevention programs cropping up around the United States offering high school and middle school students education about prescription opiate painkillers. . The new programs, launching in Pennsylvania and Illinois, come as concerns grow that the drugs, accounting for 71 percent of all prescription drug overdose deaths, are drawing younger and more suburban users. . Nationwide, prescription opioids caused more than 16,000 deaths across all ages in 2013, a 50 percent increase from three years before, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Law enforcement officials say that abuse of the drugs has also contributed to a spike in heroin usage and deaths from heroin overdoses as some opioid users switch to the cheaper narcotic. . In an approach that experts say may be more effective than generalized anti-drug curricula of the past, the new programs target painkillers, a narcotic of choice for teenagers. . Developers of the programs emphasize the of use lengthy studies and interactive computer programs and focus on the science of addiction instead of scare tactics widely used in Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign of the 1980s and 1990s. . Even with fresh ideas, experts say, the new programs face a rocky road to success. . “The whole field is sort of in withdrawal,” said William Hansen, who runs All Stars, a leading school drug-prevention provider based in Greensboro, North Carolina. . One of the biggest obstacles in the anti-drug program field - funding - was exacerbated in 2011, when money for the former Office of the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities, a financial lifeline to school prevention programs, was slashed. . Schools’ focus on academic testing in recent years has knocked anti-drug programs off of their priority lists, said Hansen, who recently began writing a grant proposal to add special prescription drug education to his curricula. . The new programs also come at a time of heightened criticism of anti-drug programs in schools. . The most-used school prevention program Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, launched in Los Angeles in 1983, has been criticized in multiple evaluations, including in a 2001 U.S. Surgeon General report, for failing to prove its effectiveness in deterring drug use.  . The “Just Say No” mantra has been openly mocked for being overly simplified.  . The new programs contend they have developed more effective strategies. . “Our program really is looking at adolescent brain development, addiction on a brain level,” said Kris Adzia, the program manager of an opioid-abuse prevention program at the Robert Crown Center for Health Education. . The Heroin Prevention Education program uses interactive software based on the life of a recovering teen heroin addict who began abusing opioid painkillers after having his wisdom teeth pulled and moved on to intravenous heroin use. . In hour-long programs, NOPE instructors teach students how to recognize symptoms of drug overdoses and emphasize the importance of quickly seeking medical attention for overdose victims. The programs also work to teach teens that prescription drugs are not safe to use other than under a doctor’s orders. . Around the same time that Chester County in Pennsylvania contracted with NOPE, schools in DuPage, Illinois, rolled out the curriculum developed by the Robert Crown Center. . Officials in other states are looking to follow suit. . Lawmakers in states including New Jersey, New York and Wisconsin have proposed measures to require public schools to educate students about the dangers of opioid drugs. . Downingtown School District prevention specialist Christina Forsythe said the first NOPE presentation at her high school appeared to be a success. . Senn, who sat at the back of the school’s auditorium with friend, Megha Reddy, 17, agreed but was cautious.  . “It will affect them,” he said of the presentation’s impact on his classmates. “How deeply it registers, I’m unsure of.”  |Tue Feb 10 15:41:30 +0000 2015||U.S. schools turn to new programs to warn teens of drug risks |5.651737222573097e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fugl3t
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - An experimental Ebola drug from Sarepta Therapeutics Inc protected six of eight lab monkeys injected with the virus, scientists from the company and the U.S. Army reported on Tuesday. . The drug, called AVI-7537, joins ZMapp from Mapp Biopharmaceutical and a compound from Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp as the agents shown to cure non-human primates given otherwise-lethal injections of Ebola virus. . The ZMapp and Tekmira drugs protected 100 percent of lab monkeys in studies, giving them a possible edge. But, unlike those, Sarepta’s drug has been formally tested in healthy human volunteers at high doses and caused no serious side effects. . While other experimental agents are in extremely limited supply or difficult to produce, there is a straightforward manufacturing system for Sarepta’s drug, said Steve Brozak, an analyst and president of WBB Securities. . AVI-7537 is an antisense molecule, essentially a mirror image of a molecule that carries instructions from Ebola’s genes to its protein-making machinery. The drug binds to the messenger, preventing the virus from reproducing. . In previous monkey studies, a combination of antisense molecules proved effective. The new research, published in mBio, found a single one, targeting a messenger for a protein called VP24, was sufficient. . Unlike the 75 percent of Ebola-infected monkeys that survived after receiving AVI-7537 intravenously, all six receiving a placebo of saline solution died. . Demonstrating that a single agent can work is important, said Travis Warren of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, who led the study: It is simpler to manufacture and get regulatory approval for one compound than a combination. . Last November, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Sarepta published research showing that AVI-7537 and another antisense molecule were safe and well-tolerated in all 30 healthy human volunteers. A few experienced mild reactions such as headaches. . Sarepta’s $300 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop drugs against Ebola and the related Marburg virus ended in 2012 due to government funding cuts. The study was completed just before then but not published until the current Ebola outbreak increased interest in the drug, Warren said. . Chief Executive Officer Chris Garabedian said Sarepta would need two years to scale up the manufacturing process for Ebola drugs but would not develop them without government or foundation support.  . Instead, Garabedian said, the company would focus its antisense technology on drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. . Sarepta shares were down 1.4 percent at $12.16 in morning trading. |Tue Feb 10 14:42:55 +0000 2015||Sarepta drug protects lab monkeys from Ebola |5.651589792913408e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fu246N
Misha Hussain|LOLA, Guinea (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Red Cross pickups crawl through the streets of the Guinean town of Lola in search of Ebola victims, crowds of women gather to shoo the medical workers away, young boys throw stones and angry men reach for their machetes. . In the country where West Africa’s Ebola outbreak began, hostility towards aid workers - fueled by ever more far-fetched rumors - is undermining efforts to contain the deadly virus. . “People tell us if we don’t leave they’ll beat us up, or smash up the car,” said Paquile Zoglelemou, head of the Red Cross in Lola, a town set in thick, tropical jungle in the deep southeast of Guinea near the Liberian border. . Concerns about violence directed at aid teams comes as the number of new cases of Ebola rose at the start of February in all three of West Africa’s worst-hit countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - ending previously encouraging declines. . In Lola, a market town with houses of mud brick and tin roofs, a spate of new Ebola cases in recent weeks has stoked fear and mistrust. Despite government efforts to inform people about the virus, false rumors and conspiracy theories win out. . One rumor holds that Western governments have planted the virus, another that spraying of disinfectants is actually a means of infecting others, and even that Ebola treatment centers are used for the extraction and trafficking of human organs. . “The Red Cross wants to kill us,” said Lah Wiemou, an elder in the village of Ouye, near Lola. “They put the virus in the water and spray it around the village, or when they take away the sick, the medication they give them contains Ebola.” . The Ebola epidemic has killed nearly 9,000 people in West Africa over the last year, more than 1,900 of them in Guinea. . Resistance to aid efforts has made it hard to isolate and treat patients, trace their contacts and safely bury the dead, key to preventing another flare up. . “They set up barricades to stop us leaving. Some threw large stones that broke the car windshield, and others ran home to get their machetes,” said Saa Yola Tolno, the top local official in Lola, who accompanied a Red Cross convoy at the weekend. . Some communities still hide their sick and secretly bury their dead, despite high transmission risks during traditional funeral rites, which involve washing and preparing the body. . Forecariah, a town southeast of the capital Conakry, is another hotbed of resistance. Here, Red Cross teams drive unmarked cars, their iconic symbol viewed with suspicion by a fearful population. . Responding to a tip-off via the national Ebola hotline, a team of eight Red Cross workers approaches a man lying motionless under a village water tower. . A slight movement indicates he’s still alive, but barely. . “We’ll take him to the Ebola transit center in Forecariah,” said Alain Kapete, who leads the French Red Cross team in the town. “If he has Ebola, we’ll have to come back and trace everyone that came into contact with him.”  . The team’s presence draws attention. A crowd gathers. . “They spray the virus in the village,” one man says. “That’s why we’re getting sick.” . The dissenter is hushed by the village chief and the team gets to work. They kit up in full protective clothing, lift the man into an ambulance and disinfect the area. . “We now prepare the disinfectant in front of them so they can see we are adding bleach,” said Kapete. . Just the night before, the team had escaped an attack in the town of Sikhourou, near Forecariah, they said. Had it not been for the heavily armed escort of a minister passing through, things could have turned violent. . Attitudes have changed little since the Thomson Reuters Foundation first reported attacks on Ebola health workers 10 months ago in the southeastern town of Macenta. . In Coyah in western Guinea locals attacked aid workers in January when they tried to spray disinfectant around a mosque, said the emergency evacuation service International SOS. . The police used teargas to disperse the crowd, the organization said in a memo to its members. . In Kaback, south of the capital, residents attacked health workers when they tried to add disinfectants to wells, acting on rumors they had come to spread Ebola. The aid workers were badly beaten, said International SOS. . Guinea’s government on Jan. 10 set a 60-day target to completely eradicate the disease, but resistance to containment efforts paints a disturbing picture, say health workers on the ground. . “I think that we should consider ourselves lucky and fortunate if we are able to stop it in 2015,” said Birte Hald, who leads the Ebola unit of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. |Tue Feb 10 13:51:21 +0000 2015||Mistrust and machetes thwart efforts to contain Ebola in Guinea |5.651460014688461e+17|http://reut.rs/1ASXh01
Kate Kelland|Nutrition and health specialists criticized a study on Monday which argued that dietary fat advice given in the United States and Britain was based on flimsy evidence and should not have been introduced. . The study, published in the Open Heart journal, said national advice on fat consumption issued to millions of Britons and Americans in 1977 and 1983 with the aim of reducing heart disease “lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up”. . But in the latest chapter of a long-running row about whether fat is the true culprit in the global obesity epidemic, independent experts said the research was flawed and failed “to take into account the totality of the evidence”. . Both the British and U.S. dietary guidelines recommended reducing overall dietary fat consumption to 30 percent of total intake and limiting saturated fat to around 10 percent — advice that has remained broadly the same since the 1970s and 1980s. . Zoe Harcombe of the University of the West of Scotland and James DiNicolantonio of the Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, who co-led Monday’s study in the Open Heart journal, said their research — a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials available at the time — suggested the guidelines were inconsistent with the evidence. . “The available [trials] did not support the introduction of dietary fat recommendations in order to reduce [coronary heart disease] risk or related mortality,” they wrote, adding that it seemed “incomprehensible” that dietary advice was given to millions of Americans and Britons given the “contrary results”. . Health experts looking for clues to persistently rising obesity rates around the world have recently begun to question whether fat is the main, or only, villain, and many are turning a spotlight on sugars and other carbohydrates instead.     . Yet several independent experts asked to review Harcombe’s and DiNicolantonio’s work criticized the study’s approach and advised extreme caution in concluding the guidelines were wrong. . “The claim that guidelines on dietary fat introduced in the 1970s and 80s were not based on good scientific evidence is misguided and potentially dangerous,” said Christine Williams, a professor of human nutrition at Britain’s Reading University. . Nita Forouhi, a nutritional epidemiology specialist and public health consultant at Britain’s Cambridge University said the Open Heart study’s attempt to apply a “retroscope” to the trial-based evidence of the time was “unhelpful for several reasons, including methodological limitations and interpretation”. . “As such, the current dietary guidelines on fat intake should not be influenced by this study,” she said. |Tue Feb 10 12:55:03 +0000 2015||The fat fight: Study fuels row over UK, U.S. diet guidelines |5.6513183294214554e+17|http://reut.rs/1ASMaUN
Kizito Makoye|TARIME, Tanzania (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a remote, deeply traditional corner of northern Tanzania, growing numbers of girls are running away from home to escape genital mutilation carried out during mass initiations. . In the Tarime district of Mara region, bordering Kenya, the number of girls who fled these illegal rituals at the end of last year doubled to 634 from 312 the year before, according to girls’ rights campaigners. . Teenager Magdalena Lesedi, who narrowly escaped the knife when she ran away during a cutting ceremony at her home village in December, was horrified by what she saw. . “I was very shocked to see blood running down the leg of one of my friends who had just been cut. I couldn’t bear it, I had to run away,” she told Thomson Reuters Foundation. . The 16-year-old said her grandmother had insisted she undergo the ancient ritual to bring her family respect within their community. . “I did not have any idea how it felt to be circumcised until I saw my friend who was very visibly in deep pain,” she said. . Lesedi is among thousands of girls who have sought refuge in recent years at a shelter in the village of Masanga which is fighting to end female genital mutilation (FGM) in Tarime, one of the regions where the practice remains most prevalent. . The refuge is guarded by police to prevent anyone snatching the girls away to mutilate them.  . Up to 7.9 million girls and women in Tanzania are thought to have undergone FGM, which involves the removal of the clitoris and external genitalia. In Tarime, girls are usually cut between the ages of 12 and 17 in initiations performed by circumcisers known as ngariba, often using unclean knives and blades. . The girl is not expected to show any sign of fear throughout the excruciatingly painful ritual which happens amid cheers and ululating from the watching crowd. . Communities who support the practice say it purifies the girl and is a prerequisite for marriage. Kurya clan elders say the cutting is done to curb women’s sexual desire so that they do not stray when their husbands are away. Many Kurya men work as fishermen on Lake Victoria. . Although Tanzania made FGM illegal in 1998 the law is poorly enforced. FGM continues to be practiced by many tribes putting thousands of girls at risk every year. . Internationally condemned as a gross rights abuse, FGM causes a host of serious physical and psychological problems. In extreme cases girls may bleed to death or die from infections, especially if blades are dirty and used on many girls. . Apart from providing a home, the Termination of Female Genital Mutilation (TFGM) center in Masanga teaches girls about reproductive health, the harmful effects of cutting and children’s rights. . “Some of the girls are in a terrible state of mental distress when they come. We sit with them and try to give them psychological counseling and make them feel good,” said the center’s director Sister Germaine Baibika. . Baibika said some girls are even brought to the refuge in secret by their parents to avoid pressure from clan elders and grandmothers during the annual cutting season which runs from November to December. . The center, which is supported by the Children’s Dignity Forum charity and the United Nations Population Fund, also promotes an alternative rite of passage ceremony to replace FGM. . The colorful occasions attract huge numbers from across the Kurya community, including traditional elders. The girls dress up and celebrate with singing and dancing. . As for her future, Lesedi doesn’t think the fact she has refused to be cut will hurt her marriage prospects because she says there is growing recognition that FGM is bad. . Women’s rights groups say the number of girls being cut is falling every year. “I think people realize FGM brings nothing other than pain and suffering to innocent girls,” said Valerie Msoka, head of women’s rights organization Tamwa. . However campaigners say it is not enough to show communities that FGM is harmful. The ngariba earn money from each girl they cut so they need to have an alternative income source or they will not lay down their knives. The Masanga center is training them in skills such as batik-making. . Maria Wekwe, a 51-year-old grandmother, said she had secretly cut hundreds of girls during nearly 20 years as a ngariba, charging parents 15,000 shillings ($8) for each girl and cutting at least 32 girls a season. . “I inherited this job from my grandmother, but I have decided to wash my hands of it because I realize that I have caused a lot of pain and suffering to so many people,” she said. |Tue Feb 10 11:31:39 +0000 2015||Hundreds of Tanzanian girls run away from home to avoid FGM |5.651108454334546e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ftjroj
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Global health charity Medecins du Monde (MdM) launched a legal challenge on Tuesday to a European patent held by U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc which it accused of charging “exorbitant” prices for a hepatitis C drug. . Arguing that Gilead is “abusing” its patent on Sovaldi, known generically as sofosbuvir, MdM said its challenge marked the first time in Europe a medical charity has used this method to try and improve patients’ access to medicines. . “While using sofosbuvir to treat hepatitis C represents a major therapeutic advance, the molecule itself, which is the result of work by many public and private researchers, is not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent,” MdM said in a statement. . “As Gilead is abusing its patent to impose prices which are unsustainable for healthcare systems, (MdM) has decided to contest it.” . A Gilead spokeswoman said the firm had no comment at this time. . According to World Health Organization data, as many as 150 million people worldwide live with chronic hepatitis C infection, most of them in low and middle-income countries. In the European Union, between 7.3 and 8.8 million people are believed to be infected with hepatitis C. . Sovaldi is a so-called nucleotide analog inhibitor which blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate.  . Gilead has previously argued Sovaldi’s high price is justified by its near guarantee of a cure, far fewer side effects and its ability to help patients avoid expensive hospital treatment, including potential liver transplants. . But the sheer cost of the drug - which sold $5.8 billion in its first six months, making it the most successful new drug launch ever - has fueled controversy. . MdM said the cost of the medicine in Britain, some 33,000 pounds ($50,160) for a 12-week treatment, was an “exorbitant price” which hinders many people’s access to the drug.  . It said that if successful, its legal challenge could allow competition from generic versions of the drug which it said could be produced for as little as 66 pounds. . Jean-François Corty, MdM’s French programs director said the charity was defending universal access to healthcare. . “The struggle against health inequality involves safeguarding a healthcare system based on solidarity,” he said in a statement.  . “Even in a ‘rich’ country such as France, with an annual drugs budget of 27 billion euros, it’s hard to meet this cost and already we’re seeing an arbitrary rationing approach that excludes patients from care.” |Tue Feb 10 10:19:40 +0000 2015||Gilead faces challenge to European patent on pricey hep C drug |5.65092730213503e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ft5U0a
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For the first time in 20 years, patients suffering from the eye disease glaucoma may soon have new treatments as several young companies look to shake up the $5.6 billion global market . There is no cure for glaucoma, which damages the optic nerve and is expected to affect more than 4 million Americans by 2030, up from 2.7 million today. But treatments help patients manage the disease and may prevent the onset of blindness. . The new treatments promise to improve outcomes and reduce side-effects associated with current medicines, exploiting a long dearth of innovative new products for the disease. No new class of medicine has been introduced since Pfizer Inc’s Xalatan, known generically as latanoprost, in 1996. . The newcomers aim to disrupt market-leaders Alcon, a division of Novartis AG, Allergan Inc, Pfizer and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. . Leading the pack is Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc, which plans to launch its novel eye-drop Rhopressa in 2017 and another treatment, Roclatan, a year later. The company sold 6.7 million shares for $10 each in its 2013 market debut. They now top $26. . Following Aerie is Inotek Pharmaceuticals, whose trabodenoson eye-drop is entering late-stage trials expected to be completed by 2017. Inotek has announced plans to sell 4.6 million shares at between $13 and $15 each in an IPO expected soon. . Drugs to combat glaucoma, the second-leading cause of blindness in the world, work by reducing pressure inside the eye. Aerie and Inotek’s drugs are the first to target the trabecular network, the main drain through which fluid flows out of the eye, though they do so in different ways. . Taking a different approach is Ocular Therapeutix Inc, which is developing a tiny device that can be inserted into the eye to deliver regular medication. The product is in mid-stage clinical trials. Ocular’s shares have risen to more than $30 from their IPO price of $13 last year.  . “There’s a new graduating class of next-generation treatments,” said William Slattery, partner at Deerfield Management Company L.P., which holds shares in Aerie and recently provided the company with $125 million in financing. . Prostaglandins are the most widely-prescribed glaucoma drugs. They include latanoprost, Alcon’s Travatan, and Allergan’s Lumigan. But prostaglandins can cause eye redness and changes to eye pigmentation and eyelash length. Most patients need extra therapies such as timolol, a decades-old beta-blocker that lowers eye pressure but can slow a patient’s heart beat. . Rhopressa and trabodenoson work differently. They do not cause changes to eye pigmentation or lash length, though Rhopressa can still cause red eye. Experts say even incremental improvements in treatments would be welcome. . “We continue to have people who are going blind from glaucoma and that’s a problem,” said Dr. Wiley Chambers, deputy director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s transplant and ophthalmology products. “We need alternatives.” . So far, analysts are betting that Aerie’s second drug, Roclatan, will be the most effective at lowering eye pressure. It is a fixed-dose combination product that includes Rhopressa and latanoprost. Both those constituents cause red eye, however. . Inotek’s trabodenoson does not appear to cause red eye, making it a potentially attractive product for physicians to prescribe as an add-on therapy. The company is also testing it in a fixed dose combination with latanoprost. . Vicente Anido Jr., Aerie’s chief executive, predicts that  Rhopressa and Roclatan could generate $1 billion apiece worldwide a year. “We think we could end up being the next Allergan or Alcon,” he said.  . Some analysts agree with Anido’s projections, and say that Aerie could become a takeover target if late-stage clinical trial data to be released mid-year are positive. . But Catherine Daly, a neurology and ophthalmology analyst at research and consulting firm GlobalData Healthcare, thinks Aerie’s projections are too high. She sees combined sales closer to $600 million.  . “It’s going to take a lot to move people away from using prostaglandins, which have a long track record,” she said. . Daly predicts sales of trabodenoson will be less than half those of Rhopressa and Roclatan, in part because Aerie is projected to reach the market first. In addition, Aerie’s drugs may work in a broader patient population, including those whose eye pressure is normal but are still losing vision. . Inotek, which last year hired long-time biotech executive  . David Southwell as its chief executive, has received less attention than Aerie. That could change after the company goes public. Southwell is a former investment banker and canny dealmaker. As chief financial officer at Human Genome Sciences he oversaw that company’s $3 billion sale to GlaxoSmithKline Plc in 2012.  . The wave of innovation comes as big drugmakers are getting out of eye-care or consolidating.  . The most innovative of the big company products appears to be Bausch & Lomb’s Vesneo, which represents an advance on existing therapies and could be on the market by next year. It combines latanoprost with nitric oxide to add an extra pressure-lowering boost. The company has said the drug could generate $500 million in u.s. sales and $1 billion globally. . Alcon, whose glaucoma treatment revenues stood at $1.3 billion last year, said it was “evaluating external partnerships” for access to new glaucoma technologies.  . Firms are also working on new drug delivery mechanisms. Allergan’s bimatoprost SR is in late-stage clinical trials and could become the first long-acting implant to reach the market. Still, it faces competition from several small firms including Ocular Therapeutix, pSivida and Mati Therapeutics. . “By using their own proprietary delivery platforms with other prostaglandin drugs they could become major competitors to Allergan in the future,” Daly said. |Tue Feb 10 06:32:12 +0000 2015||New wave of drugs poised to shake up glaucoma treatment |5.6503548675516826e+17|http://reut.rs/1FsuZrU
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California health officials on Monday warned parents against intentionally exposing their children to measles, which could worsen an outbreak in the state. . In response to media inquiries about so-called measles parties, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) said it did not have information on the parties or their frequency. . But it added that the disease, of which 107 cases have been confirmed since an outbreak began late last year, was serious. . “CDPH strongly recommends against the intentional exposure of children to measles as it unnecessarily places the exposed children at potentially grave risk and could contribute to further spread,” said department spokeswoman Anita Gore. . In 2011, federal authorities issued stern warnings following media reports that vaccine-wary parents were trading chicken pox-laced lollipops by mail, in misguided efforts to build children’s immunity through exposure to the virus. . More than a third of California’s cases have been linked to an outbreak health officials believe began in the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim in December. Gore said 30 percent of people infected in the current outbreak have been hospitalized. . More than 36 additional cases of the highly infectious disease have been reported in 19 other states and in Mexico, including three new cases diagnosed in Cook County, Illinois. Seven of the eight cases so far found in Cook County are associated with a daycare center in the city of Palatine. . Georgia health officials reported that an infant arriving in Atlanta from outside the United States was confirmed to have measles, the state’s first reported case of the disease since 2012. The Georgia case is unrelated to the California outbreak. . The California Department of Public Health says 39 of the  107 confirmed cases have been linked to the Disneyland cluster. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to refuse inoculations for their children. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons.  . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year, it had its highest number of measles cases in 20 years. . Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. |Tue Feb 10 02:38:21 +0000 2015||California confirms 107 cases of measles, 39 from Disneyland outbreak |5.649766372852449e+17|http://reut.rs/1ARc8Ie
David Beasley|ATLANTA (Reuters) - An infant in Georgia has been diagnosed with measles, marking the state’s first reported case of the disease since 2012, health officials said on Monday. . The Georgia case is unrelated to a California outbreak that originated with a person from outside the United States who visited the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim in late December, Georgia health officials said on Monday.   . Some 121 people in California and 16 other states have been diagnosed with measles this year as of Friday, with 85 percent of the cases linked to the Disneyland outbreak, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  . In the Georgia case, the patient arrived in Atlanta from outside the United States and is being treated at a local hospital, health officials said.  . State health officials are working with the CDC to identify anyone who may have been exposed to measles from the infant, the Georgia Department of Public Health said. . Since 2002, there have been a total of 11 measles cases in Georgia, all of them to originating abroad or linked to overseas cases, health officials said. |Tue Feb 10 00:30:00 +0000 2015||Infant in Georgia diagnosed with measles |5.649443344964854e+17|http://reut.rs/1AQM3sK
Nivedita Bhattacharjee|MUMBAI (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is cutting the amount of calories and salt on its Indian menu as it fights to hold on to customers in a rapidly growing developing market where newer, healthier fast-food options are just starting to catch on. . The burger chain is known globally for the consistency of its food, down to the thickness of fries or the amount of cheese on burgers, and changes run the risk of upsetting customers who expect the same taste on every visit, everywhere. . Amit Jatia, vice president of one of India’s two main McDonald’s franchisees, said that changes to reduce sodium and calories in fries, buns and sauces had been done gradually, and were subtle enough to keep taste consistent and customers happy. McDonald’s has not talked about these changes previously. . “It wasn’t as if we suddenly cut the salt in our foods one day. Our menu and sourcing teams have been working to make slight alterations for months now,” Jatia told Reuters in an interview. . McDonald’s in India has cut sodium in its sauces and buns by 10 percent and in fries by 20 percent, Jatia said. Calories in sauces are down by 30-40 percent over the last six months. . Loyalists interviewed in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai said they did not detect any difference in taste. . “I order in from McD’s at least twice a month and think it tastes pretty much the same,” said Rahul Dutta, 29, a marketing executive based in New Delhi.  . Jatia heads the south and western McDonald’s franchisees in India, running 202 stores and 30 cafes. Another group controls the north and east, with 166 restaurants. . Rising levels of obesity, once just a problem of rich nations that the World Health Organisation says is increasingly affecting low and middle-income countries, has put pressure on fast food chain’s globally to offer healthier food.  . In a recent corporate social responsibility report, McDonald’s said that by 2020 it aimed to offer sides of salads, fruit or vegetables as a substitute for fries in its value meals in 20 major markets. . The reduction of salt in fries, buns and nuggets was part of a global push to reduce sodium levels in its food, McDonald’s said, while the reduction of oils in sauces was a local initiative in India. The changes have reduced the calorie impact of a burger by 7-8 percent, it said. . The chain trimmed salt in fries at its British restaurants in 2006. . Some analysts think this is the chain’s way of getting out ahead of a looming burger war in India. . In its bigger markets like the United States, McDonald’s is losing customers to chains like Panera Bread or Chipotle Mexican Grill, which are seen as selling food with fresher ingredients. . That was part of the reason behind an abrupt management change at McDonald’s last month, when CEO Don Thompson left after three years on the job. . In India, where obesity is a growing problem and incidence of diabetes is rising rapidly, more international chains are moving in to challenge McDonald’s dominance. . Burger King [BKCBK.UL], Carl’s Junior, Johnny Rockets and Wendy’s [WEN.UL] have announced plans or already set up shop, posing stiffer competition to McDonald’s and Yum Brand’s KFC, which gave been around for about a decade. . Technopak predicts the industry will be worth 490 billion rupees ($7.92 billion) by 2020, up from 154.4 billion rupees ($2.50 billion) last year. . Like rival Yum Brands, McDonald’s has made changes to its traditional menu to suit cultural norms in the majority Hindu  country, steering clear of beef and pork while offering vegetarian sandwiches and egg-free mayonnaise. . India accounts for a small portion of McDonald’s global sales of $27.4 billion, but is among its fastest growing markets. Jatia said the aim was to open as many as 250 stores in the next three to five years. . Analyst Sushmul Maheswari of business and consultancy firm RNCOS said the India unit has been growing at 11 percent over the past three years, and part of its success was down to consistency. . “McDonald’s burger and fries are popular because they have that peculiar taste that is available only with them,” he said. “They cannot tinker with that, even if they are healthy tweaks.” . ($1 = 61.8460 Indian rupees) .

Kate Kelland|Nutrition and health specialists criticised a study on Monday which argued that dietary fat advice given in the United States and Britain was based on flimsy evidence and should not have been introduced. . The study, published in the Open Heart journal, said national advice on fat consumption issued to millions of Britons and Americans in 1977 and 1983 with the aim of reducing heart disease “lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up”. . But in the latest chapter of a long-running row about whether fat is the true culprit in the global obesity epidemic, independent experts said the research was flawed and failed “to take into account the totality of the evidence”. . Both the British and U.S. dietary guidelines recommended reducing overall dietary fat consumption to 30 percent of total intake and limiting saturated fat to around 10 percent — advice that has remained broadly the same since the 1970s and 1980s. . Zoe Harcombe of the University of the West of Scotland and James DiNicolantonio of the Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, who co-led Monday’s study in the Open Heart journal, said their research — a meta-analysis of the randomised controlled trials available at the time — suggested the guidelines were inconsistent with the evidence. . “The available [trials] did not support the introduction of dietary fat recommendations in order to reduce [coronary heart disease] risk or related mortality,” they wrote, adding that it seemed “incomprehensible” that dietary advice was given to millions of Americans and Britons given the “contrary results”. . Health experts looking for clues to persistently rising obesity rates around the world have recently begun to question whether fat is the main, or only, villain, and many are turning a spotlight on sugars and other carbohydrates instead.     . Yet several independent experts asked to review Harcombe’s and DiNicolantonio’s work criticised the study’s approach and advised extreme caution in concluding the guidelines were wrong. . “The claim that guidelines on dietary fat introduced in the 1970s and 80s were not based on good scientific evidence is misguided and potentially dangerous,” said Christine Williams, a professor of human nutrition at Britain’s Reading University. . Nita Forouhi, a nutritional epidemiology specialist and public health consultant at Britain’s Cambridge University said the Open Heart study’s attempt to apply a “retroscope” to the trial-based evidence of the time was “unhelpful for several reasons, including methodological limitations and interpretation”. . “As such, the current dietary guidelines on fat intake should not be influenced by this study,” she said. |Mon Feb 09 23:51:43 +0000 2015||The fat fight: Study fuels row over UK, U.S. diet guidelines |5.6493469960555725e+17|http://reut.rs/1AQE675
Kathryn Doyle|Young women report more stress than men soon after a heart attack, which may explain their worse recovery, according to a new study. . “It has been known for a while that (the) mortality rate is higher in younger women than in younger men after heart attack,” said lead author Xiao Xu, assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. . But few studies have looked at gender differences in other outcomes, Xu told Reuters Health by email.  . “Women tend to experience greater stress than men, even in the general population regardless of heart attack status,” she said. “Our study confirmed such a gender difference in young and middle-aged patients with heart attack.” . The researchers compared 2,397 women and 1,175 men under age 55 who were hospitalized in the U.S., Spain or Australia with a heart attack.  The severity of the heart attacks was similar for women and men. . While hospitalized, participants answered 14 questions about their recent stress levels. One month later, researchers re-interviewed them and assessed their recovery. . At the first interview, those who were younger and female tended to have higher stress scores than those who were older or male, the authors reported in a paper scheduled for publication in the journal Circulation. On the 0- to 56-point stress scale, men averaged 23.4 points and women averaged 27 points. . A third of women had experienced major family conflict within the past year compared to 20 percent of men. More women than men also reported a major personal injury, illness or death of a family member over the past year. . Women tend to have lower financial resources than men and are often faced with more demands for family care, which may explain their higher stress, Xu said. . Women in the study also had more diabetes, lung disease, kidney problems, depression, cancer and previous heart problems. . At the one-month point, women had worse chest-pain related physical function, quality of life and overall health. . “We had known that women have worse health status after a heart attack for some time,” said Dr. Suzanne V. Arnold, a research assistant professor at the University of Missouri in Kansas City. “What we don’t really understand is why.” . Arnold, who was not involved in the new study, noted that people who have more issues with their health and personal lives also experience more stress, and in this study, the women tended to have more of both. . Stress is associated with heart attack and even death, Arnold said. . “However, stress is associated with so many other things – including smoking, lack of exercise, comorbidities, etc. – that are also strong risk factors for heart attack,” so stress was probably not the main cause of most of the heart attacks, she said.  . After a heart attack, patients are often advised to adopt healthy lifestyles and receive therapies such as beta-blockers, but people under more stress may be less likely to comply, Xu said.  . Stressed people are more likely to engage in smoking and drinking behaviors or have disruptions in their treatment regimen, she said.  . “When caring for younger patients with heart attack, especially younger women patients, we should look beyond their physical health and pay attention to their psychosocial status as well,” Xu said.  . “Although our study demonstrated a strong relationship between higher mental stress and worse recovery, we cannot make causal inferences,” she said. “We still need more research to understand the exact mechanisms through which mental stress operates to affect recovery.” . All heart attack patients, regardless of gender, should be screened for chronic stress, Arnold said. . “I think this research highlights again the importance of recognizing and addressing the level of perceived stress of heart attack patients,” she said. “I don’t think men or women should be treated differently, as any ‘intervention’ for stress would need to be customized for the individual patient and his or her psychosocial needs.” .

Daniel Gaitan|With cold and flu season in full swing, experts are warning men who have an enlarged prostate to avoid medicines containing antihistamines and decongestants. . “It’s very important that men with enlarged prostate avoid cold medicines with pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. Those are ingredients in decongestants and they constrict the prostatic capsule” and lead to urine retention, said Dr. Gregory T. Bales, a urologist at the University of Chicago Medical Center. “Antihistamines aren’t quite as bad, because they work more on the bladder muscle, but they can cause bladder contractility.” . Enlargement of the prostate, formally known as benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), results from increased cell growth in and around the prostate gland. The increased growth can constrict the urethra (the tube that carries urine out from the bladder) and decrease urine flow. Men with the progressive disease often have difficulty urinating and the urge to go more frequently. . BPH is more common in older men, because as men age their prostate continues to grow. Nearly 80 percent of men age 50 and older will be diagnosed with some degree of the disease, said Dr. William Catalona, a urologist with Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. . “We don’t know what causes benign prostatic enlargement, it’s one of the great mysteries, and we really wish we did because it’s such a prevalent condition,” Catalona told Reuters Health. “Sometimes men need to get up every hour at night.” . Bales has treated hundreds of patients struggling with BPH, and he warns against waiting too long to visit a doctor during complete retention. Severe retention can cause kidney damage and other serious issues.  . “If a man is already having a little difficulty and his stream is already slow, and then you (make it worse) it by adding one of these medicines, it’s the recipe for causing retention. All it takes is one dose,” Bales told Reuters Health. “If you haven’t urinated in six hours or so, you have to go to the hospital and get a catheter put in to drain that liquid. Then we wait a couple days to let the medicine get out of his system and then do a urine test. It’s painful.” . Cold remedies that are inhaled, such as a nasal corticosteroid, will not have the same side effects as an oral agent, Bales added. Mentholated ointments are a safer alternative to decongestants. . “If men notice problems with urination after taking certain medicines, they may need to weigh the risks and benefits,” Dr. Dan R. Gralnek, a urologist with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, told Reuters Health. Nearly 15 percent of his patients have complications associated with BPH. . Dr. Matthew Johnson, a urologist with Aurora Health Care in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, urges men to carefully read over-the-counter drug labels. . “You have to be aware of what a medication’s potential side-effects are. Unfortunately, the package insert for most medications is quite lengthy,” he told Reuters Health. “Men need to have a relationship with a provider who can monitor these things and individualize their care.”|Mon Feb 09 21:34:42 +0000 2015||Men with prostate trouble should avoid some cold medicines |5.649002195787448e+17|http://reut.rs/1AQ5yBG
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Monday that 2015 Obamacare subsidies are averaging $268 a month for people in 37 states who have qualified for federal assistance to help with premiums through the website, HealthCare.gov. . An administration statement, released less than a week before the Feb. 15 close of open enrollment for private health coverage, said subsidies had reduced average monthly premiums to $105 as of Jan. 30, for 6.5 million people who qualified through the federal website.  . About eight out of 10 people who chose health plans had premiums of $100 or less after subsidies, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said. Without subsidies, average Obamacare premiums available through HealthCare.gov stand at $374 a month. . The subsidies now available through HealthCare.gov are the subject of a looming U.S. Supreme Court case, in which the plaintiffs hope to prevent people enrolled through the federal exchange from obtaining assistance.  . HHS says that about 7.5 million Americans have signed up for 2015 health coverage through the federal exchange so far.  |Mon Feb 09 20:58:38 +0000 2015||U.S. government says Obamacare subsidies averaging $268 a month |5.648911437927588e+17|http://reut.rs/1APVuZD

|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The state of Pennsylvania has launched an expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program, governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said in a statement on Monday.  . “Today is the first step toward simplifying a complicated process and ensuring hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians have greater access to the health insurance they need,” said Wolf, who ousted Republican Governor Tom Corbett in November’s election. . The plan replaces Corbett’s Healthy PA initiative, according to the statement. Healthy PA was announced in August to use federal funds to pay for private health insurance coverage for up to 600,000 residents.   . Corbett had been one of a number of Republican governors who found ways to accept money under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, despite political opposition that has so far prevented a number of U.S. states from moving forward with the Medicaid expansion plan. . States run Medicaid, which serves families who have low incomes, and receive partial reimbursements from the federal government. The healthcare overhaul known as Obamacare allowed more people to enroll in Medicaid and also gave states 90 percent to 100 percent reimbursements for new enrollees.   |Mon Feb 09 19:35:33 +0000 2015||Pennsylvania launches Medicaid expansion: governor Tom Wolf |5.6487023556899635e+17|http://reut.rs/1FqHZyp
|SEATTLE (Reuters) - An outbreak of mumps that started at an Idaho university and infected 21 people across the state has now spread to neighboring Washington state, health officials said on Monday. . The spread of mumps, a highly contagious virus that leads to painful swelling of the salivary glands, comes as a wider measles outbreak has infected more than 100 people in California and over a dozen more in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico since December. . The mumps outbreak began in September at the University of Idaho campus in Moscow, near the border with Washington state, and later spread to the capital, Boise, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said.  . Mumps, which leads to painful swelling of the salivary glands, spreads easily from sharing saliva through kissing, shared eating utensils or water bottles, public health officials said. . So far, there have been 21 confirmed and probable cases, including six around Boise, the state’s most populous city, a statement said. Then on Friday, two infections were reported in Washington state, the statement added. . Public health officials were urging students on the Moscow campus and anyone who might have come into close contact with an infected person to ensure their vaccinations are up to date. Mumps and measles can be prevented through a single vaccine, the MMR vaccine that also covers rubella, health officials said.  . “The MMR vaccine will also protect against measles, which is increasing in the western U.S. because of a large outbreak linked to an amusement park in California,” the Idaho health agency said in a statement. . The measles outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which a small minority of parents have chosen not to immunize their children over fear of potential side-effects fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism. Federal health officials have urged parents to get their children vaccinated. |Mon Feb 09 19:35:33 +0000 2015||Mumps outbreak linked to Idaho university spreads to Washington state |5.6487023381161574e+17|http://reut.rs/1FqHZyr
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . When U.S. health regulators find serious problems with how medical researchers collect their data, the researchers’ final reports often don’t mention it, a new analysis suggests. . Out of 78 published papers reporting on clinical trials in which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found very serious issues, only three mentioned any violations, the new report says.  . “These are major things,” said Charles Seife, a journalism professor and the study’s author.  . Using documents and data from 1998 to 2013, Seife and his students at New York University in New York City identified 57 clinical trials that received an “official action indicated” violation - the most serious type of violation for trials - for reasons including poor recordkeeping, false information and poor patient safety. . Among the 78 published analyses of data from these sanctioned trials, only three noted the violations, which included researchers falsifying the data and patients being included in the trial even though they weren’t eligible for it. . The problems that weren’t reported were sometimes egregious. One paper, for example, said all patients reported improvement, but in fact, the FDA found that one patient had a foot amputated two weeks after receiving the treatment.   . In another case, the entire clinical trial was considered unreliable by the FDA - but the published paper didn’t mention that.  . In another, researchers falsified data, which led to one patient’s death. . Data on these violations are not readily available. So it’s impossible to say how often tainted data are published and how often the violations are noted, Seife said. . “No one really knows unless you go through these documents that anyone is questioning the integrity of the trials,” he said. . Doctors, he added, would want to know if the FDA found serious problems with data collection, since they’ll be using that data to decide which medication is best for their patients. . Similarly, he said, editors of medical journals should be concerned because the violations may undermine the credibility of the information they publish. . “This study highlights some disturbing examples where articles were published and information was lacking and this would be a concern to readers,” said Dr. Robert Steinbrook, an editor at large at JAMA Internal Medicine who co-authored an editorial published with Seife’s report. . “What this does is call attention to a communication issue,” said Steinbrook, who is also affiliated with the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. . While he said communication with the FDA improved on such issues, “our suggestion is to go further.” . For example, both his editorial and the study suggest that clinical trial inspection reports be attached to the U.S. government’s database at ClinicalTrials.gov. . In a statement to Reuters Health, the FDA said it “. . . is committed to increasing the transparency of compliance and enforcement activities with the goal of enhancing the public’s understanding of the FDA’s decisions, promoting the accountability of the FDA, and fostering an understanding among regulated industry about the need for consistently safe and high-quality products.” . Seife agrees that there’s been movement toward more transparency, but he says there is still a lot to be done. . “I’m not sure you’ll ever get traction until there’s some incentive behind it,” he said. .

|LONDON (Reuters) - A British biotech company founded by a Nobel prize winner has raised what it says is a record 691,000 pounds ($1 million) via crowdfunding to help launch a stem cell-based regenerative medicine for use following heart trauma. . Cell Therapy, based in the Welsh capital Cardiff, says the medicine has the potential to reduce scarring of the heart muscle caused by a heart attack or failure. . Chief Executive Ajan Reginald, previously at Roche, said crowd funding was a quick way to raise money for final stage trials or commercial launches. . “It was very fast and very efficient,” he told Reuters on Monday. “We have spent 5 percent of our time on fundraising, which enables me to spend 95 percent of my time on the business.” . The company, whose founder Martin Evans shared the 2007 Nobel Prize for medicine for groundbreaking stem cell research, used website Crowdcube to raise nearly three times its original target from more than 300 investors. . Reginald said the backers included investment bankers, hedge fund employees and scientists. . “Crowd funding allows investors to look in detail at a company in their own time,” he said, adding that some 10,000 investors had seen the pitch. . The company would publish data from clinical trials of the drug, called Heartcel, next month, before final stage trials with a view to a launch in 2016. |Mon Feb 09 16:52:48 +0000 2015||British biotech firm sets crowdfunding record with heart drug |5.648292784714834e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fq9x6U
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – Counter to the fears of some parents (and a few doctors), teen girls who are vaccinated against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) do not go on to catch more sexually transmitted diseases than their peers, according to a large new study. . Some parents have been hesitant to have their teens vaccinated for fear that they would be emboldened to have more, and riskier, sex – the kind that can put them at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). . The HPV vaccine has been available in the U.S. since 2006 and is recommended for all preteen boys and girls at age 11 or 12, so they have time to develop an immune response before becoming sexually active. But by 2013, less than 40 percent of U.S. girls age 13 to 17 had received all three doses of the vaccine, the authors of the new study point out.  . Using the rate of STDs as an indicator of risky sexual behavior, there doesn’t appear to be a connection with the vaccine, researchers say. . “The vast majority of parents don’t think this is an issue,” said Dr. Anupam B. Jena, who’s with the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School in Boston.  “But 10 to 20 percent of parents and at least some pediatricians think that this could be an issue.”  . The recommended three doses of the vaccine protect against the two strains of HPV responsible for most cervical, anal and vaginal cancers. But even with the most recent data, less than half of teens have gotten the full three-shot series, Jena told Reuters Health by phone. . He and his co-authors analyzed insurance data on more than 200,000 teen girls from 2005 to 2010. Less than three percent had received the vaccine by the end of 2006, which increased to more than 25 percent by 2010. . In the year before they were vaccinated, about four of every 1,000 girls experienced a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, human immunodeficiency virus or syphilis. Among girls who weren’t vaccinated, about three of every 1,000 had contracted one of these infections in the past year.  . But over the following year, STDs became more common for both groups of girls, rising to more than six of every 1,000 vaccinated teens and more than four of every 1,000 unvaccinated teens, according to results in JAMA Internal Medicine.  . Because rates of these infections increased in both groups as the girls got older, the HPV vaccine was not tied to any extra increase in STDs, the authors write. Those who were vaccinated may have started having sex earlier, which led to their parents or doctors recommending the vaccine, and which would explain the higher STD rate before and after the shots, they write. . Quite a bit of research has been done on the potential ‘behavioral compensation’ that may follow sex education, free condom programs, or other safe-sex interventions, and it seems from most of the studies like these efforts do not lead to riskier sexual behavior, Jena said. . Still, “it’s not an unreasonable concern for parents or policymakers to have,” he said. “That’s why you need studies like this.” . Hopefully, the results of this very large study of U.S. girls will dispel some of those concerns, he said. . Some people have been uneasy with the idea of recommending an STD vaccine for kids as young as 11 or 12, according to Robert A. Bednarczyk of Emory University in Atlanta, who wrote a commentary in the journal. . “They mention not feeling comfortable talking about sex with an 11 year old,” Bednarczyk told Reuters Health by phone. “But if you’re giving a tetanus and diphtheria shot, are you going into extended discussions about transmission?” . Eleven and 12 year olds are already coming to the doctor for a round of routine vaccinations including a tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) booster and a vaccine against bacterial meningitis, so it makes sense to start the HPV series at the same time, he said. . “If you give the vaccine at an earlier age it provides a higher level of antibodies,” Bednarczyk said. .

Sybille de La Hamaide|PARIS (Reuters) - Canada reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus in the province of British Columbia, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday. . The outbreak was detected on Feb. 2 in a backyard poultry flock in the province, where bird flu cases of the separate H5N2 strain had been reported in December, OIE said, citing the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). . The agency stressed that H5N1 avian influenza had not been reported in a commercial poultry flock in Canada and that the virus found in British Columbia was different from a strain circulating in Asia. No human infections have been reported with the H5N1 virus detected in Canada, unlike the genetically different Asian strain, an OIE spokeswoman said. . H5N1 bird flu, which first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong, has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths. . “Based on the limited partial sequence of the H5 and N1 gene segments obtained this far, it appears very likely that this is the same or a very similar virus to the ... H5N1 virus in Washington state, but more sequencing will be needed to make a final conclusion,” the CFIA said in its report. . The agency said it could not immediately comment. . The H5N1 strain of bird flu was found earlier this year on a green-winged teal in Washington near the border with Canada. |Mon Feb 09 15:47:27 +0000 2015||Canada reports H5N1 bird flu virus in British Columbia: OIE |5.648128324251443e+17|http://reut.rs/1FpWtOP
|DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is to get a $300-million loan from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) to help improve child nutrition after a deal was signed on Monday. . The project will provide financial help to about 600,000 of the country’s poorest mothers. . “The project will help poor mothers learn how to improve the nutrition of their young children and also provide an income supplement to enable them to better act on that learning,” said Johannes Zutt, the World Bank’s country director for Bangladesh. . Despite Bangladesh’s record of reducing child mortality, it remains among the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of malnutrition and 41 percent of children below the age of 5 have stunted growth, according to the World Health Organization. . The project will cover 42 of the poorest sub-districts in northern Bangladesh that lag behind in nutrition indicators and is expected to benefit 2.7 million people. . “The project will break the cycle that binds poor children to poor nutrition and cognitive deficiencies,” said Mohammad Mejbahuddin, senior secretary in the Finance Ministry. . The IDA credit has a 38-year term, including a 6-year grace period, and a service charge of 0.75 percent.  |Mon Feb 09 14:53:23 +0000 2015||Bangladesh to get $300-million World Bank loan for child health |5.6479922538573005e+17|http://reut.rs/1AOk4K8
Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Whether the request was for a treadmill on Air Force One, an elliptical trainer by the White House pool, or a rower adjacent the Lincoln bedroom, when the Oval Office called, fitness trainer Ted Vickey answered.  . As the former executive director of the White House Athletic Center during the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Vickey served their fitness demands. . While their styles differed, Vickey said each president made fitness a priority. . “Both Clinton and Bush were big outdoor runners but Clinton would also like to run outside the gates, talking to people,” Vickey recalled. “Bush was a more private exerciser; the elder Bush enjoyed speed golf.” . Although the presidents didn’t use the Athletic Center, which was built for staffers in 1987 under the Reagan Administration, Vickey was familiar with their fitness routines. . Bush used exercise as a way to manage his day, said Vickey, who installed a folding treadmill on Air Force One so the 43rd president could work out on a trip to Colombia. . Vickey also converted a room near the Lincoln bedroom into a fitness center. . “One day the Oval Office called: ‘We need you to get us a bike, elliptical and rower, delivered to West Wing and we want it tomorrow,’” Vickey said. . During Bush’s tenure the size of the member-supported White House Athletic Center doubled to over 8000 square feet. Bush encouraged his staffers to work out during their day.  . “Center membership increased during his term,” Vickey said.  . Jessica Matthews, senior health and fitness expert for the American Council on Exercise, said the presidents were wise because research has shown the benefits of exercise for people in high-stress positions, from increasing productivity to avoiding depression and burn out. . “Pilot studies have pointed to reduced stress levels after even a single bout of exercise,” she said. . Vickey, who left the White House in 2005, believes fitness is still a priority for the president. . “I know President Barack Obama is big on basketball,” he said. “He’s obviously a golfer and I know he brought his personal trainer with him from Chicago.” . Now based in California and the head of FitWell LLC, a corporate fitness management company, Vickey said presidents set an example for others to follow. . “If the president of the United States can find an hour in the day to work out, what’s our excuse?” he added.  |Mon Feb 09 13:43:47 +0000 2015||Styles differ but U.S. presidents make fitness a priority |5.647817089026949e+17|http://reut.rs/1FpzvaG
Emma Batha|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Soccer legend David Beckham pledged to change the lives of millions of children on Monday as he launched “7”, a new fund with UNICEF to protect the world’s most vulnerable youngsters. . “Over the coming years I am going to work with UNICEF to raise millions and speak out for children all over the world,” said Beckham. . The fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — will focus on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.  . “Today, the need to help children has never been greater and since retiring I have more time and I want to do so much more,” said Beckham, who is marking 10 years as a good will ambassador for the U.N. Children’s Fund. . “Everything I have done, my soccer career, my family, has led to this point – this is the moment for me to do what I can to help children in every corner of the world. This is something I want my own children to be proud of,” added Beckham, a father of four. . Beckham also asked his fans to back his call to world leaders to put children first as they negotiate new global development goals. . The launch of “7” comes after one of the worst years for children on record, UNICEF said.   . More than 15 million children were exposed to extreme violence in conflicts in 2014 and millions more were hit by natural disasters. . The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has also left thousands orphaned and many more out of school. . Worldwide, some 168 million children are engaged in child labor and many others are victims of sexual violence, trafficking and female genital mutilation, UNICEF said.  |Mon Feb 09 12:49:41 +0000 2015||Beckham launches '7' fund for kids in danger around the world |5.647680970607903e+17|http://reut.rs/1ANRzMJ
Laila Kearney|DOWNINGTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - The desperate cry of a mother finding her 17-year-old son dead from a painkiller and another prescription drug instantly silences hundreds of Pennsylvania high school students who listen to her 911 call played at an early morning assembly. . That recording, played as the roughly 500 students look at an urn holding the dead boy’s ashes and photos of dozens of other teens who died of overdoses, is the gut-punch that anchors a new educational program aimed at combating the rising abuse of prescription opioid abuse among U.S. young adults. . “All these kids were around our age, said Michael Senn, an 18-year-old senior at the school Downingtown High School East, after the program. “It felt personal.” . Senn and his classmates had just sat through a presentation by Narcotics Overdose Prevention and Education, or NOPE, one of a handful of prevention programs cropping up around the United States offering high school and middle school students education about prescription opiate painkillers. . The new programs, launching in Pennsylvania and Illinois, come as concerns grow that the drugs, accounting for 71 percent of all prescription drug overdose deaths, are drawing younger and more suburban users. . Nationwide, prescription opioids caused more than 16,000 deaths across all ages in 2013, a 50 percent increase from three years before, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Law enforcement officials say that abuse of the drugs has also contributed to a spike in heroin usage and deaths from heroin overdoses as some opiod users switch to the cheaper narcotic. . In an approach that experts say may be more effective than generalized anti-drug curricula of the past, the new programs target painkillers, a narcotic of choice for teenagers. . Developers of the programs emphasize the of use lengthy studies and interactive computer programs and focus on the science of addiction instead of scare tactics widely used in Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign of the 1980s and 1990s. . Even with fresh ideas, experts say, the new programs face a rocky road to success. . “The whole field is sort of in withdrawal,” said William Hansen, who runs All Stars, a leading school drug-prevention provider based in Greensboro, North Carolina. . One of the biggest obstacles in the anti-drug program field - funding - was exacerbated in 2011, when money for the former Office of the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities, a financial lifeline to school prevention programs, was slashed. . Schools’ focus on academic testing in recent years has knocked anti-drug programs off of their priority lists, said Hansen, who recently began writing a grant proposal to add special prescription drug education to his curricula. . The new programs also come at a time of heightened criticism of anti-drug programs in schools. . The most-used school prevention program Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, launched in Los Angeles in 1983, has been criticized in multiple evaluations, including in a 2001 U.S. Surgeon General report, for failing to prove its effectiveness in deterring drug use.  . The “Just Say No” mantra has been openly mocked for being overly simplified.  . The new programs contend they have developed more effective strategies. . “Our program really is looking at adolescent brain development, addiction on a brain level,” said Christopher Adzia, the program manager of an opioid-abuse prevention program at the Robert Crown Center for Health Education. . The Heroin Prevention Education program uses interactive software based on the life of a recovering teen heroin addict who began abusing opioid painkillers after having his wisdom teeth pulled and moved on to intravenous heroin use. . In hour-long programs, NOPE instructors teach students how to recognize symptoms of drug overdoses and emphasize the importance of quickly seeking medical attention for overdose victims. The programs also work to teach teens that prescription drugs are not safe to use other than under a doctor’s orders. . Around the same time that Chester County in Pennsylvania contracted with NOPE, schools in DuPage, Illinois, rolled out the curriculum developed by the Robert Crown Center. . Officials in other states are looking to follow suit. . Lawmakers in states including New Jersey, New York and Wisconsin have proposed measures to require public schools to educate students about the dangers of opioid drugs. . Downingtown School District prevention specialist Christina Forsythe said the first NOPE presentation at her high school appeared to be a success. . Senn, who sat at the back of the school’s auditorium with friend, Megha Reddy, 17, agreed but was cautious.  . “It will affect them,” he said of the presentation’s impact on his classmates. “How deeply it registers, I’m unsure of.”  |Mon Feb 09 12:33:52 +0000 2015||U.S. schools turn to new programs to warn teens of drug risks |5.64764116892799e+17|http://reut.rs/1ANNWGJ
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment. . Achillion’s shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor’s hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead’s and AbbVie Inc’s current therapies. . The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally. . The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options. . Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. . AbbVie’s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks. . Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy.  . The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. . Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. . The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair’s Katherine Xu said. . Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet. . The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount. . Harvoni’s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319. |Mon Feb 09 12:02:17 +0000 2015||Achillion, Gilead drug cocktail cures hepatitis C in six weeks |5.6475616583879885e+17|http://reut.rs/1FpiOMz
|FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Stada will launch a test next month that can diagnose Ebola virus infections within minutes, it said on Monday, a move it hopes will help to slow the spread of the disease. . The test, which is being marketed by Stada, was developed and produced by unlisted German diagnostics firm Senova. It yields results based on pre-treated patient blood samples within about 10 minutes. . Stada said its main use would likely be to diagnose the deceased because their body fluids do not need to be pre-treated before testing. Contact by mourners with their dead relatives is a common way for the disease to be transmitted.  . “The viral load in people who have died of Ebola is so high that a mere throat swab suffices to perform the rapid test,” Senova owner Hans Hermann Soeffing said. . The number of new cases of Ebola rose in all three of West Africa’s worst-hit countries last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, ending previously encouraging declines across the region. . In all, 8,981 people have died of Ebola out of 22,495 known cases in nine countries since the outbreak began in December 2013, according to the WHO. . Using Stada’s test on living patients will typically require pre-treating blood samples with battery-powered centrifuges, which are available at most emergency relief centers in the affected regions, a company spokesman said. . Stada, a supplier of generic drugs, non-prescription treatments and diagnostic kits, said it would distribute the test from next month to aid organizations for 3.20 euros ($3.66) apiece, which covers its costs. . The test has been shown to work in a trial with several hundred participants in Guinea, according to the company. . While Stada said the test was the first of its kind, there have been previous efforts to speed Ebola diagnosis. Health charity The Wellcome Trust said in November a new 15-minute Ebola test it helped fund was being tried out in Guinea, targeting six times faster testing than diagnostic kits currently in use. .

|LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Monday it would contribute 50 million dollars to a new IMF fund to help West African countries hit by Ebola to service their debts so they can use their own money to help save lives. . The IMF’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust was launched last week and is designed to help Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone cope with their debt service payments to the IMF for the next two years.  . The idea is that they can redirect other resources to help fight the outbreak, and to repair their economies and societies. Britain is the first country to pledge cash to the new fund.   . “Along with the human tragedy, the virus continues to have a devastating impact on the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone,” British finance minister George Osborne said in a statement.  . “So I am delighted to provide $50m of critical resources to enable these countries spend less money servicing their debt and more on the public health interventions that will help save lives.” |Mon Feb 09 00:19:57 +0000 2015||Britain becomes first country to donate to IMF Ebola debt relief fund |5.645794187658076e+17|http://reut.rs/1FnASqf
|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea’s government has authorized the wider use of an experimental drug to treat Ebola in treatment centers after successful initial trials, officials said on Saturday. . The expansion of the treatment comes as the number of people with Ebola in Guinea has doubled in the past week, reversing a broader trend of decline across the three worst-hit West African states - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . The experimental Japanese drug - Avigan, or favipiravir - developed by Toyama Chemical, a subsidiary of Japan’s Fujifilm, has been tested by French and Guinean teams in southern Guinea since mid-December. . French President Francois Hollande’s office said on Wednesday that the results had been positive and the drug appeared to accelerated the recovery process of patients. . “We have decided to broaden the use of this drug. It will only be available in the Ebola Treatment Units, not the hospitals,” Sakoba Keita, coordinator of Guinea’s Ebola response, told reporters on Saturday. . Guinea’s anti-Ebola task force said about two dozen new cases of Ebola had been recorded in the last two weeks, taking the total number to 53 as of Friday. Officials are accessing villages where they had previously faced local resistance to their presence. . Health officials have not provided any data for the results of the trials of the anti-Ebola drug. . Keita said that after testing in Gueckedou and Nzerekore, favipiravir has been distributed to the town of Coyah and talks are underway start treatment in the capital, Conakry. . “We are looking to see how we can get it to other parts of the country too,” he said. . The epidemic has killed nearly 9,000 people over the last year, mainly in the three worst-affected West African nations. . Guinea, where the outbreak began, has recorded over 1,900 dead from some 3,000 confirmed cases. . “The Ebola situation is getting better but we are not cured,” said Jean-François Delfraissy, a French Ebola expert working alongside Guinean authorities to contain the crisis. |Sat Feb 07 20:18:37 +0000 2015||Guinea to expand use of experimental anti-Ebola drugs |5.641562954531062e+17|http://reut.rs/1AGsWBN
Ruffin Prevost|CODY, Wyo. (Reuters) - The Wyoming Senate on Friday rejected a bill that would have supported the state’s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor under President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, effectively shutting the door for the remainder of year. . Opponents of the measure in the Republican-dominated state senate voiced concerns about possible complications with its implementation, and argued that increased health spending would add to the federal debt. . A companion bill in the state’s House of Representatives was pulled from committee as well on Friday.  . “Many Senators campaigned on the promise to not expand Medicaid services,” said Senate President Phil Nicholas after a 19-11 vote against the measure, adding that the chamber still worked “incredibly hard” to craft a bill that would have been revenue-neutral. . Republican Elaine Harvey, chair of the House Labor, Health and Social Services Committee, said “the House could amend this, but it would be an exercise in futility. The Senate won’t pass this no matter what we do.” . Republican Governor Matt Mead originally opposed any expansion of Medicaid, and had even been among a group of Republican governors who sued the federal government over Obamacare. . But changed his mind and in November said that an expansion would help the state make up for $200 million in costs absorbed by hospitals for uncompensated care, and could help more than 17,000 low-income residents. . “I believe that Wyoming’s working poor need health care coverage,” Mead said in a statement released after the Senate voted against the bill. “We must recognize what health care means to individuals and to our economy.” . Mead said the state fought against Obamacare and lost, and that a failure to expand Medicaid would mean “rejecting $120 million dollars meant for Wyoming.” . Last Tuesday, Indiana became the 28th state to expand the program under the healthcare reform law. The move, supported by a staunchly conservative Republican governor, will extend health coverage to some 350,000 low-income residents. |Sat Feb 07 04:48:48 +0000 2015||Wyoming Senate rejects Obamacare Medicaid expansion |5.639223026946048e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fh5SbC
Steve Gorman|(Reuters) - Students at all 10 campuses of the University of California will be required to be screened for tuberculosis and vaccinated for measles, mumps, rubella and other diseases under a new health plan set to take effect in 2017, the university said on Friday. . Announcement of the policy change, which goes beyond the hepatitis B shots already required of all 233,000 UC students, comes amid measles outbreaks that have infected more than 100 people in California and over a dozen more in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico since December. . Politicians and education and health officials at the national, state and local levels have found themselves suddenly reacting to the re-emergence of a highly contagious disease that had been declared eliminated as a U.S.-borne virus in 2000, after decades of immunization efforts.    . One of New Mexico’s largest public school districts, Santa Fe, will start barring unvaccinated students from class unless they have a valid state exemption, the head of the school board said on Friday.  . The recent flare-up has spurred legislators in California, Oregon and Washington state to consider laws to make it harder for parents legally to opt out of vaccinating school-aged children. Bills in several other states, including New York, Mississippi and West Virginia, would loosen restrictions. . U.S. congressional leaders and several possible 2016 presidential hopefuls addressed the issue this week, joining a renewed debate over parents’ right to forgo inoculation of their children and fears about potential side effects. . The Santa Fe district notified parents this week that any students who lack up-to-date vaccinations or bona fide state waivers for medical or religious grounds will be excluded from class starting on Feb. 17, board President Steven Carrillo said. . The district has not determined how many of its 14,000 students are unvaccinated or already exempted, he said. . The district action comes as New Mexico documented a steady rise in vaccine exemptions during the past two years, up 17 percent from 2012 to 2014 to 3,335 children. . State Health Department spokesman Kenny Vigil said waivers represent less than 1 percent of school-aged children statewide, though the department has voiced concern over the trend. . Just one measles case has been confirmed in New Mexico this winter, an unvaccinated baby who was hospitalized in December and has since recovered, Vigil said. It was the state’s first case since 2012.  . The origin of the child’s infection is unknown, he said, but the case was unrelated to the California outbreak because its onset in late November predates the first Disneyland infection. . California public health officials report 103 people have been diagnosed with measles in the state, many linked to exposure to an infected person from outside the country who visited Disneyland in late December. . Under the UC vaccination plan, which the university said has been in the works for a year, all incoming students are expected to be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, meningococcus, tetanus and whooping cough starting in 2016. But the plan will be strictly enforced starting in the fall of 2017. |Sat Feb 07 01:17:28 +0000 2015||Measles outbreak spurs new action in California, New Mexico |5.638691189073142e+17|http://reut.rs/1FgwUzU
|(Reuters) - The number of U.S. drivers under the influence of alcohol is steadily dropping, but the use of illegal drugs by drivers is on the rise, new data from a U.S. Transportation Department survey showed on Friday. . While about eight percent of drivers during weekend nighttime hours had alcohol in their system, only one percent were found with breath alcohol content higher than 0.08 percent- the legal limit in every state, according to the survey by the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). . This is a marked reduction from the 30 percent in the 2007  survey and down 80 percent from the first survey in 1973, the survey stated.  . Despite that, the use of illegal drugs and medicines that can impair driving capabilities is on the rise.  . The number of weekend nighttime drivers who were found with drugs in their system jumped from 16.3 percent in 2007 to 20 percent in 2014.  . The number of drivers with marijuana in their system grew by nearly 50 percent. . The survey also found that marijuana users are more likely to find themselves in an accident, mostly because they are more likely to be in groups at higher risk of crashes, the NHTSA survey said. |Sat Feb 07 01:01:40 +0000 2015||Drunk driving wanes in U.S., drug use by drivers rises: report |5.6386514246384435e+17|http://reut.rs/1ADcYIz

Lisa Rapaport|Contrary to suggestions that sleepy surgeons might make more mistakes in the middle of the night, a large study finds no differences in patient deaths after trauma surgeries done at night or during the day. . Researchers who looked at U.S. death rates after so-called exploratory laparotomies, which are done in trauma victims to discover the extent of injuries, found similar mortality both day and night.  . “Obviously, no one wants to get into an accident, but you can be reassured that whether it occurs during the day or at night, the outcomes in terms of mortality will be the same,” said study author Dr. Daniel Tran, assistant professor of surgery at Howard University College of Medicine. . “This is important because exploratory laparotomies are done in life and death situations when it’s not possible to wait for a better time of day to operate,” he told Reuters Health. . Tran and colleagues analyzed 2007-2010 data from the National Trauma Databank on 16,096 exploratory laparotomies started between midnight and 6 a.m. and 15,109 between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m.  . The average patient age was 36, and close to 80 percent were men. Most injuries were caused by car crashes, gunshots and stabbings.  . After daytime surgeries, 16.1 percent of patients died during their hospital stay. After middle-of-the-night surgeries, 11.5 percent died while in the hospital - but the difference wasn’t statistically significant after adjusting for other variables like patient age and severity of the injuries. . Patients treated during the day were typically older and had more severe injuries.  . “People who are involved in a lot of traumas at night can tend to be younger, and it can involve drinking,” said Dr. Angela Gardner, associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas and past president of the American College of Emergency Physicians.  . The study found the lowest mortality when the surgery began between 4 a.m. and noon.  . “There is a common belief that if you scheduled surgery, you should try to schedule in the morning,” said Gardner, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This data would certainly support that.” . One limitation of the study, published in The American Journal of Surgery, is the lack of data on individual surgeons, such as how experienced they are or how many hours they had worked before starting the operation.  . The findings also might not be relevant for more complex surgeries, said Dr. Carlos Pellegrini, chair of the surgery department at the University of Washington in Seattle and a past president of the American College of Surgeons.  . “The exploratory laparotomy in general is a relatively straightforward procedure for which mortality or morbidity are very low,” said Pellegrini, who wasn’t involved in the study.  . Pinpointing how sleep deprivation impacts surgical outcomes – and at what point a surgeon tips from fatigued, but functional, to exhausted and error-prone, is difficult. The idea that surgeons might make more mistakes at night is based on evidence linking disturbed sleep cycles and internal body clocks to impaired motor skills and diminished cognitive function in shift workers and night workers. . In a separate study in the same journal, Danish researchers monitored 30 surgeons for four days and found that working nights negatively affected circadian rhythm, the 24-hour cycle that tells the body when to sleep and regulates physiological functions.  . The researchers tested for two hormones – melatonin, which rises with fatigue, and cortisol, which increases with stress – starting a day before surgeons worked a 17-hour overnight shift and continuing for two days after.  . Melatonin fell during the night shifts, indicating an abnormal circadian rhythm.  . “Being awake in artificial light disrupts the circadian rhythm,” lead study author Dr. Ilda Amirian, from the department of surgery at Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen. . Cortisol, a stress hormone which might increase during a complex surgical procedure, was lower during the night shift than on the other days. . Results might be different in the U.S., where many surgeons work longer hours than in Denmark, Amirian said. . Still, taken together, the studies suggest that surgeons can adapt to night shifts, Pellegrini noted  . “It is extremely difficult in a single study to account for every variable that impacts performance,” Pellegrini said. “The studies here add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that surgeons, particularly experienced surgeons, can devise techniques to compensate for sleep disruption.” .

Kathryn Doyle|Users of an online weight loss program lost more when they participated in the social group, compared to more isolated users, a new study finds. . Both the number and the type of friends was important, said Luis A. Nunes Amaral, senior author of the analysis of the online community of Calorie King, a paid online weight loss program with social networking features. . “What we found out is the more embedded in the network you are, the more success you have,” Amaral told Reuters Health. “The fact that you have lots of friends that also have lots of friends, that’s how enmeshed into the network you are,” he said. “Having many friends who only have one friend would not be the same.” . The researchers examined data on more than 47,000 unique visitors to the online program in 2009 and 2010. Users self-reported their weights, but Amaral and other experts agreed that in these types of online programs, people are generally truthful in that respect. . Participants averaged 43 years old and more than 80 percent were female. . Only 22,400 people visited the program for a second weigh-in after signing up, meaning that 40 percent of people never returned. Of those who returned, 5,400 remained engaged for at least six months. About 2,000 connected with at least one “friend” in the social network, which left only a small fraction of the original group for the researchers to investigate. . Most of those who did establish friendships clustered in a giant group, while the remaining quarter formed small clusters of two to four people who were not linked to the main group. . Starting out with a higher weight, adhering to self-monitoring diaries and participating in social networking were all associated with greater weight loss. . At the six-month point, members who were not social networking had lost an average of 4.1 percent of their body weight. Those with two to nine friends lost an average of 5.2 percent, those in the giant cluster lost 6.8 percent and those with the most exchanges of online communication lost more than eight percent of their body weight, according to the results in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. . “People write posts and send messages, the system records them but we didn’t have access so we cannot know for sure what they said,” Amaral said. “It is known that in face to face interactions what happens is that people have support, they share experiences. We believe that the same thing is likely at play here.” . These results should be very encouraging for people who want to try these kinds of programs, he said. . “People worry a lot about what happens online, about people who are mean and negative and so-called ‘trolls’,” he said. Users have to pay to enter this particular online community, and once they are in they do all have the same goal, so people tend to cooperate, he said. . Membership in the Calorie King program currently costs $12 per month or $49 per year.  . Offline programs with a social element, like Weight Watchers, may be hard to attend for people with kids or complex responsibilities, Amaral said. . Other studies have found that social support on- and offline helps buoy weight loss success, said Rebecca A. Krukowski, of the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center in Memphis. She was not part of the new study, but noted previous research in which people in group-based weight loss programs had more success, regardless of their initial preference for a group or individual program. . Social support online typically isn’t as strong as in person, she told Reuters Health.  . Social support and commitment to self-tracking, by recording your weight, food and exercise, are key to successful weight loss, said Sandra L. Saperstein, a lecturer at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. . But it’s hard to know if inducing friendships and support is even possible, and if so, if it would increase weight loss, said Jean Harvey-Berino, at the University of Vermont in Burlington. . “This idea is that if you could just get people to act like Facebook in an online weight loss program it would be golden,” Harvey-Berino said. People who became most socially embedded in the current study may have been more “ready” to lose weight, or more committed to the program, she said. . It’s unclear if forcing less social people to make more connections would increase their readiness to lose weight. . SOURCE: .

Steve Gorman|(Reuters) - One of New Mexico’s largest public school districts, spurred by a measles outbreak that has infected about 100 people in California, will start barring unvaccinated students from class unless they have a valid state exemption, the head of the school board said on Friday.  . The move by the 14,000-student Santa Fe district came as legislators in California, Oregon and Washington state are considering laws to make it harder for parents legally to opt out of vaccinating school-aged children. Bills in several other states would loosen restrictions.  . The Santa Fe district notified parents this week that any students who lack up-to-date vaccinations or bona fide state waivers for medical or religious grounds will be barred from class starting on Feb. 17, board President Steven Carrillo said. . District officials have not determined how many Santa Fe public school children are unvaccinated and how many have already obtained waivers. Some schools are known to be at 100 percent compliance, others at 60 percent, Carrillo said. . The board’s action comes as New Mexico has documented a steady rise in the number of vaccine exemptions obtained by school-aged children during the past two years, up 17 percent from 2012 to 2014 to a total of 3,335 waivers. . Kenny Vigil, a spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Health, said the total still represents less than 1 percent of school-aged children statewide, though the department has voiced concern over the trend. . “An increase in vaccination exemptions can increase the risk for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles,” the department says on its website. . Only one case of measles has been confirmed in New Mexico so far this winter, an unvaccinated baby who was hospitalized with the highly contagious disease in December and has since recovered, Vigil said. It was the first case since 2012.  . The origin of the child’s infection is unknown, he said, but the case was unrelated to the California outbreak because the onset occurred in late November, before the first infection in California’s Disneyland is believed to have occurred. . Even so, “the impetus (for Santa Fe’s action) was obviously the measles outbreak in California,” Carrillo said, adding that other New Mexico districts would likely follow suit.  . California public health officials report 99 people have been diagnosed with measles in the state, many of them linked to exposure to an infected person from outside the country who visited Disneyland in late December. . More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico, renewing debate over the anti-vaccination movement. Fears about potential side effects of vaccines, debunked by the medical community, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to have their children vaccinated. . In Santa Monica, California, a toddler and infant center that was closed after one baby came down with the virus reopened on Friday under the caveat that all staff and returning children  provide proof of inoculation. Fourteen infants deemed too young to be vaccinated must stay home, a spokeswoman said. |Fri Feb 06 20:56:21 +0000 2015||U.S. measles outbreak prompts vaccine crackdown in New Mexico schools |5.6380340619249664e+17|http://reut.rs/1FfItY5
Linda Thrasybule|Eating blueberries every day might improve borderline high blood pressure in middle-aged women, according to a small U.S. study. . Women who ate freeze-dried blueberries for two months had lowered blood pressure and increased levels of a chemical that relaxes blood vessel walls. . “This tells us that blueberries may improve the health of blood vessels in addition to reducing blood pressure,” said Sarah Johnson, a nutrition and exercise researcher at Florida State University in Tallahassee who led the study.  . Johnson and her coauthors do not suggest that blueberries should replace hypertension medications. But they say the berries might help offset a tendency toward rising blood pressure and stiffening blood vessels after menopause that raises women’s heart disease risk. . Past research has suggested that blueberries may help lower blood pressure, the authors write in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Some studies have also indicated that the flavonoids and other healthy plant compounds in blueberries may help to boost nitric oxide, a chemical that affects the cells that line blood vessel walls.   . The 48 women in the study were all past menopause, with an average age of 55 and borderline high blood pressure.  . For eight weeks, half the women consumed 22 grams (about 1.5 tablespoons) of freeze-dried blueberry powder every day (equivalent to a cup of fresh blueberries) and the other half consumed an identical-looking powder that didn’t contain blueberry.  . At the beginning of the study, then four and eight weeks later, researchers measured their blood pressure and the stiffness of their arteries.  . According to the American Heart Association, a blood pressure reading of less than 120 mm Hg for the top number and less than 80 mm Hg for the bottom number is considered healthy. All the women in the study were either close enough to the top of the healthy range to be considered “pre-hypertensive” or already in the low end of the hypertension range. . At the start, the average blood pressure in both groups of women was 138/79 mm Hg. After four weeks, it hadn’t changed in either group.  . After eight weeks, however, women who had been eating blueberry powder had an average blood pressure of 131/75 mm Hg, representing a drop of 5 to 6 percent. The readings of women eating the fake powder had not changed. . The researchers also found that blood nitric oxide levels rose by 68 percent among women eating the real blueberry powder. The rise in nitric oxide, which would relax and widen blood vessel walls, could have contributed to their lower blood pressure, according to Johnson.  . She said the blood pressure decrease in the blueberry group is significant when compared to blood pressure medications and other types of interventions, but that it also depends on the individual.  . “People respond differently to medications and in some people medications are even less effective than this,” she said. “Some medications may work better but may also have negative side effects.” . Freeze-dried blueberry powder is available in stores and online for around $2 to $5 per ounce. . For women in the 50 to 55 age range who have borderline high blood pressure, medication isn’t always recommended, according to Dr. Chileshe Nkonde-Price, director of the Penn Women’s Cardiovascular Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study. . “Menopausal women who are often in that ‘gray zone’ can manage their blood pressure by maintaining a normal body weight through diet and exercise and watching their sodium intake,” she said. “But that can be hard to implement in everyday life.”  . Nkonde-Price thinks adding a cup of blueberries to a daily diet is “simple” and something her patients can easily handle. . More research into understanding how blueberries affect arterial function is needed, however, Nkonde-Price said. . “This study opens the gateway for other foods or other drugs that could lower blood pressure through the same mechanism,” she said.   . “I’d like to see more studies that show why foods or drugs work through this pathway.” .

Janice Neumann|Walkers and canes can be lifesavers for older people, but a new study highlights the downside of using them without training. . “A lot of older adults seem to struggle with their walking aids  . . .  they often drag along their walking aids like a burden with a difficult gait pattern as a result, possibly increasing the risk of falling,” said the study’s lead author, Tine Roman de Mettelinge of Ghent University in Belgium. . Older people need to be able to function independently, but gait problems can undermine that, even leading to nursing home admission, Roman de Mettelinge and her coauthor point out in the Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy. . The study followed 43 adults, ages 63 to 94, in a residential care facility in Belgium. Twenty-two used walking aids (most used a four-wheeled walker, two used a two-wheeled walker, one used a walker without wheels and one used a cane).   . Researchers tracked their falls, as well as factors that might have contributed to the accidents, such as cognitive problems, fear of falling, use of psychotropic drugs or age.  . They also measured residents’ muscle strength, walking speed, and how much their arms were swinging as they moved.	  . Altogether, 22 residents (15 using walking aids and seven not using walking aids) had at least one fall.  . After accounting for psychotropic drug use, falls in the previous years, older age, slower walking, longer periods spent standing still and less arm swinging, people who used walking aids were still nearly four times more likely to fall than those who did not. . Those who fell walked much more slowly and took smaller steps than those who did not fall.   . “A substantial proportion of the relationship between using walking aids and future falls” could be explained by altered gait, older age and use of psychotropic drugs, Roman de Mettelinge said in an email. The factors with the greatest effect seemed to be cadence, stance and swing percentage, she added. . Such results are “common knowledge to many researchers,” said Thurmon E. Lockhart, a professor in the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering at Arizona State University, who called the study “very, very important.” . But the take-home message isn’t as simple as avoiding walking aids, said Lockhart, who was not involved in the study. . “It gives kind of a mixed message but the bottom line is the device in itself may not cause future accidents, but at the same time since there’s a relationship between fall risk and the device use, we need to watch out for that a little in the future,” he said. . While a cane might help with mobility, it could also make it more difficult for people to stabilize themselves during a fall, Lockhart noted.   . “It’s almost all about how we recover” from loss of balance, he said. . Lockhart has developed a “slip simulator,” where an individual walks on a shifting linoleum floor controlled by a computer. The person wears a harness and learns to regain a sense of balance as the floor shifts. . “They’re learning about themselves, about their limits of balance and stability . . . the only way to train that is to slip and fall,” Lockhart said. . Roman de Mettelinge said doctors and therapists should consider an individual’s physical and mental abilities and living conditions before prescribing a walking aid.   . Someone who needs a walking aid should be given balance and gait exercises and then be trained to safely use a walker or cane, including proper gait patterns and ways to avoid falls, she said. The training should also include complicated maneuvers like opening and closing doors with the aid. . Roman de Mettelinge cautioned that the results of the study applied to individuals in assisted care facilities, who tend to be older and in poorer health than people still living at home.  .

Janice Neumann| (This story was refiled to correct byline) . By Janice Neumann . (Reuters Health) - A large new study suggests that people who have up to seven drinks a week in middle age have a lower risk of heart failure over the long term than those who abstain - though too much wine, beer or liquor could lead to an earlier death from other causes. . The study authors cautioned that people with heart failure should avoid alcohol, and that their study does not mean that others should start drinking “with abandon.”  . The results are based on observation over time, so they cannot prove that moderate drinking protects against heart failure, they added. . “We don’t know if alcohol is protective or if people who drink a little bit might do other things that might be contributing to their better health,” said Dr. Scott Solomon of Harvard Medical School in Boston, the study’s senior author. . While previous research has shown a link between mild to moderate alcohol intake and lower risk of coronary heart disease, such as heart attacks, “what we didn’t know was whether this would also extend to heart failure even in patients who did not have prior heart attacks,” Solomon said. . “We were concerned because there is some evidence that alcohol is toxic to the heart directly,” he said. . A moderate amount of alcohol is less than some people might expect - about seven drinks over the whole week. The study assumed that one drink contained 14 grams of alcohol, which is the amount in a little over five ounces of wine, 13 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of liquor.   . The researchers used data from the large and ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, following 14,629 adults who were 45 to 64 years old at the start of the study in 1987. People who didn’t drink at all made up 61 percent of those included in the analysis, though 19 percent were former drinkers. About 25 percent of the study population drank up to seven drinks weekly, 8 percent averaged seven to 14 drinks a week, 3 percent had 14 to 21 drinks weekly and 3 percent drank 21 or more. . Men who had up to 14 drinks weekly were 20 percent less likely than abstainers to develop heart failure and women who drank up to 7 glasses weekly were 16 percent less likely, according to the results in the European Heart Journal. . “If we were giving a drug and doing this in a trial and showing that effect, people would say, okay that’s a modest reduction,” Solomon told Reuters Health.  “It’s simply not as robust for women,” he said. . “It could be women are smaller in general and so this might have to do to some degree with body size. But also other factors with gender in terms of how we metabolize alcohol,” he added. . A higher percentage of men and women developed heart failure if they were former drinkers compared to those who never drank. Men and women who drank 21 or more drinks weekly were also more likely to die from other causes than those who didn’t drink that much.	 . “The decision to stop drinking may not be random, it may be influenced by other factors that might be related to risk of illness,” said Solomon, who also directs Noninvasive Cardiology and the Cardiac Imaging Core Laboratory and Clinical Trials Endpoints Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. . Showing that link between a low to moderate amount of alcohol and lower risk of heart failure (and not just heart attacks or stroke) is a “novel” finding, said Dr. Andrew J. Sauer at the Center for Heart Failure, Heart Transplantation, Mechanical Assistance at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.  . “A lot of us in the heart failure community have been suggesting something similar for patients,” said Sauer, who was not involved in the study. . He pointed out that the researchers accounted for factors like age, education, body mass index, smoking, cholesterol and high blood pressure, which bolsters the suggestion that alcohol is what protected people from heart failure.   . But, the study did not show how often people were drinking daily or whether they might have even had seven drinks in one night, he said. Sauer also noted that many people pour seven or eight ounces of wine when they drink, and people who could stick to a truly moderate amount “are probably very disciplined” and might therefore have healthier lifestyles. . “A little more alcohol in your diet is continuing to show up . . .  as a potential protector for cardiovascular events,” Sauer said. “But until there is a trial where people are randomized to abstaining or drinking low to moderate amounts, we’ll never know for sure.”  .

Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - Authorities fighting Ebola must do more to tackle a high death rate among young children whose isolation from parents also causes great distress and deprives them of the extra care they need, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday. . Reporting on a meeting of clinicians from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, it said there was a consensus that the strict “no touch” policy for Ebola patients could be lifted if good measures are in place to protect health workers from infection. . “There is a need to address issues around children and pregnant women. Children under five had a very high rate of mortality, this was often because need a great deal of support to be fed, to be cared for,” WHO technical adviser Dr. Margaret Harris told a news briefing. . Mortality in children under five years of age has been 80 percent, meaning four out of five die, and up to 95 percent among under one-year-olds who require intensive nursing and frequent feeding, she said. . “There was quite some suggestion that simply being separated and isolated as happens in an Ebola treatment unit had a devastating psychological effect on children, they did not have parents, they did not have carers,” Harris said. . “The complexities of dealing with children, especially children under-one, were not really being met and they need to be met.” . At least 21 pregnant women survived the hemorrhagic disease, but their babies or fetuses rarely did, she said. . Nearly 9,000 people have died out of 22,495 known cases in the epidemic that began in December 2013. . Survivors have displayed symptoms including severe muscle pain, headaches, mood swings, depression, loss of concentration and impaired vision, according to the WHO. Reuters reported this week that some of the 5,000 to 10,000 survivors complain of side effects months after their recovery. . The U.N. Children’s Fund said 16,600 children in the three countries have lost one or both parents. But communities and extended family members have taken in all but about 500 of them, overcoming initial fears and stigma. . “Having said that, what really struck me when I was visiting the families in Liberia, however strong that family and relative support is, the grief is very raw,” Andrew Brooks, UNICEF regional child protection adviser, said by telephone from Dakar. . “The children, it doesn’t take much for them to get very, very upset. I don’t think we should under-estimate that side of things in addition to the economic and material support.” |Fri Feb 06 16:21:55 +0000 2015||High rates of child deaths from Ebola, special care needed: WHO |5.6373434048475136e+17|http://reut.rs/1FeHLKq
Katy Migiro|JUBA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the swampy frontlines of South Sudan’s conflict, women spend hours pounding wild fruits, water lilies and grasses to feed their children, just two months after the harvest. . Aid workers fear famine will again threaten South Sudan in the next few months if forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and his rival Riek Machar continue to shell food distributions, loot aid and menace humanitarian staff. . Fighting which erupted in December 2013 has forced two million people to flee their homes, killed up to 50,000 people and hurt efforts to tackle South Sudan’s chronic hunger problem. . One in five South Sudanese — 2.5 million people in total — will need food aid up to March, 1 million more than in September, experts said in the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment released this week. . According to the analysis, 1.6 million people are in crisis and 890,000 in emergency — phases three and four on a five-point scale where five is famine. . “If the guns don’t fall silent for humanitarian support to go in, they would still be having this looming possibility of localized famine,” said Bernard Owadi, World Food Programme’s (WFP) lead food security analyst in South Sudan. . Ensuring South Sudan’s population has enough to eat is a constant battle in a country where large swathes of land are cut off and where roads only exist for a few, dry months each year. . “It’s the most complex operational country (in the world),” said Peter Schaller, WFP’s chief of logistics in South Sudan. . “You need about 10 contingency plans for one task.” . Poor infrastructure and security issues make it harder to work in South Sudan than the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, he said.     . Delivering aid into war zones is a logistical nightmare, requiring lengthy negotiations and clearances from warring parties. From Somalia to Syria, aid can often end up in the wrong hands. . Hungry soldiers in South Sudan, who struggle to get resupplied, use firepower, force and manipulation to try to requisition aid intended for their starving populations. . While the militant group al Shabaab blocked food aid from reaching famine-stricken Somalis in 2011, South Sudan’s fighters have long siphoned it off to feed themselves and control populations. . In camps in the capital Juba, women uprooted by conflict carry 50kg sacks of sorghum, the country’s staple food, complaining it was the first food they had received in four months due to a dispute between their leaders and aid agencies. . “I don’t know why we didn’t receive food,” said Angelina Nyagang Mat, in a red and yellow headscarf and dangling earring, her face beaded with sweat. “The only ones who know are the camp chairman and the U.N.” . Unlike many parts of the world where food aid is presented in cash or vouchers — for local goods replacing food shipped half way round the world — in South Sudan, agencies are still using planes, trucks and barges to bring in supplies. . From May to December, nearly 70 percent of South Sudan can only be reached by air due to flooding. This gives relief groups five dry months to deliver and store a year’s worth of aid. . WFP deploys 1,000 commercial trucks, supplied by 32 different companies, to make road deliveries in South Sudan. Last year, 180 trucks got stuck in the mud for five months. The agency had to bring in murram and bulldozers to repair the roads and get the vehicles out. . “Every convoy passing through conflict areas means a lot of sleepless nights,” said George Fominyen, WFP’s spokesman in South Sudan. . Another problem is finding people brave enough to make the deliveries. Transporters who have been held up at gunpoint and had their food stocks looted do not return. . Agencies cannot send Dinka staff into Nuer areas and vice versa, following massacres along ethnic lines. In August, six aid workers were killed in Upper Nile state. . “A lot of staff left because of the ethnic situation,” said Vilma Tyler, Unicef’s chief of nutrition. . Operations in which relief agencies cross between government- and rebel-held territory are the most dangerous. . Usually these areas can only be reached by air as it is too risky for trucks to travel the same roads as hungry troops. WFP has four Ilyushin cargo planes, four Mi8 helicopters and two Mi26s, one of the largest helicopters in existence, to make air deliveries. . The hungriest people are the ones closest to the front lines. And they keep moving. In the time it takes to carry out an assessment and negotiate access, fighting can force people to flee again, aid workers said. . “They scatter. So when you had one location to do the distribution, suddenly you find they have dispersed to five, seven, eight other locations,” WFP’s Schaller said. . Famine warnings were issued for the period between June and August last year, when four million people needed food aid. . The crisis eased in September due to a massive influx of aid and rains leading to a harvest. But food stocks are running out again, people on the move cannot farm and there is virtually nothing on sale in active conflict zones. . The latest IPC analysis said in the three worst-hit areas, more than 30 percent of children are malnourished and nutrition is ‘very critical’, phase five on a five-point scale. . “We are not talking famine right now, but the situation is dire,” said Tyler of Unicef. “If we do not continue to intervene, and intervene right now, we are going to end up with children dying. We are going to end up having famine.” |Fri Feb 06 16:03:47 +0000 2015||Famine threat to South Sudan if war continues to block aid |5.637297792336691e+17|http://reut.rs/1FeD2Za
|CONAKRY (Reuters) - The number of people sick with Ebola fever has doubled in Guinea in the past week following the discovery of cases previously unknown to health authorities, a Guinea health official said on Friday. . About two dozen new suspected and confirmed Ebola cases were recorded in the past two weeks, taking the total number to 53 as of Friday, Fode Tass Sylla, a spokesman for Guinea’s anti-Ebola task force, said. . Sylla said the increase was expected because health authorities were only now gaining access to faraway villages where inhabitants had previously prevented them from entering. . “This increase in new case numbers is because we are now able to get to villages where we are discovering hidden sick cases,” he said.        . The new cases highlights difficulties authorities in the three worst-hit West African states — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia — face in trying to curb the spread of the epidemic that has killed nearly 9,000 people. . Thought to be declining at the start of 2015, the number of new Ebola cases rose in all three countries for the first time this year in the past week, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. . Some 36 villages in the south and western forest region of Guinea, where the first case of Ebola was recorded, had previously been inaccessible to health officials because villagers sometimes used violence to stop health workers. . “Even in Conakry (Guinea’s coastal capital), there are some neighborhoods such as Ratoma where we had the same kind of situation,” Sylla said.  . Guinea’s government on January 10, set a 60-day target to completely eradicate the disease in the nation, a gold, iron ore and bauxite producer but where nearly 60 percent of the population live below the poverty line.    . However, there are doubts this could be achieved due to high levels of mistrust of health authorities, the practice of traditional rituals such as burials, and general misinformation about the disease.  |Fri Feb 06 12:49:56 +0000 2015||Guinea Ebola infections double as hidden cases discovered |5.63680992763052e+17|http://reut.rs/1FdZKRm
Eric M. Johnson|SEATTLE/PORTLAND, Ore (Reuters) - Several U.S. states are considering laws to make it harder for parents to legally opt out of vaccinating their children, as health officials fight a measles outbreak that has sickened some 120 people in more than a dozen mostly West Coast states. . Lawmakers in California, Oregon, and Washington state, which have all had recent measles cases, want to remove exemptions based on personal beliefs, while farther afield, Ohio recently extended a law that covers those entering childcare. . All U.S. states require certain vaccines for students for diseases such as mumps, rubella, tetanus, or polio, but school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for medical reasons, including an inhibited immune system. At least 20 states extend exemptions to include a range of personal beliefs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. . “I’m a physician and a mother. I don’t want my kids exposed to un-immunized kids,” said Oregon Senator Elizabeth Hayward, a Portland Democrat. “These are totally preventable diseases.” . Health officials have reported that more than 120 people across the U.S. have been infected with measles, many of them traced to an outbreak that began at a Disneyland theme park in Anaheim in December.    . Lawmakers in California, which has 99 confirmed cases, said on Wednesday they would introduce legislation requiring all school children to be vaccinated unless a child’s life is threatened.   . On Thursday, five babies at a suburban Chicago daycare center were diagnosed with measles. All are under 1 year old and would not have been subject to a routine vaccination, which begins at 12 months.   . In Ohio, a law requiring children enrolled in a licensed childcare facility to be immunized against measles and other diseases takes effect in March, a state Department of Health spokeswoman told Reuters. . Oregon, with some of the country’s lowest immunization rates, passed a 2013 law requiring parents to obtain a doctor’s signature or watch an educational video on vaccination risks and benefits. Colorado forces schools to collect and publish data about vaccination and exemption rates. . “The vast majority of the exemptions currently being used are the personal ones,” said Washington state Representative June Robinson.  . But some lawmakers are going the other way, backing measures that expand parental freedoms even in the face of mainstream medicine and science supporting vaccinations. . Bills in New York State and Montana would add philosophical and personal beliefs to the current medical exemption, while proposals in Mississippi and West Virginia would add exemptions for “medical reasons or conscientious beliefs” and on religious grounds, respectively.  . Debate over vaccinating has even seeped into the 2016 presidential race, with at least two potential Republican candidates in the last week causing a stir after voicing support for giving parents some choice in whether to immunize their children. |Fri Feb 06 01:12:15 +0000 2015||Lawmakers want tougher vaccine exemptions amid U.S. measles outbreak |5.6350541787223245e+17|http://reut.rs/1AxQLeU
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . The germs that call New York City’s subways, parks and waterways home are often a reflection of the people who live there and the events that affect daily life, a new study shows. . “You can see a molecular echo of what’s left behind,” said Christopher Mason, the study’s lead author and a geneticist from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. . He and his colleagues used nylon swabs to collect DNA from surfaces in New York City’s subways, subway stations, parks and one waterway. Altogether, they analyzed over 10 billion DNA fragments from their swabs. . The fragments of human DNA found on surfaces in the subway reflected the local population. . “The small traces of human DNA left behind on surfaces serve as a mirror or echo of people who move through that station,” Mason said. . In one station that was flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, they found Mother Nature’s mark: germs linked to marine life and Antarctic environments.  . While some may think ignorance is bliss when it comes to knowing what’s living on subway railings and turnstiles, the researchers write in the journal Cell Systems that mapping a major city’s germ profile can be helpful in the future. . The findings, Mason said, “establish the first city baseline of microbial life under our fingertips.” . “Now that we have this baseline, you can detect strong changes that may determine if there is anything at all threatening,” such as the spread of a disease or bioterrorism, he said. . For example, the researchers now know there are already traces of DNA that match anthrax and the plague on the subway. Future researchers don’t need to worry if they find the same low levels of those germs in any future investigation into bioterrorism. . “In the case of the plague, we see fragments associated with the plague but not strong evidence of the plague itself,” he said, adding that the same is true for anthrax. . Also, the researchers found, about half of all the germs they analyzed for the study had never been seen before. Mason said that may be because they can’t be grown for analysis. . Despite the unknown germs and the possible connections to anthrax and the plague, the researchers say people shouldn’t be afraid to ride the rails or generally touch surfaces around the city. . Even for people with compromised immune systems, such as those receiving intense cancer treatments, Mason said it’s just another reminder to practice good hygiene. . “The majority really of everything you touch represents a very healthy ecosystem that mirrors what’s on your own skin,” he said. .

Janet Neumann|A large new study suggests that people who have up to seven drinks a week in middle age have a lower risk of heart failure over the long term than those who abstain - though too much wine, beer or liquor could lead to an earlier death from other causes. . The study authors cautioned that people with heart failure should avoid alcohol, and that their study does not mean that others should start drinking “with abandon.”  . The results are based on observation over time, so they cannot prove that moderate drinking protects against heart failure, they added. . “We don’t know if alcohol is protective or if people who drink a little bit might do other things that might be contributing to their better health,” said Dr. Scott Solomon of Harvard Medical School in Boston, the study’s senior author. . While previous research has shown a link between mild to moderate alcohol intake and lower risk of coronary heart disease, such as heart attacks, “what we didn’t know was whether this would also extend to heart failure even in patients who did not have prior heart attacks,” Solomon said. . “We were concerned because there is some evidence that alcohol is toxic to the heart directly,” he said. . A moderate amount of alcohol is less than some people might expect - about seven drinks over the whole week. The study assumed that one drink contained 14 grams of alcohol, which is the amount in a little over five ounces of wine, 13 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of liquor.   . The researchers used data from the large and ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, following 14,629 adults who were 45 to 64 years old at the start of the study in 1987. People who didn’t drink at all made up 61 percent of those included in the analysis, though 19 percent were former drinkers. About 25 percent of the study population drank up to seven drinks weekly, 8 percent averaged seven to 14 drinks a week, 3 percent had 14 to 21 drinks weekly and 3 percent drank 21 or more. . Men who had up to 14 drinks weekly were 20 percent less likely than abstainers to develop heart failure and women who drank up to 7 glasses weekly were 16 percent less likely, according to the results in the European Heart Journal. . “If we were giving a drug and doing this in a trial and showing that effect, people would say, okay that’s a modest reduction,” Solomon told Reuters Health.  “It’s simply not as robust for women,” he said. . “It could be women are smaller in general and so this might have to do to some degree with body size. But also other factors with gender in terms of how we metabolize alcohol,” he added. . A higher percentage of men and women developed heart failure if they were former drinkers compared to those who never drank. Men and women who drank 21 or more drinks weekly were also more likely to die from other causes than those who didn’t drink that much.	 . “The decision to stop drinking may not be random, it may be influenced by other factors that might be related to risk of illness,” said Solomon, who also directs Noninvasive Cardiology and the Cardiac Imaging Core Laboratory and Clinical Trials Endpoints Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. . Showing that link between a low to moderate amount of alcohol and lower risk of heart failure (and not just heart attacks or stroke) is a “novel” finding, said Dr. Andrew J. Sauer at the Center for Heart Failure, Heart Transplantation, Mechanical Assistance at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.  . “A lot of us in the heart failure community have been suggesting something similar for patients,” said Sauer, who was not involved in the study. . He pointed out that the researchers accounted for factors like age, education, body mass index, smoking, cholesterol and high blood pressure, which bolsters the suggestion that alcohol is what protected people from heart failure.   . But, the study did not show how often people were drinking daily or whether they might have even had seven drinks in one night, he said. Sauer also noted that many people pour seven or eight ounces of wine when they drink, and people who could stick to a truly moderate amount “are probably very disciplined” and might therefore have healthier lifestyles. . “A little more alcohol in your diet is continuing to show up . . .  as a potential protector for cardiovascular events,” Sauer said. “But until there is a trial where people are randomized to abstaining or drinking low to moderate amounts, we’ll never know for sure.”  .

|NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Thursday approved Medicare coverage for lung cancer screening by low-dose CT, the first time the government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled will pay for such a program of early detection in an effort to save lives. . The decision applies to Medicare beneficiaries aged 55-77 who are current smokers or who quit within the last 15 years, and who racked up at least 30 “pack years.” The latter is possible if they smoked one pack a day for 30 years, for instance, two packs a day for 15 or three packs a day for a decade. . The coverage is effective immediately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced, and applies nationwide. . In a statement, CMS chief medical officer Dr. Patrick Conway called the decision to pay for a once-a-year screening “an important new Medicare preventive benefit since lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.” . The usually-incurable disease will kill about 158,000 people in the U.S. this year, according to the American Cancer Society; 221,200 cases will be diagnosed. |Thu Feb 05 22:21:00 +0000 2015||U.S. approves Medicare coverage for lung cancer screening |5.6346232136926e+17|http://reut.rs/1FbDMOV
Jessica Dye|CHARLESTON, West Virginia (Reuters) - A U.S. judge Thursday urged transvaginal mesh device makers and the women suing them to work harder to resolve their tens of thousands of lawsuits in one of the biggest U.S. mass torts in history. . “I’m going to kick it into high gear and ask that you do the same,” said U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in Charleston, West Virginia. The courtroom was packed with plaintiffs’ lawyers and representatives for the key defendants, including Boston Scientific Corp, C.R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc.  . More than 70,000 transvaginal mesh lawsuits against seven companies have been consolidated before Goodwin, and additional cases continue to be filed. . Goodwin said it would take decades to try all the cases, cost millions of dollars in fees and put the lawsuits’ fates in the hands of unpredictable jurors. But, if no settlement emerges, he promised he would send them to trial as quickly as possible. . The judge’s comments kicked off two days of intensive court-supervised meetings with key officials and counsel for the companies, along with lead lawyers for women who say they have been injured by mesh devices, used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. . The companies facing the most cases – Bard, Ethicon and Boston Scientific – have each been hit with multimillion dollar verdicts for women who said the mesh caused painful infections, bleeding and other complications. The size of those verdicts has ratcheted up the pressure to settle.  . The companies stand behind the devices and deny that they are defective. Ethicon and Boston Scientific also notched some victories in early trials. On Thursday, the three companies’ lawyers said they are ready to prepare hundreds of additional cases for trial. . Goodwin praised American Medical Systems, a subsidiary of Endo International Plc, for deciding to settle. The company said last year it would set aside up to $1.6 billion to resolve 20,000 lawsuits. That figure suggests the high stakes for the three main defendants, which each face a comparable number of cases. . Danish company Coloplast A/S has also settled a substantial chunk of the nearly 2,000 mesh lawsuits against it. |Thu Feb 05 20:32:55 +0000 2015||U.S. judge urges settlement in transvaginal mesh lawsuits |5.634351197768991e+17|http://reut.rs/1AwSxNi
Shereen Lehman|Organized walking groups improve the walkers’ blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, mood and other aspects of health with little downside, according to a new analysis of recent research. . UK researchers looked at a total of 42 studies done since the late 1980s to see if participating in a walking group did more than just fulfill recommended physical activity guidelines.  . “Walking groups are increasingly popular but until now we have not known if there are wider health benefits from walking groups, apart from increasing physical activity,” study co-author Sarah Hanson told Reuters Health in an email. . Hanson, a researcher with the Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia said the findings provide clinicians with evidence of an effective option to recommend to those patients who would benefit from increasing moderate physical activity.  . “We would love to see walking groups more widely recommended by physicians, health trainers and nurses,” she said. . In the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Hanson and her coauthor note that outdoor walking groups are all the rage in the UK. They cite the example of Walking for Health, a program created 15 years ago by an Oxford general practitioner that is now the country’s largest walking network, with 70,000 walkers, 15,000 volunteer walk leaders and 3,000 walks offered every week. . For their study, the researchers reviewed all the research they could find on outdoor walking groups for adults, including only studies that tracked physical and mental health changes in the participants. . Data on more than 1,800 walkers in 14 countries was included in the new analysis. The studies mostly examined walking as a potential therapy for an existing condition, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia, Parkinson’s disease and others, although healthy people were also included in some studies. . The researchers found that, on average, participants who joined walking groups experienced meaningful improvements in lung power, overall physical functioning and general fitness, in addition to the changes in blood pressure, body mass index and other important risk factor measures. . The participants also tended to be less depressed after joining the walking groups, although there was no apparent effect on other mental health conditions. . And other significant risk factors, such as waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and “good” cholesterol, also remained unchanged. . About three of every four participants stayed with their walking groups throughout the studies and the only side effects reported were a few falls and one calf injury.  . Hanson said it’s important for people to realize that physical activity doesn’t have to be limited to participation in sports, adding that something like walking in a group can become a good habit. . “Outdoor walking groups need no longer be viewed as just a leisure activity, they are enjoyable and have wide ranging health benefits – psychological as well as physical,” she said. . The British Heart Foundation website offers tips on preparing for group walking (. ). The American Heart Association website also offers resources for finding or starting organized walking groups (. ).  . Hanson noted that she is currently doing research on the appeal of the social aspect of walking in groups. . “There are a lot of lonely, isolated people who really benefit from this aspect of the group,” she said. “For others, though, a group walk represents an opportunity to be led on a walk with people around (the presence of others) and have quiet head clearing time, which is equally important too.” . Dr. Gunther Neumayr, whose research has found similar benefits from hiking, told Reuters Health in an email, “Humans were selected for motion and not for inactivity - inactivity makes us ill.” . Neumayr, a physician in Lienz, Austria, who was not involved in the UK study, said, “Evidence is growing that inactivity has become the most important single cardiovascular risk factor.”  . Walking is a low-to-moderate intensity exercise that can be performed by everyone, Neumayr said.  . “Walking and hiking are the original forms of motion and should be more recommended by public health campaigns to face this epidemic of inactivity,” he said. .

Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - Efforts to stamp out West Africa’s Ebola epidemic are being thwarted by villagers touching and washing the infectious bodies of dead victims at secret burials and difficulty in tracing those exposed to the virus, U.N. officials said on Thursday. . The number of new cases rose for the first time this year in the past week, coinciding with a looming funding shortfall and the approach of the rainy season that will hamper aid efforts from April, they warned.   . “The commonest way in which people are getting Ebola is through the rituals that take place when somebody is buried, particularly the important cleansing and touching that goes on,” Dr. David Nabarro, U.N. Ebola special envoy, told a briefing. . Some communities in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone believe traditional practices are needed for the departed’s spirit and the society, so it is “asking a lot of them” to change, he said. . “The flares (in new cases) that we’re seeing are usually because there has been an unsafe burial, probably done secretly,” Nabarro said. . Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization’s special representative on Ebola, said that the 124 new cases recorded in the week to Feb. 1, up from 99 the previous week, also reflected the virus’ spread to border areas near Mali and Senegal. . “The virus has told us this week loud and clear I’m not going to go away the way you are expecting me to based on these (epidemiological) curves. And all I have to do is survive out the next couple of weeks or months until the rains hit, and then you’re going to have a very, very difficult situation,” he said. . But the WHO, the U.N. agency leading the fight against the year-old epidemic that has killed nearly 9,000 people, faces financial constraints. . “Right now though, our funding for those 800 people out there in the field, it ends at the end of February. That is how precarious the situation is right now in terms of being able to sustain this,” Aylward said. . The five new cases reported in Liberia last week were all people on lists of contacts of Ebola patients, he said, noting that the success rate may prove hard to sustain. In Guinea the rate was 54 percent and in Sierra Leone 57 percent. . “As soon as they develop fever and become sick, if you get them into isolation they will not initiate another chain of transmission,” Aylward said.  . “This is part of the end-game of Ebola, it is trying to monitor those contacts.”    |Thu Feb 05 20:06:05 +0000 2015||Secret burials thwarting efforts to stamp out Ebola: U.N |5.634283673123553e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fb4Dup
Mary Wisniewski|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Five babies at a suburban Chicago daycare center have been diagnosed with measles, adding to a growing outbreak of the disease across the United States, Illinois health officials said on Thursday. . Officials are investigating the cluster of measles cases at KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, said a statement from the Illinois and Cook County health departments. All the children are under 1 year old and would not have been subject to routine measles vaccination, which begins at 12 months. . The source of the infection was not immediately known. . Public health officials have reported that more than 100 people across the United States have been infected with measles, many of them traced to an outbreak that began at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California, in December. . “These cases underscore the need for everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to ensure that they have been vaccinated,” Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a statement. “There are certain individuals who, because of their age or clinical condition, cannot be vaccinated.” . One adult in Illinois was recently diagnosed with measles. The diagnoses for the adult and two of the babies have been confirmed through laboratory testing, health officials said. . Test results for the other three cases are still pending, but they have been diagnosed based on clinical and epidemiological criteria, officials said. . On the advice of health officials, the KinderCare center is excluding until Feb. 24 unvaccinated children and staff who may have been exposed to the virus, according to a statement from Knowledge Universe, KinderCare’s parent company. The center was given a “deep clean” on Wednesday night, the statement said. . Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can be fatal in some cases. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have led a minority of parents to not have their children inoculated. . Last year, the United States had 644 cases from 27 states, the most since 2000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. |Thu Feb 05 18:22:37 +0000 2015||Five babies at suburban Chicago daycare center have measles: report |5.634023276848169e+17|http://reut.rs/1Awunmf
Brendan O'Brien|(Reuters) - A preliminary test for the Ebola virus has come back negative for a patient who remains in isolation and doing well on Thursday at a Wisconsin hospital, health officials said. . The unidentified patient, whose age and gender have not been released, is being treated in the isolation unit at Meriter Hospital in the state capital Madison, according to hospital spokeswoman Leah Huibregtse. . The patient is “doing well” after a preliminary test came back negative for the Ebola virus, she said. . The patient came to the hospital on Monday after recently traveling, Huibregtse and the Department of Public Health for Madison and Dane County said. . “This is not an indication of Ebola virus disease and there is no risk to the public,” the health department said in a statement. . At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States, four of them diagnosed with it on U.S. soil, during a West African outbreak that has killed at least 8,900 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. |Thu Feb 05 18:06:57 +0000 2015||Wisconsin patient in isolation after testing negative for Ebola |5.633983863057613e+17|http://reut.rs/1FaB2kQ

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday it remained worried about the spread of MERS, a respiratory disease that has infected and killed hundreds of people, overwhelmingly in Saudi Arabia. . In an update issued after a meeting of its emergency committee on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the United Nations health agency said more must be done to track the virus, which is known to have infected at least 965 people, of whom some 357 have died. . “Although the pattern of transmission appears relatively unchanged, the overall situation and the possibility of international spread remains of concern,” the WHO said. . “Increased surveillance in many countries is needed to better monitor trends related to the spread of this virus.” . There is no cure or vaccine for MERS, which kills around 40 percent of its victims. The virus causes coughing, fever and  breathing problems, and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.  . First identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family as the one that caused a deadly outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in China in 2003.  . The WHO said the MERS outbreak, which appeared to peak in Saudi Arabia in April and May last year, “is currently characterized by sporadic cases and clusters of cases in communities and in healthcare settings, mostly in Saudi Arabia”. . A small number of cases have been exported by travelers, it said, but there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. . The MERS virus has been linked to camels, and the WHO and Saudi health officials have issued advice to people to avoid direct contact with the animals, or adhere to good hygiene practices when they are in contact. . But good data on MERS remains in short supply. . “Additional information from studies is ... required to better understand the risk factors for infection and transmission,” it said. “In particular, the results of case-control studies from affected countries are urgently needed.” |Thu Feb 05 17:51:08 +0000 2015||WHO still concerned about spread of Saudi MERS virus |5.633944048081592e+17|http://reut.rs/1FawniQ
Anna Yukhananov|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has granted Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone debt relief of about $100 million in total, the first time a global institution has provided such relief to the three West African nations hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak. . The IMF, urging similar action from other international creditors to help the countries deal with the economic fallout of the deadly epidemic, additionally offered the nations $160 million in zero-interest loans, subject to board approval. . The number of new cases of Ebola rose in all three countries last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week, ending several weeks of encouraging declines across the region. . “Those three countries are going through a very, very dramatic ordeal that combines pandemics, the risk of isolation” and the potential of the virus to spread, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters. “Which gives it a very broad scope and constitutes a significant threat.” . The United States first proposed that the IMF offer some debt relief to the three impoverished West African countries to enable them to spend more on government services and their economies. . The IMF normally offers loans, not grants. However, alongside the announcement Thursday, it established a special catastrophe trust to offer grants to countries hit by epidemics or other natural disasters. . Lagarde said at least two countries have committed further bilateral support to the new trust fund, but didn’t provide details. . “Essentially, a global social safety net is now in place to protect the least developed countries when they experience disasters,” said Eric LeCompte, executive director of the Jubilee USA Network, which campaigns for debt relief for poor countries. . The $100 million grant would allow each country to service their IMF debts over the next two years, the Fund said. . The Group of 20 major economies had urged the IMF last year to provide $300 million in funds to help stem the Ebola outbreak and support the three West African countries. |Thu Feb 05 16:43:40 +0000 2015||IMF grants $100 million debt relief to Ebola-hit countries |5.6337742648785715e+17|http://reut.rs/1FachVU
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - For hospitals, patient satisfaction ratings don’t necessarily line up with cancer surgery stats, according to a new study. . “I don’t think the results are necessarily surprising, they just highlight that there is very little publicly reported hospital data to help guide cancer patients in decision making,” said lead author Dr. Jason D. Wright of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. . It’s difficult to say if the results would be similar with a different group of patients who were not undergoing surgery for cancer, he said. . The researchers used a database of more than 63,000 patients who had solid cancer tumors removed surgically at 448 hospitals in the U.S. The Hospital Compare database collects patient satisfaction ratings, quality of care measures – such as whether patients received guideline-recommended medications - and 30-day surgical outcomes.  . Patients can search the Hospital Compare tool for ratings here: .  . Satisfaction ratings are based on a 27-question patient survey focusing on their experiences of communication with hospital staff, staff responsiveness, the facility’s cleanliness and quietness, pain management, medication communication and discharge planning.  . Patients also rate their overall experience on a 10-point scale and say whether they would recommend the hospital to others. Based on responses to these last two questions, Wright’s team found that patient satisfaction ratings did not predict the risk of death or complications like heart attack, cardiac arrest, blood clot or stroke at the rated hospitals.  . Dividing the hospitals into four groups based on patient satisfaction, they found that those with the lowest ratings had an average complication rate of almost 22 percent, compared to almost 19 percent for those in the top fourth.  . There was even less difference when the researchers sorted the hospitals by whether patients would recommend them to others, according to the results published in JNCI. . Patient satisfaction and surgical outcome are two different concepts, Wright told Reuters Health by email. . “This shows that satisfaction with care may not necessarily equate with high-quality care,” he said. “Certainly for patients, satisfaction and patient experience are important and a meaningful outcome.” . To bring patient ratings into alignment with care outcomes, we would need specific measures for cancer patients undergoing surgery, he said. . “Medical consumers should be aware of the limitations of available measures and what these measures actually quantitate,” he said. “Ratings should be placed into the context of other factors to help patients choose hospitals.” . It may be true that some hospitals are better at treating patients and others are better at making them comfortable.  . “My argument is they don’t need to correlate,” said Dr. Karl Bilimoria of the Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center and department of surgery at Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago. . “They offer different information,” said Bilimoria, who coauthored an editorial in the journal. . But even if they don’t predict surgical outcomes after 30 days, patient ratings are still important, he said. . Outcomes are the most important measure, he said, but patient satisfaction is important too, and patients should have access to both metrics in order to make a choice. . “We all want to make sure that when we have cancer surgery we come out the other side alive,” he said. “After you look at death and really serious complications, a lot of people would probably start to talk about how much they like their doctor, how much they understand them, how good they are at communicating.” . Many people currently choose hospitals and providers based on family and friend recommendations, he said. . “As we get better and better data about provider performance, we hope that patients will start to use that,” Bilimoria told Reuters Health. That data is available on many governmental, state and private websites, he said. . SOURCE: .  and .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - - Many people expect, or hope, that the family doctor will intervene to help take away the car keys from an unsafe older driver, but doctors and clinic staff say these are hard conversations to have and they need more resources. . “Doctors are often called on to help make decisions about driving, because they understand a person’s medical conditions and medications and how these affect driving,” but many older adults prefer to hear advice from family, friends or driving specialists, said lead author Dr. Marian E. Betz of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora. . “Ultimately, only a licensing bureau can revoke a license – but doctors, family, and others can help an older adult decide when it’s time to stop driving,” she told Reuters Health by email. . On the whole, older drivers are generally safe drivers and do not pose a menace to the community around them, she stressed. “Driving is key for mobility and independence, and driving cessation has been linked to depression and even early death,” Betz said. . Talking about stopping driving can be very emotional, which is why doctors and family members may be reluctant to bring it up, Betz said.  . “It’s also hard to talk about if there aren’t great alternatives to offer – either because there aren’t good transportation alternatives or because the doctor or family doesn’t know where to find them,” she said. . Betz and her coauthors interviewed 10 doctors, two nurses, a medical assistant, a social worker and a front-desk staffer who worked at a geriatric clinic or a general internal medicine clinic in Colorado.  . Each person talked for up to an hour about their own role in working with older drivers, experiences they have had with impaired older patients, and their recommendations on how to implement an older driver assessment in a way that would be accepted by providers and drivers. . The 15 interviewees talked most about their inadequate resources to support older drivers, a lack of education for providers and patients about driving safety and how complex their own roles are in the primary care office setting. . Providers in both clinics said they knew talking about driving safety was their responsibility, but it was not a role they enjoyed. . “I don’t know if I would say hesitant . . . I would say dread maybe,” one doctor told the researchers. “More like I know it’s important to do. I know we have to do it, but we don’t like it.” . One doctor, trained in palliative care, said he would rather have the “end of life” discussion than an end of driving discussion. Taking away driving rights can be more contentious since it involves taking away freedom and autonomy, he said. . Doctors expressed that a better sense of evidence-based recommendations would help them make decisions about how to talk to older drivers, and what to say. . The doctors were often unsure of what community resources were available for driving evaluation or rehabilitation, but they did know that those programs are usually not reimbursed by insurance. . Comprehensive driving evaluations including both in-office tests and a behind-the-wheel session on the road are available at some VA centers. . The sole social worker felt she was most informed about options for driving assessment and alternative transportation, and the doctors in both clinics considered her a key resource, the authors write in the Journal of Injury Prevention. . “As we get older we do become more prone to a variety of health concerns like dementia that can undermine your ability to safely drive a motor vehicle,” and it is the doctor’s responsibility to detect these conditions, said Dr. David Hogan, a geriatrics expert at the University of Calgary. . But that can be difficult to do, Hogan told Reuters Health by email. . “Even when a physician can evaluate the potential impact of a diagnosis in an office setting, they are not directly observing the person’s driving skills on the road, which is the most relevant issue when assessing driving safety,” he said. . Doctors may need easier access to local information, a link to a social worker, or embedded questions within electronic medical record templates to make these conversations easier, Betz said. . “Early and routine conversations about driving can help bring up the topic in a nonthreatening way and can help older adults prepare for future changes,” she said. “These conversations can happen in doctors’ offices but also around the kitchen table at home.” . “While there’s no set age when a person becomes unsafe, 65 might be a good target to start routine conversations,” Betz said. .

Emma Batha|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A British doctor accused of carrying out female genital mutilation on a new mother was acquitted on Wednesday following the country’s first FGM trial. . The doctor, Dhanuson Dharmasena, said FGM was an “abhorrent practice” and he was “extremely relieved” by the verdict. His family – weeping with relief – said he had been made a scapegoat. . The landmark trial took place amid growing public outrage over the authorities’ failure to put anyone on trial for FGM, although the practice has been illegal in Britain for 30 years. . A leading obstetrician branded the prosecution a “ludicrous” travesty of justice which would leave doctors on labor wards terrified of touching women who had been subjected to FGM.  . An estimated 137,000 women and girls in England and Wales have undergone FGM, the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, which can cause serious physical and psychological problems as well as complications in childbirth. . Despite the verdict, anti-FGM campaigners said the trial sent a strong message that FGM was against the law and that the law would in future be enforced. . The Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, later  defended her decision to bring the case to trial and said she remained determined to prosecute cases of FGM where there was enough evidence. . The case centered on whether a suture put in by Dharmasena after he delivered the woman’s baby amounted to FGM or was medically necessary. . The woman, known as AB in court, had undergone FGM as a child in Somalia, when her labia had been sewn together. . Dharmasena told London’s Southwark Crown Court he had made a 1.5-2cm cut through the fused tissue after the woman went into emergency labor at London’s Whittington Hospital on November 24, 2012. . The prosecution said he restitched her labia together after the birth, thereby performing FGM. But Dharmasena said he only put in a small suture at the top of the cut to stop bleeding. . A second defendant, Hasan Mohamed, 41, was cleared of encouraging the doctor to carry out the procedure. . His lawyer, Ali Hussain, said Mohamed believed the case was a “show trial” brought by the crown prosecution service to restore confidence after its failures over the last 30 years. . Dharmasena, who was a junior registrar at the time he delivered the baby, said he had received no medical training in FGM and had never seen a patient with FGM before AB. He had also never observed a deinfibulation - the procedure to re-open a woman who has undergone FGM. . But the 32-year-old doctor from Ilford accepted in hindsight he should have sutured the edges of the cut separately rather than sewing it together, in line with the hospital’s FGM guidelines. . Mr Justice Sweeney said Dharmasena had been “badly let down” by systemic failures at the hospital; AB was not referred to an FGM specialist during antenatal appointments and was not given a birth plan or interpreter. . Dr Katrina Erskine, a consultant obstetrician and gynecologist at London’s Homerton Hospital, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the decision to prosecute Dharmasena was “absolutely ghastly” and went against all natural justice. . “FGM is one of the most horrendous forms of child abuse … and we’ve got to do all we can to tackle it. (But) to equate what a doctor does when he has just delivered a baby with slicing off a little girl’s clitoris and labia, suturing them together and torturing her - it takes my breath away!” said Erskine, who has been dealing with the results of FGM for 30 years. . Far from helping women with FGM, the trial would put them at risk because everyone would now be “absolutely terrified of touching them”, she added. . Another obstetrician tweeted: “Right issue, right time, absolute wrong case.” . But Equality Now, which campaigns against FGM, hailed the trial as “a watershed moment” for those affected by FGM as it showed the law would be implemented. It said the case had also highlighted gaps in the system and the need for better training. . Saunders said in a statement that the Crown Prosecution Service remained determined to prosecute the ‘invidious crime’ of FGM, adding that “we do not shy away from difficult cases.” . The fact that the judge had dismissed defence applications to stop the case three times showed that he agreed that the evidence should be considered by the jury, she said.  . “Today’s verdict will not stop the important work that we and the police are doing in encouraging victims to come forward and looking at new ways to help bring cases to court,” she said. |Thu Feb 05 16:12:08 +0000 2015||British doctor acquitted in landmark FGM trial |5.63369493121237e+17|http://reut.rs/1Fa3WS0
|BOSTON (Reuters) - A western Massachusetts toddler died over the weekend after suffocating while undergoing a home treatment for head lice involving mayonnaise and a plastic bag, police said on Thursday. . Police in Springfield, about 90 miles west of Boston, responded to the 18-month-old girl’s home at about 3 p.m. on Saturday after receiving a 911 call that a child was not breathing, said department spokesman Sergeant John Delaney. Officers found an adult administering CPR to the child, but medical personnel determined that the young girl had been dead for some time, he said. . The family had put the child to bed on Friday night with mayonnaise and a plastic bag on her scalp in an attempt to treat head lice, he said. As the infant slept, the bag apparently covered her face, suffocating her. . “This is a very sad incident,” Delaney said. . No charges have been filed, but the incident is under investigation by local and state officials.  . There is little data on whether home lice treatments involving fats are effective, according to the Massachusetts Department of Health. The department recommends using prescription and non-prescription medical shampoos. .

Tova Cohen|CAESAREA, Israel (Reuters) - One of Israel’s best performing stocks in the last year isn’t a cybersecurity start-up or a high-tech chipmaker but a firm whose products promise to reduce wrinkles and treat acne. . Shares in EndyMed, which makes devices that use radio waves to rejuvenate skin, have surged 90 percent in the past year, with demand soaring following approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its latest product. . So far in 2015, the shares are up 49 percent, against a 5.7 percent rise in Tel Aviv’s biomedical index, which includes biotech, medical device and life sciences companies.  . While the company’s annual sales currently stand at only around $10 million, they are growing by 50 percent a year, with consumers’ desire for home-based treatments underpinning growth. . The global dermatology devices market is expected to double in the coming years, according to researchers MarketsandMarkets, expanding to $11.3 billion by 2019 from $6.6 billion in 2014. . Within the sector, home beauty devices are a growing component and one in which many cosmetics companies, including giants like L’Oreal, are trying to secure a stake. . EndyMed, which until recently focused on larger professional systems to treat wrinkles or acne in specialist medical clinics and spas, has now developed a home-use device called Newa. . The technology involves injecting heat into the skin’s middle layer to help rebuild collagen. . Critical to EndyMed’s growth was the 2013 approval by the FDA for the sale of its home device with a doctor’s prescription. It is now seeking approval to sell them over the counter. It already has European Union approval to sell direct to consumers. . As well as Europe and the United States, Asia is a key market, especially China. A distributor of EndyMed’s professional devices in China, OHMK Medical Technology, has now bought 29 percent of the firm. . “The potential is huge,” EndyMed Chief Executive Elad Magal said of the sector. “We are not L’Oreal, but if we do it right, the potential is there.”     |Thu Feb 05 13:11:52 +0000 2015||Israel's EndyMed a top stock on FDA wrinkle treatment approval |5.6332412839737754e+17|http://reut.rs/1F9n2rr
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dr. Margaret Hamburg, who as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost six years has overseen public health initiatives ranging from tobacco control and food safety to personalized medicine and drug approvals, is stepping down, the agency said on Thursday. . Hamburg, one of the longest-serving FDA commissioners in the modern era, told Reuters in an interview that her decision was prompted by the heavy demands of the job and the sheer length of time she has held the position. . “This is a very challenging job full of opportunities to make a huge and enduring difference,” she said, “but it is 24/7 and there are really really difficult decisions to make.”       . The 59-year-old, nominated by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in May 2009, was last year named the world’s 51st most powerful woman by Forbes magazine. . Hamburg’s resignation comes at a crucial time for the FDA as Congress pushes initiatives to speed new drug development, and food safety advocates, backed by Obama, back the creation of a separate agency combining the food safety functions of the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. . Under Hamburg, the agency introduced multiple measures to speed new products to the market. In 2014, the FDA approved 51 new therapies, the most in almost 20 years. In a blog post on Wednesday, Hamburg called the achievement “a testament ... to FDA’s innovative approaches to help expedite development and review of medical products that target unmet medical needs.” . A spokesman for the White House, Josh Earnest, told reporters at a briefing that Obama’s nomination to replace Hamburg would have impeccable scientific credentials and merit bipartisan support. The nominee must be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. . Late last month, the agency named Dr. Robert Califf, a prominent cardiologist and researcher from Duke University, to oversee its drug, medical device and tobacco policy. Califf is viewed by many as a potential successor to Hamburg, whose resignation takes effect in March. . Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the FDA’s chief scientist, will fill Hamburg’s position until a new commissioner is named. . A long-time public health official with extensive experience fighting AIDS and tuberculosis, Hamburg, who graduated from Harvard Medical School, previously served at the National Institutes of Health before becoming New York City’s health commissioner. That public health focus endeared her to patient advocates. . “Commissioner Hamburg, from day one, has been committed to being a champion for patients,” said Ellen Sigal, founder and chair of Friends of Cancer Research. “She has fostered the growth of science and innovation across the agency and really changed how FDA and industry collaborate.” . Under Hamburg, the FDA, which oversees products representing more than 20 cents of every dollar spent by U.S. consumers, has proposed measures to improve nutrition by limiting dangerous trans-fats in food and requiring restaurants to post calorie counts on menus. It also has beefed up inspections of food and drugs from overseas. . “She really had an active and visible role on the global stage not only from a medical products perspective but from a food safety perspective,” said Erica Jefferson, former acting assistant commissioner for media affairs. .  During her tenure the FDA has confronted major public health issues, including the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the abuse of opioid painkillers, the emergence of electronic cigarettes and the outbreak of Ebola and other infectious diseases. . Her ride has not always been smooth. She faced hostile questioning by Republicans in Congress following a fungal meningitis outbreak in 2012 that killed dozens of people and sickened hundreds more.  . In 2011, then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled the FDA’s decision to allow an emergency contraceptive known as Plan B to be sold over the counter to young teenagers. Hamburg insisted Plan B was safe for use and it was approved two years later. . Hamburg, whose mother was the first African-American woman to earn a degree from Yale University School of Medicine, was never a crusading commissioner in the way of one of her predecessors, Dr. David Kessler, who fought to bring tobacco under FDA regulation. The FDA eventually gained authority over tobacco in 2009. . Hamburg’s tenure has disappointed some drug watchdogs, who say the FDA has too often succumbed to industry pressure. . “Throughout Hamburg’s tenure, the FDA has grown even more cozy with the industries that it regulates,” Public Citizen said in a statement. . Yet it was Hamburg who, in 2011, revoked approval for Roche Holding AG’sROG.VX drug Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer after the company failed to prove that the benefits outweighed the risks. The drug remains on the market for certain types of colon, lung, kidney and brain cancer. . And she began a crackdown on poor-quality generic drugs and drug ingredients from India, China and elsewhere.     |Thu Feb 05 06:51:21 +0000 2015||Exclusive: U.S. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg to step down - source |5.6322836784010445e+17|http://reut.rs/1AuM0mr
Christina  Farr|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s (. ) healthcare technology is spreading quickly among major U.S. hospitals, showing early promise as a way for  doctors to monitor patients remotely and lower costs. . Fourteen of 23 top hospitals contacted by Reuters said they have rolled out a pilot program of Apple’s HealthKit service - which acts as a repository for patient-generated health information like blood pressure, weight or heart rate - or are in talks to do so.  . The pilots aim to help physicians monitor patients with such chronic conditions as diabetes and hypertension. Apple rivals Google Inc (. ) and Samsung Electronics (. ), which have released similar services, are only just starting to reach out to hospitals and other medical partners. . Such systems hold the promise of allowing doctors to watch for early signs of trouble and intervene before a medical problem becomes acute. That could help hospitals avoid repeat admissions, for which they are penalized under new U.S. government guidelines, all at a relatively low cost. . The U.S. healthcare market is $3 trillion, and researcher IDC Health Insights predicts that 70 percent of healthcare organizations worldwide will invest by 2018 in technology including apps, wearables, remote monitoring and virtual care. . Those trying out Apple’s service included at least eight of the 17 hospitals on one list ranking the best hospitals, the U.S. News & World Report’s Honor Roll. Google and Samsung had started discussions with just a few of these hospitals. . Apple’s HealthKit works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools, food and exercise-tracking apps and Wi-fi connected scales. The company’s Apple Watch, due for release in April, promises to add to the range of possible data, which with patients’ consent can be sent to an electronic medical record for doctors to view. . Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans has been working with Apple and Epic Systems, Ochsner’s medical records vendor, to roll out a pilot program for high-risk patients. The team is already tracking several hundred patients who are struggling to control their blood pressure. The devices measure blood pressure and other statistics and send it to Apple phones and tablets. . “If we had more data, like daily weights, we could give the patient a call before they need to be hospitalized,” said Chief Clinical Transformation Officer Dr. Richard Milani.  . Sumit Rana, chief technology officer at Epic Systems, said the timing was right for mobile health tech to take off. . “We didn’t have smartphones ten years ago; or an explosion of new sensors and devices,” Rana said. . Apple has said that over 600 developers are integrating HealthKit into their health and fitness apps.  . Many of the hospitals told Reuters they were eager to try pilots of the Google Fit service, since Google’s Android software powers most smartphones. Google said it has several developer partners on board for Fit, which connects to apps and devices, but did not comment on its outreach to hospitals. . Samsung said it is working with Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital to develop mobile health technology. The firm also has a relationship with the University of California’s San Francisco Medical Center. . Apple’s move into mobile health tech comes as the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform efforts aim to provide incentives for doctors to keep patients healthy. The aim is to move away from the “fee for service” model, which has tended to reward doctors for pricey procedures rather than for outcomes. . Still, hospitals must decide whether the difficulty of sorting through a deluge of patient-generated data of varying quality is worth the investment. . “This is a whole new data source that we don’t understand the integrity of yet,” said William Hanson, chief medical information officer at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. . Apple has recruited informal industry advisors, including Rana and John Halamka, chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, to discuss health data privacy and for introductions to the industry. . The company said it had an “incredible team” of experts in health and fitness and was talking to medical institutions, healthcare and industry experts on ways to deliver its services. . A few hospitals are also exploring how to manage the data that is flowing in from health and fitness-concerned patients, whom many in Silicon Valley refer to as the “worried well.”  . Beth Israel’s Halamka said that many of the 250,000 patients in his system had data from sources such as Jawbone’s Up activity tracker and wirelessly connected scales.  . “Can I interface to every possible device that every patient uses? No. But Apple can,” he said. . Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles is developing visual dashboards to present patient-generated data to doctors in an easy-to-digest manner. . Experts say that there will eventually be a need for common standards to ensure that data can be gathered from both Apple’s system and its competitors. . “How do we get Apple to work with Samsung? I think it will be a problem eventually,” said Brian Carter, a director focused on personal and population health at Cerner, an electronic medical record vendor that is integrated with HealthKit.  |Thu Feb 05 06:51:21 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Apple's health tech takes early lead among top hospitals |5.632283660323553e+17|http://reut.rs/1F8pgYj
Alex Dobuzinskis|(Reuters) - Daily marijuana use is not associated with brain shrinkage when using a like-for-like method to control for the effects of alcohol consumption on those who both drink and toke up, a new study from Colorado has found.  . The study, led by neuroscientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder and published Jan. 28 in the Journal of Neuroscience, points to continued uncertainty about how pot use alters the structure of the brain. Even so, other studies have found the drug has short-term effects on learning and memory. . The latest research comes as access to pot is expanding following 2012 ballot measures in Washington state and Colorado that legalized its recreational use, and voter-approved measures last year to do the same in Alaska and Oregon. The drug remains illegal under federal law. . “So far, there’s not a lot of evidence to suggest that you have these gross volume changes” in the brain due to marijuana use, said Kent Hutchison, a clinical neuroscientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the senior author of the study. . In particular, his study examined a paper released last year by researchers at Northwestern University that identified changes to the nucleus accumbens and the nucleus amygdala, regions of the brain that are key to regulating emotion and motivation, in marijuana users who smoke one to seven joints a week.  . Hutchison’s team said they tried to replicate those results by recruiting dozens of adults and adolescents and conducting brain imaging on them, and comparing daily pot users to non-users. But Hutchison said they took a different approach to rule out the effects of alcohol. . They closely matched daily pot users with non-users based on their alcohol consumption, to compare people who drank similar amounts, in what researchers believed would best eliminate the influence of alcohol, Hutchison said.    . “We found no evidence of differences in volumes of the accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus or cerebellum between daily versus non-users, in adults or adolescents,” Hutchison’s paper said, referring to parts of the brain. . Anne Blood, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who worked on the study released last year by Northwestern University, said the latest research failed to properly replicate her team’s work because it did not include a healthy, non-substance abusing control group. . Also, Blood said her team found effects of marijuana use on the brain correlated to how much of the drug participants used, demonstrating a link. |Thu Feb 05 06:03:55 +0000 2015||Daily pot use not associated with brain shrinkage: Colorado study |5.6321642915640934e+17|http://reut.rs/1AuHkgb
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Responding to an outbreak of measles that has infected more than 100 people, two California lawmakers said on Wednesday they would introduce legislation to end the right of parents in the state to exempt their children from school vaccinations based on personal beliefs. . California public health officials say 92 people have been diagnosed with measles in the state, many of them linked to an outbreak that they believe began when an infected person from outside the country visited Disneyland in late December. . More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico, renewing a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked science, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated. . “The high number of unvaccinated students is jeopardizing public health not only in schools but in the broader community.  We need to take steps to keep our schools safe and our students healthy,” state Senator Ben Allen said in a written statement announcing the legislation he is co-sponsoring with fellow Democrat Richard Pan. . The measure would make California the 33rd state to bar parents from opting out of vaccinations based on personal beliefs. . Also on Wednesday, a top Los Angeles County health official said that a total of 21 cases have been recorded in the county but that after the initial wave of reports, the number has fallen to four in the latest two-week period.  . “We’re getting to a number of cases that’s manageable, and I’m hopeful that within weeks or a couple of months we will be able to turn the corner on this particular outbreak,” Interim Health Officer Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser told a press conference, although he cautioned that a lag in reporting could still add a few more cases. . A day care center at a high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica closed earlier this week and more than a dozen infants placed under a three-week quarantine after a baby enrolled in the program was diagnosed with measles. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the nation had its highest number of measles cases in two decades. . Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. |Thu Feb 05 00:15:05 +0000 2015||California lawmakers seek to end 'personal belief' vaccine exemptions |5.631286446554071e+17|http://reut.rs/1F7wNq4
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - A global fund should be created to speed development of new antibiotics to counter the growing threat of drug-resistant superbugs, a review backed by the British government said on Thursday. . The review, headed by leading economist and former Goldman Sachs chief Jim O’Neill, said far too little was currently invested in research that could lead to new drugs to fight drug-resistant bacterial and viral infections. . “A lot of innovative thinking is happening in infectious disease research at the moment. These bright ideas need to be developed,” the report said. “But lack of funding means that while people, machines and laboratories are ready to tackle the next challenges, they are unable to do so.” . The problem of infectious bugs becoming drug-resistant has been a feature of medicine since the discovery of the first antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928. But it has grown in recent years as bugs resistant to multiple drugs have developed and drugmakers have cut back investment in this field. . The World Health Organization has warned that unless something drastic is done, many antibiotics could become redundant this century, leaving patients vulnerable to deadly infections, particularly during operations. . Commenting on O’Neill’s review and the issue of drug-resistance, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity warned: “This is more than a medical problem: it is a potential economic disaster.” . “Multi-drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, E. coli, and salmonella are now commonplace. Most gonorrhoea infections are untreatable,” he said. “Superbugs like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile are proliferating. In India, antibiotic-resistant infections killed more than 58,000 newborns in 2013.” . O’Neill, who was asked last year by Britain’s prime minister to take an economist’s view of the issue, said in his first report that so-called anti-microbial resistance (AMR) could kill an extra 10 million people a year and cost up to $100 trillion by 2050 if it was not brought under control. . In this latest report, O’Neill called on international funders, both philanthropists and governments, to allocate money to a fund “to support blue sky science and incubate ideas that are more mature”. . When it comes to research funding, the report said infectious diseases were a “poor relation” compared to chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and dementia. . It said a targeted “innovation fund” could support research to pave the way for new drugs, for alternatives to antibiotics and for new testing technology to ensure the right drugs were used. |Thu Feb 05 00:15:05 +0000 2015||Review calls for global fund to fight dangerous superbugs |5.631286427260068e+17|http://reut.rs/1AtZVci

Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. |Wed Feb 04 23:07:29 +0000 2015||California lawmakers seek to end 'personal belief' vaccine exemptions |5.631116300963144e+17|http://reut.rs/1F7lgat
Gene Emery|A new study finds that an experimental device implanted in the heart can relieve the chest pain of heart disease in people who aren’t candidates for stents or surgery.  . Instead of opening up a blood vessel, the novel device narrows it.  . It’s called the Reducer, and it restricts the flow of blood leaving the heart, causing blood to back up into areas of the heart muscle that aren’t getting enough nourishment, which relieves the angina. . In a small test published in the New England Journal of Medicine, more than a third of 52 angina patients found major relief six months after the reducer was implanted, compared to 15 percent of 52 volunteers who underwent a fake implantation procedure. . In an editorial, Drs. Christopher Granger of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, and Bernard Gersh of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that if the results are confirmed in larger trials, the technique “may be a welcome and needed addition to the options to improve the quality of life of patients with refractory angina.” . All the patients had previously failed to get relief with drug therapy. Most had already been treated with stents or bypass surgery. . “These patients have chest pain in every minor physical activity and they don’t have any other options for treatment,” the study’s senior author Dr. Shmuel Banai of the Tel Aviv Medical Center in Israel told Reuters Health. “I had a patient who had angina with minimal effort. Today he is an instructor of classical dance. It really makes a difference. It may not prolong life, but it really improves quality of life.” . But that example may not be typical. . Overall, there was no significant improvement in the amount of time that device recipients could exercise, a key yardstick for measuring the debilitating effects of angina. In the device group, exercise time, which averaged 7 minutes 21 seconds before implantation, increased by only 59 seconds. In the control group, it rose by just 4 seconds.  . The device is made of stainless steel mesh, like early stents. But in this case, once expanded in the blood vessel the device assumes the shape of an hour glass.  . Eventually, tissue from the wall of the blood vessel grows over the mesh, leaving only a narrow passage in the center. That shape constricts the flow of blood leaving the heart muscle.. . “Right after implantation, nothing happens,” said Banai. “If you ask the patient two or three weeks after implantation, he doesn’t see any improvement. Then, after a month or six weeks, after the mesh is covered with tissue, there is a pressure gradient. Then it becomes beneficial and improves symptoms.” . “This is a simple procedure. Implantation takes 10 to 20 minutes. The patient goes home the same day. A month or two after implantation, their quality of life is markedly improved,” he said. . Success was judged by a four-point scale of angina symptoms that assessed whether the degree to which a person’s physical activity was limited because of chest pain. While only 15 percent of those getting fake surgery improved by 2 points on the scale, 35 percent of the reducer recipients did. . When success was measured by an improvement of 1 point, 71 percent of the people who got the device improved versus 42 percent in the fake-treatment group. . A high rate of success in the sham treatment group was expected, Banai said. . “These chronic, no-option patients are very eager to believe they feel better, and some of that is in the brain,” he said. “We anticipated about 30 percent (improvement with sham therapy). We got more than 40 percent, which is a bit surprising. Yet despite this huge placebo effect, the fact that the study was positive was amazing. This means the device is really effective.”  . The study was financed by Neovasc Inc., which makes the device. It has been approved for use in the European Union but is not yet for sale. It has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . Dr. Elliott Antman, a senior physician in the Cardiovascular Division of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who was not connected with the study, advised caution. . “It is important to realize that the results of this small study are preliminary and depend heavily on the subjective report of relief of discomfort by the study subjects.” he told Reuters Health in an email.  . Before thinking about using the device in patients, Antman said, doctors need to know more about how it works and its longterm safety. . SOURCE: .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . A national survey of U.S. middle and high school students finds that those who use tobacco or nicotine products are likely to also use more than one type of product. . About 15 percent of the adolescents reported smoking cigarettes, cigars, pipes, bidis, hookahs or water pipes, using dissolvable forms of tobacco or “vaping” e-cigarettes. And twice as many in that group used two or more of these product types compared to those who said they used only one. . “Our study really shows that kids are using more than one of these products at the same time,” said Youn Ok Lee of RTI International in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, the report’s lead author. . Lee said there are many varieties of tobacco products available. And each type of product also has a diverse range of options, such as flavors. . “So we don’t really know a lot about how this range of products might affect kids’ use of tobacco,” she told Reuters Health. . Using data from a 2012 national survey of nearly 25,000 U.S. students, researchers found that about 7 percent reported using one tobacco product in the past 30 days. About 4 percent said they used two tobacco products in that time. Another 4 percent said they used three or more products. . “I was a little bit surprised by just how many kids were using more than one product,” Lee said. “Even more surprising was that using three or more products is more popular than using cigarettes alone.” . Overall, about 3 percent of kids exclusively used cigarettes and about 2 percent exclusively used cigars. Those products were the most popular and their use increased with age. . The study team also found that almost 1 percent of students reported exclusively using e-cigarettes, which contain no tobacco but deliver a vapor laced with nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco. . That’s more than the 0.4 percent who reported using e-cigarettes in combination with traditional cigarettes. . The increasing popularity of e-cigarettes is a concern for U.S. health officials as use has tripled between 2013 and 2014 (see Reuters story of November 13, 2014 here: . ). . Lee noted that the results don’t tell why young people are using more than one form of tobacco, or how often the survey participants had used the products. . The researchers did find that being a boy, using flavored products, being dependent on nicotine, being receptive to advertising and having friends who used any tobacco products were all factors linked to an increased risk of using more than one product. . Policymakers and researchers should look at how these products affect tobacco use among middle and high school students, said Lee, because little is known about the influence of non-cigarette products. . Moreover, these products may create a public health issue by introducing people who would never have smoked cigarettes to nicotine, she said. . Lee emphasized that it’s important to look at all tobacco products together – not individually. . SOURCE: .

Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - An internal investigation of an Ebola incident at a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in December found that samples sent to a lower-security lab were “unlikely” to have contained live virus and posed no threat to staff, the CDC said on Wednesday. . The close call followed mishaps involving anthrax and a deadly strain of bird flu, raising questions about how the agency handles the world’s deadliest pathogens. . CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the agency had made “real progress” to improve safety, “but we have more to do.”  . The report found that on Dec. 22, a scientist working with Ebola, which in 2014 caused the worst recorded outbreak in West Africa, inadvertently transferred a small amount of virus from a high-biosecurity lab to a lower-biosecurity one not authorized to handle live Ebola. . A chief cause of the breach, the investigation concluded, was the “lack of a written study plan,” a document that outlines specific steps to be followed in an experiment. The report also noted a failure to design the study to minimize the possibility of human error. . “That concerned me,” said Scott Becker of the‎ Association of Public Health Laboratories. “I thought that was one of the issues they uncovered after the first lab incident.” . According to the report, the scientist placed Ebola into two sets of tubes, one to inactivate it and another to merely isolate it. The tubes were identical except for a blue cap and label on one. But the caps had been removed, leaving no visual cue as to which was which, and the wrong tubes were sent to the lower-biosecurity lab down the hall. . CDC scientist Michael Shaw said most labs have adopted a  material transfer certification, in which two scientists have to certify that pathogens were inactivated before they leave the lab. But the Ebola lab, which has been swamped by the West African outbreak, had not adopted it for internal transfers. . “It was a mistake. They were mortified when they discovered it had happened,” Shaw said.  . The report also took CDC to task for “lack of project oversight,” noting the deadly-pathogens lab lacks a full-time manager. . The CDC said it is looking into changes to prevent further incidents, such as using colored liquids and different-sized containers to differentiate live from killed pathogens. . CDC last month said it installed surveillance cameras to ensure procedures are performed correctly. |Wed Feb 04 20:54:58 +0000 2015||Ebola virus sent out of high-security lab was likely dead: CDC |5.63078280145023e+17|http://reut.rs/1F6XBXs
Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - Merck & Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators intend to rescind the “breakthrough therapy” designation for its  combination treatment for hepatitis C because other new drugs are available, a decision that could delay approval of the Merck product by several months. . The Food and Drug Administration gives the designation to medicines it deems likely to demonstrate “substantial improvement” over existing drugs. The designation has hastened approval of some drugs by two to three months. .  Analysts said Merck’s two-drug treatment would likely now require a standard 10-month review. . Merck, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, said it plans to discuss the matter with the FDA and still expects to seek U.S. approval in the first half of 2015. The treatment consists of a protease inhibitor called MK-5172 and a so-called NS5A inhibitor called MK-8742 that together had received the FDA’s “breakthrough therapy” designation. .  In a recent mid-stage trial, Merck’s combo cured 98 percent of previously untreated patients with genotype 1, the most common and hardest to treat variant of hepatitis C. Merck said late-stage trials are now complete, and will support approval. . “Based upon data today, we believe we will be able to compete in the marketplace,” Adam Schechter, head of global human health for Merck, said in an interview.The setback for Merck follows recent approvals of costly oral treatments for the liver disease from Gilead Sciences Inc and AbbVie Inc that have wiped out all signs of the virus in well over 90 percent of patients after eight or 12 weeks. . “The breakthrough therapy designation is meant for drugs that address an unmet medical need, but we now have two virtual cures for hepatitis C on the market” from Gilead and AbbVie, said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans. . Evans said Merck’s combination treatment will likely undergo a standard FDA review. She predicted, however, that Merck’s array of experimental hepatitis C drugs will eventually claim a 15 to 20 percent global market share, with annual sales in the billions of dollars. . Shares of the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker fell 3.5 percent on Wednesday, also hurt by a weaker-than-expected profit forecast for 2015 which the company blamed on the stronger dollar. .  In the face of such potent rival hepatitis C medicines, Merck in June announced it would ramp up its involvement in the lucrative field by buying Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc for $3.85 billion and combining the two companies’ most promising drugs to produce a faster, more effective cure.           . Idenix had three hepatitis C drugs in development, most notably a pill in early-stage trials called IDX21437, which Merck has renamed MK-3682. Like Gilead’s Sovaldi, it is a nucleotide inhibitor, or “nuc,” that blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. . Merck is conducting a mid-stage trial to study combinations of MK-3682 and MK-5172 (grazoprevir) with either MK-8742 (elbasvir) or another drug called MK-8408. It hopes to begin larger late-stage trials of the triplet therapies this year. . Gilead introduced Sovaldi in late 2013 at a cost of $1,000 a pill, and reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.73 billion for the drug. Gilead later introduced Harvoni, a pill combining Sovaldi with another treatment, and it captured sales of $2.11 billion in the quarter. . AbbVie launched its Viekira Pak treatment late last year. Since then, it has battled Gilead for market share by offering discounts to insurers and other group payers. . Late on Tuesday, Gilead disclosed that its discounts will average 46 percent this year, up sharply from analyst expectations of 25 to 30 percent. Shares of Gilead and AbbVie both tumbled after the news. . As many as 3.2 million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can lead to severe liver disease. . Merck on Wednesday reported slightly disappointing fourth-quarter sales and predicted 2015 earnings below analyst forecasts. It cited the negative impact of the stronger dollar, as most of its U.S. rivals have done in their own cautious forecasts.   |Wed Feb 04 20:05:37 +0000 2015||"Merck says hepatitis C treatment to lose ""breakthrough"" status "|5.6306586307159654e+17|http://reut.rs/1AtfhO6
|(Reuters) - Nearly 7.5 million people have signed up for 2015 Obamacare health plans through HealthCare.gov with demand increasing as the Feb. 15 enrollment deadline approaches, a senior U.S. health official said on Wednesday. . The two top states for sign-ups were Florida, with 1.34 million people having selected plans as of Jan. 30, and Texas, with 969,461 plans.  . “As we build towards Feb. 15, we are beginning to see a ramp. We are starting to see more and more activity in the call center and more and more activity on the website,” Andy Slavitt, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters. .  Consumers surged to the site in December ahead of the deadline for Jan. 1 coverage and Slavitt said the call center will be fully staffed as of Monday in anticipation of another round of latecomers. After Feb. 15, only people with certain exceptions will be eligible to buy plans. . Enrollment for individual plans, created as part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, opened for their second year of coverage on Nov. 15.  . They are sold on the government’s HealthCare.gov website for 37 states. The other 13 states plus Washington D.C. run their own websites. Recent data showed that another 2.4 million people selected a plan or were automatically enrolled in those other markets. That data is through Jan. 18 for California and through Jan. 17 elsewhere.  . In the first year, around 7 million people signed up for the new individual plans. So far, the combined number for 2015 is nearly 9.9 million. . The government has set a target calling for 9.1 million people to be enrolled and up to date on premium payments by the end of 2015. |Wed Feb 04 19:49:40 +0000 2015||Government says 7.5 million selected 2015 Obamacare plans so far |5.630618484432118e+17|http://reut.rs/1AtchBw
Randi Belisomo|Among dying hospice patients, hearing problems are often overlooked, but shouldn’t be, experts say.Families and physicians frequently mistake hearing loss for dementia among the elderly and terminally ill, said Barbara Weinstein, a professor of audiology at the City University of New York. . The Institute of Medicine’s recent report, Dying in America, outlined core components of quality end-of-life care, many of which are tied to patients’ ability to listen and communicate: patient counseling; distress management; attention to social, cultural and religious needs and assessment of physical and emotional well-being.  . But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 80 percent of Americans age 85 and older have hearing impairments. And Medicare and the Medicare Hospice Benefit do not cover hearing aids, which can cost between $1600 and $3500 each.  . Hospices might be able to work “with resources in the community if there was a patient with a need for hearing aids,” said Judi Lund Person, Vice-President of Regulatory Affairs for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. . Athens, Ohio-based audiologist Bethany Gonczy started one such community program within her Diles Hearing Center to loan hearing aids to hospice patients. She saw a need after treating cancer patients who lost hearing due to chemotherapy or pain regimens.  . “They can have relationships with their family,” Gonczy said. “Those relationships at the end of life are more important than ever. They are able to communicate with their kids and grandkids.” . When a patient dies, the family returns the hearing aid for reuse.  . “For people we have helped, it has made a huge difference in their life,” she said.  . Steven Murphy, Executive Director of Hearing Charities of America, said too few community resources like Gonczy’s exist. His organization maintains a list of philanthropic programs that help those who cannot afford hearing aids. In 2014, Hearing Charities backed the launch of the “New Jersey Hearing Aid Project,” which donated one hundred hearing aids in its first year.  . “The impact is significant,” Murphy said. He would like physicians treating older patients to encourage screening earlier. If hearing loss is not recognized until the final stages of illness, it is often too late to receive help. . “This problem will not be solved by any one organization,” he said. “It will require input by government, the industry and other charities.” . Lise Hamlin, the Director of Public Policy for the Hearing Loss Association of America, said the problem will linger as long as Medicare coverage excludes hearing devices. She points out that federal employees may choose insurance plans with hearing coverage, and she said all Americans should enjoy the same luxury.  . “We would like to see better solutions,” Hamlin said. . In the meantime, Weinstein advises, caregivers should frequently inquire if a patient hears what was said. . Most hard-of-hearing patients can be engaged in conversation with a personal sound amplifier and stereo headset that costs a little more than a hundred dollars, Weinstein said. She advises doctors, particularly palliative care specialists, to keep such a device in their pocket. . “A lot of people at the end of life have been marginalized” because they can’t hear, Weinstein said. “They may appear confused or cognitively deprived, but it is because they have not been included in the conversation.” . “It’s easier not to communicate with someone with hearing loss, especially at that stage,” said Weinstein. “But it is not justifiable, especially when there are options.” |Wed Feb 04 19:36:17 +0000 2015||Hearing loss an oft-overlooked problem for hospice patients |5.630584806268068e+17|http://reut.rs/1F6IddM
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A $34 device that plugs into the audio jack of a smartphone was nearly as effective as far more costly diagnostic blood testing equipment in identifying antibodies for HIV and syphilis in a pilot study in Africa, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday. . The mobile lab device, known as a dongle, cost $34 to make, compared with more than $18,000 for the gold standard diagnostic equipment. In a pilot study, the device performed all of the mechanical, optical and electronic functions of a lab-based blood test in 15 minutes, using only power drawn from the smartphone. . It was developed by a team lead by Samuel Sia, an associate professor at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University in New York. . To test its effectiveness, health care workers in Rwanda used the tool to do finger-prick blood tests on 96 patients, including women who were at risk of passing sexually transmitted diseases to their unborn children. . The team compared the results with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA testing, and found the results were nearly as accurate. The test has a sensitivity of 92 to 100 percent, a measurement of how often the tests accurately identified the target antibodies, and it had a specificity of 79 to 100 percent, an indicator of how well the test did at ruling out people who were not infected.  . “Our work shows that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory,” Sia said in a statement. . The researchers estimate that with syphilis, a test with only 70 to 80 percent sensitivity and specificity that was performed at the point of care could reduce deaths tenfold compared with a perfectly accurate lab-based test, because the non-lab test would be more likely to increase syphilis diagnosis. . The study was backed by a grant from the Gates Foundation and several other funders and published on Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. . The researchers are planning a larger-scale clinical trial with the goal of winning approval by the World Health Organization for use in developing countries. |Wed Feb 04 19:36:17 +0000 2015||Could a $34 smartphone device improve HIV diagnosis in Africa? |5.630584786345206e+17|http://reut.rs/1At9CYz
Gary Robertson|RICHMOND, Va.

The school in Farmville, Virginia, had canceled classes on Jan. 29 after the highly contagious virus, which can cause diarrhea and vomiting for up to 48 hours, broke out. . “To my knowledge we have not before had an outbreak of any illness which required canceling classes,” said college spokesman Thomas Shomo. . The school has cleaned and disinfected classrooms, residence and fraternity halls and dining facilities to eliminate the virus. . Dr. Alexander Samuel, the state health director for the area, said the source of norovirus was unclear. . About three dozen cases also have been reported at Longwood University, a school with 4,800 students in Farmville, a Longwood spokesman said. . Norovirus was blamed in November for making guests at a California hotel and passengers aboard a cruise ship fall ill. . Norovirus is the most common cause of contagious . gastrointestinal illness.

Brendan Pierson|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of doctors and patients, some terminally ill, on Wednesday asked a New York court to rule that doctor-assisted suicide is not against state law. . The lawsuit, filed against New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in Manhattan Supreme Court, claimed that a New York law making it a crime to cause or aid another person to commit suicide does not apply to doctors who prescribe fatal drugs to mentally competent, terminally ill patients who ask for them. . Three of the doctors in the case - Timothy Quill, Samuel Klagsbrun and Howard Grossman - were also plaintiffs in a 1997 case before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the New York assisted-suicide law under the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled against them. All three have been prominent advocates for doctor-assisted suicide, which advocates prefer to call aid-in dying. . One of the patients in the lawsuit, Eric Seiff, 81, is a former Manhattan assistant district attorney who is being treated for cancer. . Seiff is not currently terminally ill, but the other two patients are. Sara Myers, 60, has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, and Steve Goldenberg, 55, has multiple HIV-related illnesses. Both told a news conference that they do not yet want to die but want to have the choice in the future. . Nurse and end-of life consultant Judith Schwarz, Charles Thornton, a Rochester, New York, neurologist, and non-profit End of Life Choices New York are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. . The plaintiffs say in the lawsuit that the state’s law against assisted suicide was never meant to apply to doctors helping mentally competent, terminally ill patients. They said helping such patients die was not assisted suicide but rather akin to withdrawing a patient from a ventilator. . Even if the law was meant to prohibit doctor-assisted suicide, they said, the court should rule that enforcing it violates patients’ due process and equal protection rights under the state Constitution. . Besides Schneiderman, the lawsuit named the district attorneys of Westchester, Monroe, Saratoga, Bronx and New York counties, where the plaintiffs live or practice medicine. . Schneiderman’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth DeBold, declined to comment. . Oregon, Washington and Vermont are currently the only states with laws explicitly allowing doctor-assisted suicide, and  California’s legislature is considering a similar law. A New Mexico judge has ruled in favor of doctor-assisted suicide, though the ruling is being appealed.  . The case is Myers et al v. Schneiderman et al, New York Supreme Court, New York County. |Wed Feb 04 18:49:00 +0000 2015||Lawsuit asks court to allow doctor-assisted suicide in New York |5.630465819106509e+17|http://reut.rs/1At0yCM
Ian Simpson|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States’ top doctor said that medical marijuana can help some patients in comments on Wednesday that may boost pressure on the Justice Department to redesignate the drug under federal law. . In an interview on “CBS This Morning,” U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said the medical effectiveness of marijuana had to be shown scientifically and much more information about it was coming. . “We have some preliminary data showing that for certain medical conditions and symptoms, marijuana can be helpful,” said Murthy, who became surgeon general in December. . “I think we have to use that data to drive policymaking, and I’m very interested to see where that data takes us.” . The Justice Department designates marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, a category for drugs that have no accepted medical value and have a high potential for abuse. . Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana, according to the Drug Policy Alliance advocacy group. . Florida also allows a narrow use of medical marijuana. Two states, Washington and Colorado, have legalized marijuana for recreational use. . Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, another advocacy group, said in a statement that Murthy’s remarks mean that President Barack Obama should direct Attorney General Eric Holder to begin changing how the department categorizes marijuana. . “Dr. Murthy’s comments add to a growing consensus in the medical community that marijuana can help people suffering from painful conditions,” Angell said. . The Justice Department had no immediate response to Murthy’s comments. |Wed Feb 04 18:49:00 +0000 2015||Top U.S. doctor says medical marijuana may help some conditions |5.63046579834454e+17|http://reut.rs/1F6znwI
Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - The number of new cases of Ebola rose in all three of West Africa’s worst-hit countries last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday, ending several weeks of encouraging declines across the region. . Suspicion of aid workers, especially in Guinea, and unsafe local practices were continuing to hamper efforts to halt the deadly virus, the United Nations agency said. . “An unsafe burial that took place in early January in the (Guinean) eastern prefecture of Lola, on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, has so far resulted in an outbreak of 11 confirmed cases,” it said. Investigators had been initially rebuffed by the local population, it added. . Mourners have caught the haemorrhagic disease in the past by touching the highly-contagious bodies of dead loved ones, sometimes by laying hands on them to say goodbye.  . The WHO said a week ago that there had been 99 confirmed cases in the week to Jan. 25, the lowest tally since June 2014, raising hopes that the tide might have turned.   . But its new figures, for the week ending Feb. 1, showed the first recorded rise in new cases across all three countries this year. . Sierra Leone, the worst hotspot, accounted for 80 of the 124 new cases of the disease, Guinea recorded 39 while Liberia had just five, all near the capital Monrovia, the report said. . Nearly one third of Guinea’s 34 prefectures had reported at least one security incident or other form of refusal to cooperate with health workers in the previous week. . Villagers are often alarmed by the approach of aid workers wearing space-age protective equipment and have resisted efforts to find cases, isolate those infected and chlorinate homes. . Meetings were planned between authorities from Guinea, Mali and Senegal to strengthen disease surveillance, the WHO said. A rapid response team has deployed in the border area with Ivory Coast, it added. . The WHO said there was an urgent need to step up efforts before the start of the April-May rainy season, when downpours can block roads and make it difficult for health teams to travel. . In all, 8,981 people have died of Ebola out of 22,495 known cases in nine countries since the outbreak began in December 2013, according to the agency. |Wed Feb 04 18:32:49 +0000 2015||Ebola cases on rise for first time this year, WHO says |5.6304250690523546e+17|http://reut.rs/1AsXnuT

It added the treatment was given to 80 patients, adults and children.  |Wed Feb 04 17:20:50 +0000 2015||France says results of trials in Guinea of anti-Ebola drug encouraging |5.630243931029504e+17|http://reut.rs/1AsJZXN
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – - Sports medicine experts say physical activity guidelines for kids should address the best types of exercise, not just the duration.  . Most guidelines - including those of the World Health Organization and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - recommend that kids and teens get 60 minutes each day of moderate to vigorous exercise. Many don’t specify what kind, but imply that aerobics should be the focus, with additional “strength training” three times per week. . The current emphasis on exercise quantity limits considerations of quality, the authors write in a review article in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. . “These data were developed in the 1950s primarily for adults,” said lead author Dr. Gregory D. Myer of the Division of Sports Medicine at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.  . An hour of aerobic exercise may promote aerobic fitness and muscle strength, but not necessarily motor skill development, socialization or having fun, the authors write. . “Kids don’t ask to go run two miles, they don’t enjoy it,” Myer told Reuters Health. . The preadolescent period is the time when developing brains can best learn and reinforce motor skill control, which will make physical fitness more sustainable later in life, the authors write. . “It can be done in adults as well, motor skills and strengthening, but it’s going to be harder,” Myer said. . He and his coauthors describe developmental exercise programming called Integrative Neuromuscular Training (INT), which they say challenges and stimulates the child’s mind and body and may make them more likely to play sports or stay fit through adolescence.  . The program, which the authors developed in 2011 to reduce sports-related injuries, focuses on short bursts of purposeful activity interspersed with periods of rest. . INT includes resistance training, dynamic stability, core focused strength development, plyometrics and agility exercises adapted to specific age groups and developmental levels. The best time to start is before age 10-12 for girls and 12-14 for boys, according to the researchers. . One INT program, for example, is meant to be performed for 15 minutes twice a week at the start of gym class for second graders. It incorporates body weight exercises with punch balloons and focuses on enhancing muscular strength, muscular power and fundamental movement. . School gym classes or diverse youth sports programs would be the best setting for these regular structured activities, the authors write. . Physical education teachers already have the skills to promote motor skills activities in school, but their jobs are too often cut, Myer said. . “I do agree with the authors that the lopsided focus on quantity (60 minutes a day) is not enough to enhance children’s activity level and physical fitness,” said Dr. Urs Eiholzer, head of the PEZZ Center for Pediatric Endocrinology Zurich in Switzerland. . He was unfamiliar with the INT program the authors described, but the approach seems to be right, Eiholzer told Reuters Health by email. . “The field is so focused on how much physical activity that the quality of this physical activity is rarely looked at,” said Dr. Lisa Barnett of the School of Health and Social Development at Deakin University Australia in Melbourne. . “What this means is that teachers can interpret the activity guidelines and know they need to get the children active, and this might translate to them getting children to run around the oval a few times,” Barnett told Reuters Health by email. . More and more research is linking cognitive, motor skill and physical outcomes for kids, she said. . “Regular physical activity is crucial for children,” Eiholzer said. “It benefits perception, language, emotional skills, social behavior, in short intellectual development. Children with good motor skills can move around with greater precision, reducing the risk of accidents and developing sporting potential.” . “We used to do very gymnastic movements, somersaults, pushups,” but now some high schools don’t even require physical education classes, Myer said. Some schools are so afraid of an injury claim, one has even banned running at recess, he said. . Inadequate physical activity during preteen and teen years negatively impacts learning and brain development, he added. . “If you get them active for a little while they are going to be better learners,” Myer said. .

Emma Farge|DAKAR/MONROVIA (Reuters) - Romeo Doe, a 29-year-old tailor who survived Ebola in Liberia, is struggling to cope with the impact of a disease that killed seven members of his family and now threatens his livelihood. . Since he was released from an Ebola center in the capital Monrovia in November, pressure is rising in his eyes and affecting his vision - a complaint some doctors say is common among survivors of the West African outbreak. . There are a growing number of survivors of the disease in the region, between 5,000 and 10,000 according to the United Nations, and some complain of side effects months after their recovery - a condition some doctors are calling “post-Ebola Syndrome” (PES).   . “Since I was discharged I have felt this pain in my eyes,” said Doe. “They, as you can see, are red; they are hurting me. I want the government to help me get back on my feet.”   . Ebola, which has killed almost 9,000 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, initially causes fever and vomiting, then attacks the immune system and vital organs, often causing internal and external bleeding.  . About 60 percent of Ebola patients have died in the current outbreak, typically from shock or organ failure. . Some of those who have survived the disease report a mixture of symptoms after their recovery, including vision problems, joint pain, hair and memory loss and anxiety attacks.  . Margaret Nanyonga, a doctor who treated Ebola patients in the town of Kenema in Sierra Leone, said she had seen survivors go blind. Overall about half of those she saw recover reported declining health, she said.  . Doctors say it is not yet clear how long the symptoms last. There is also no scientific literature or medical consensus on any new syndrome among West African survivors or how many people might be affected. . Dan Kelly, founder of the non-profit organization Wellbody Alliance and a doctor specializing in infectious diseases, says the situation can be complicated by poor medical records making it hard to separate any new symptoms from pre-existing conditions. Ebola, like many severe infections, may also weaken survivors and make other illnesses more likely. . Kelly said some Ebola after-effects appear linked to the infection itself, with some patients developing symptoms similar to so-called autoimmune disorders - where the immune system is over stimulated and begins to attack the body’s own tissues. Other patients develop symptoms similar to uveitis, he said, an eye inflammation causing blindness.  . “With post-Ebola syndrome there is an autoimmune response: it’s revved up, and we don’t really know why,” he told Reuters by telephone from Sierra Leone where he is helping with the Ebola response.  . When Korlia Bonarwolo left an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia last year, his blood was free of the virus but he had caught two other life-threatening diseases: malaria and pneumonia. . The 26-year old doctor’s assistant blames his health problems on poor care, rather than complications related to Ebola infection.  . At the John F. Kennedy medical center in Monrovia, draughts from the open-air corridors left him exposed, he says, while frightened nurses threw him juice boxes which he was often too weak to retrieve. . Back home, medical colleagues shunned him and he had to insert his own intravenous drip. Six months afterwards he has fully recovered but, as president of a survivors’ association, wants to ensure others get better support and health information. . “The questions survivors are asking about where they are going to be health-wise in the future deserve answers,” Bonarwolo said at a survivors’ meeting organized by the United Nations. . The outbreak is now ebbing, and the health ministry says there are fewer than 10 cases in the country, but even survivors with no worrying symptoms say it is hard to get back to normal life with so many unanswered questions about Ebola’s impact. . One of the ongoing concerns relates to sexual health. Some female Ebola survivors say they have stopped menstruating. The virus can also remain in semen for months. . The links between Ebola and mental health disorders is also little understood. A friend of Bonarwolo’s survived Ebola only to develop a mental illness afterwards. . Ben Neumann, a virologist at Britain’s Reading University who studies Ebola and other viruses and their effects, notes that Lassa virus, which comes from West Africa and causes a similar disease to Ebola, has also been reported as having longer-term health effects. . “(Lassa) survivors often report signs of nerve damage such as loss of hearing,” he told Reuters, adding that it would be “surprising that something as damaging as Ebola did not have lasting effects”. . The current lack of knowledge about post-Ebola health effects is probably “due to Ebola being a rare virus that left few survivors before this outbreak”, he said. . Some after-effects of Ebola have been reported in previous outbreaks since the disease was first detected in 1976, but past epidemics were smaller and often more deadly, meaning there were fewer survivors to generate interest to warrant research. . So this outbreak creates a unique opportunity to learn more.  . Kelly agrees, and wants swift follow-up.  . “We are at risk of missing the window,” he said. “We need to start catching survivors as they leave treatment centers.” |Wed Feb 04 16:49:30 +0000 2015||Free from Ebola, survivors complain of new syndrome |5.630165093088215e+17|http://reut.rs/1AsE30X
Sam Wilkin|LONDON (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a possible 2016 presidential contender, canceled three scheduled media appearances in the UK on Tuesday, amid a controversy over his comments on measles vaccinations. . The Republican governor said on Monday parents needed some choice on whether to vaccinate their children, drawing criticism from political opponents who said such a policy could threaten public health. . His comments came a few hours after President Barack Obama said parents should have their children vaccinated, saying the science was “pretty indisputable.” . Christie canceled two question-and-answer sessions and a press statement he was due to make after meeting UK finance minister George Osborne. . “We just decided we’re not going to have availability today,” said Maria Comella, Christie’s head of communications, after the last scheduled appearance was canceled. . The 52-year-old governor, known for his occasionally combative relations with the media, formed a political action committee in January, a prelude to a possible bid for the presidency in 2016. . The governor visited a drug treatment center in south London, where he called for fellow Republicans to adopt a more compassionate approach to drug addiction, saying addicts needed treatment rather than jail. . Christie met recovering addicts at the center run by Action on Addiction, and said addiction should be treated like a disease rather than a personal failure. He said taking a hard line on drug addicts was the “easy” policy to take. . “All too often in both of our societies we have people who go for the lay-up, the easy stories,” said Christie. “None of the people walking in here are easy stories.” . The governor and his wife, who was with him for the visit, have made a priority of tackling drug abuse in New Jersey, where heroin use has skyrocketed in recent years. . He said those in his party who were opposed to abortion, on the principle that life is sacred, should be more sympathetic to those who had made mistakes. . “When I talk to folks in my party, being pro-life, I say it’s easy to be pro-life when they’re in the womb, they haven’t done anything wrong yet, you know, they haven’t made any bad judgments,” he said. . “Tell me that you’re pro-life with a kid who’s lying on the floor of a jail cell basement, addicted to drugs.” . The governor signed a bill in 2013 making medical marijuana available in some circumstances, but has been a staunch opponent of legalizing the drug. |Wed Feb 04 16:11:03 +0000 2015||New Jersey Governor Christie ducks media after vaccination comments |5.630068335654011e+17|http://reut.rs/1F63GmZ

Misha Hussain|CONAKRY (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) made the “big mistake” of focusing too much on treatment early on in the Ebola epidemic rather than speaking to people about tackling the disease, a senior member of the medical charity said. . MSF’s response to the worst ever outbreak of Ebola, which has killed more than 8,800 people mainly in West Africa, has been praised by the World Health Organization and governments. . With 20 years of experience of treating Ebola, MSF deployed hundreds to the Ebola “hot zones” and was quick to isolate patients and trace their contacts. . However, Claudia Evers, MSF’s Ebola emergency coordinator in Guinea, said: “MSF made a big mistake. We advocated for an increase in beds for too long, and everyone listened to MSF.” . “Instead of asking for more beds we should have asked for more sensitization activities,” Evers told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. . The latest outbreak of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever that kills roughly two-thirds of the people it infects, began in the forests of southern Guinea and was first identified in March 2014. . Mistrust of the government and health workers, partly due to lack of communication with ordinary Guineans, has prompted communities to hide infected people and bury bodies secretly, sparking fears the outbreak may flare up again, as it did twice in 2014. . A total of 42 new cases were recorded last week as well as three burials, according to government figures. In Guinea, there were just over 150 confirmed cases of Ebola in January compared with around 500 confirmed cases in December. . Sakoba Keita, head of the national Ebola response, said Ebola transmission was still active in 14 of the country’s 34 prefectures in the last week. . He said there were 11 new confirmed cases in Lola prefecture on the border with Ivory Coast and two new cases in northern Tougue, which had never before reported a case. . “Before we can get to ‘zero Ebola’, we have to get to zero resistance,” Keita told donors and aid workers at a coordination meeting on Monday, referring to the government’s 60-day Ebola eradication plan, which started at the beginning of the year. . MSF’s Evers said the next stage of the Ebola response required a new approach if the disease was to be brought under control, centered on the promotion of good hygiene practices.   . “Isolate your sick and bring them in for treatment,” she said. “In the first nine months, if people had been given (these) proper messages, all this could have been prevented.” |Wed Feb 04 15:35:02 +0000 2015||MSF says lack of public health messages on Ebola 'big mistake' |5.6299776920887706e+17|http://reut.rs/1AspWZn
Teis Jensen|COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Positive results from a trial by Danish biotech company Genmab of its bone marrow cancer drug could lead to a launch as early as this year and it may become a blockbuster treatment earning $3.5 billion in annual revenues, analysts said. . Genmab said the study of daratumumab, which evaluated multiple myeloma patients who had already had at least three different lines of therapy unsuccessfully, showed an overall response rate of 29.2 percent. . The response rate indicated Genmab’s drug worked better than two recently approved drugs, Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ Kyprolis and Celgene’s Pomalyst, although these have been tested in different ways, Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen said. . Shares in Genmab rose by as much as 10 percent early on Wednesday to a record high of 467.80 Danish crowns per share before trimming gains to 461 crowns at 1129 GMT. . Hansen said the data increased the probability of an approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that it could be launched this year. He raised his recommendation on the share to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’. . “We believe the data is very positive and well above the FDA threshold for approval. We therefore expect the study results to lead to U.S. approval of daratumumab in the second half of 2015,” Danske Bank analysts said in a note. It raised its target price to 530 crowns and maintained a ‘buy’ recommendation. .  A spokeswoman from Genmab said the company would not disclose its expectations for the timing of an approval or for the potential peak sales of daratumumab.    . Nordea raised its target price on Genmab to 670 crowns from 450 crowns and said in a note that it now sees a 90 percent probability of success for daratumumab.   . Analysts at Jefferies, which has a buy recommendation on Genmab, sees an 80 percent probability of commercial success for daratumumab and that the drug could reach annual peak sales of $3.5 billion. . Jefferies expects a potential launch of daratumumab in the first half of 2016. . Genmab’s share price has more than doubled in the last six months - including Wednesday’s gains - outperforming a 10 percent rise in the Danish benchmark index. . “It is because it has become more evident to the market that daratumumab is a very potent drug and that it is getting closer to an approval,” Hansen said. . Genmab has a market cap of almost 24 billion Danish crowns ($3.69 billion). |Wed Feb 04 12:05:38 +0000 2015||Genmab data points to early bone cancer drug launch: analysts |5.6294506997274214e+17|http://reut.rs/1ArNCgE
|ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche said on Wednesday a late-stage study involving non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients showed they lived longer without the disease worsening when treated with its Gazyva drug, giving a boost to its line-up of cancer treatments.  . Gazyva - marketed as Gazyvaro in the European Union and Switzerland - is being positioned as an alternative follow-on medicine to Roche’s Rituxan, or MabThera, which generated 6.9 billion Swiss francs ($7.46 billion) in sales last year. . Roche is hoping to switch as many patients as possible to the newer product before Rituxan faces competition from cheaper copies when its patent protection expires. . The study showed that patients with relapsed slow-growing, or indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma lived significantly longer without their disease worsening when treated with Gazyva and bendamustine followed by Gazyva alone, the company said in a statement. . The news was welcomed by investors, with Roche shares rising by 2.7 percent by 1057 GMT, outpacing the European healthcare sector index which was up 0.7 percent. . “It suggests Gazyva works in a Rituxan refractory (relapsed) population that offers sales potential in the $500 million to $1 billion range,” analysts at Deutsche Bank, which has a “buy” rating on the stock, wrote in a note. . Data from the study will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency and other health authorities for consideration for approval, the company said. . The performance of Gazyva against Rituxan in two ongoing head-to-head late-stage trials will be another important indicator, analysts said. . The trials involve patients with large B-cell lymphoma and indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. |Wed Feb 04 07:22:00 +0000 2015||Roche says study of lymphoma drug shows significant benefit |5.628736919699456e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ar7511
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - After successfully treating four Ebola patients last year, Emory University in Atlanta is now leading a government-funded project that will use blood from survivors of the deadly virus to test a novel way of treating infectious disease. . Traditional vaccines boost the immune system’s response to infections. The new project will inject people with genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, in hopes of spurring a person’s own cells to make specific antibodies capable of fighting Ebola or other pathogens. . “The person’s body is the factory,” said Dr. James Crowe of Vanderbilt University, one of the collaborators on the project. “It’s a cool idea.” . Experts say the method, if proven to be safe and effective,  would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria. . Antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases, tobacco plants, such as Mapp Biopharmaceutical’s experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp. . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s elite research arm, has awarded Emory up to $10.8 million over three years to direct the project. . It will include research teams at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and several academic research labs including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Rockefeller University, Vanderbilt and Scripps Research Institute.  . Getting access to blood samples from survivors of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been challenging, but Emory has a distinct advantage in having treated a small number of patients on U.S. soil.  . All four of its former patients agreed to take part in the program, said Rafi Ahmed, director of the Emory Vaccine Center, who is leading the effort. . Ahmed and colleagues intend to isolate antibodies made by these patients in response to the Ebola virus, and through a series of experiments in animals, identify the most effective ones for fighting off an Ebola infection. . The approach is unrelated to an experimental treatment provided to several Ebola patients in the United States, which involved transfusions of blood plasma from Ebola survivors. . Researchers will take two approaches. In one, they will produce large quantities of Ebola-fighting antibodies that could be infused into patients intravenously, a conventional approach known as passive immunization.  . Protection using this method has a short half life of about two to three weeks, and the antibodies require refrigeration, which is not always available in countries fighting an infectious disease outbreak. . That is why the team is also testing the new method for making protective drugs based on DNA or RNA, rather than the older vaccine technology using killed or weakened viruses to stimulate an immune response, a process that can take several months to manufacture.  . “In this method, we are trying to go in as silently as possible,” bypassing the immune response, which may not always work, and directly providing the recipe for a highly effective antibody, said Col. Daniel Wattendorf, program director at DARPA who came up with the new strategy. . Wattendorf said the effort is based on prior, early stage research with drugmakers Novartis and Sanofi looking at whether they could make vaccines out of ribonucleic acid, or RNA. . “What was particularly intriguing about RNA was that it has no chance of integrating into the human genome,” he said. The effect was temporary. . Initially, the technology was being developed in hopes of protecting soldiers from seasonal flu or germs that cause diarrhea on the battlefield, but the Ebola outbreak presented an opportunity to accelerate the research. . To succeed, researchers will need to identify an effective delivery system to carry the genetic instructions into the body and learn how to quickly identify the most protective antibodies. The goal is to get the process down to 90 days for most diseases, Wattendorf said. . The group is in the process of characterizing several Ebola antibody candidates to find which are the most potent, Ahmed said. At that point, the researchers and DARPA will seek out drug company partners. . Testing in people could begin within two years, with the goal of having a better weapon for the next Ebola outbreak.|Wed Feb 04 06:25:38 +0000 2015||Blood from Ebola survivors could help spur new disease treatments |5.628595057475256e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ar0CmC
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives added another notch to its lengthy record of Obamacare repeal votes on Tuesday by approving a measure that would scrap the healthcare law and direct oversight committees to come up with a replacement. . Defying a White House veto threat, lawmakers voted 239-186 on a measure to eliminate the complex web of federal subsidies, insurance reforms, taxes and regulations that have extended health coverage to millions of Americans since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. . The action now moves to the Senate, where Republican Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas conservative, introduced legislation for full repeal on Monday. . The influential conservative group Heritage Action for America called the House vote “the beginning of a multi-month effort” to send a full repeal legislation to President Barack Obama’s desk. . The White House threatened to veto the House bill, saying it would take away critical benefits from middle-class families and increase the federal deficit.  . Before the vote, Obama met with 10 people who had benefited from his signature domestic policy. He told reporters the law was working “better than intended.” . Supporters of repeal are short of the two-thirds majority needed in both chambers of Congress to override a presidential veto.  . The House has voted repeatedly to repeal, defund or dismantle Obamacare.  . But on Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats could not agree on how many times. Republican aides said the new vote brought the total to 67, including eight votes for full repeal. Democrats said there had been 56 votes to repeal or undermine the law. . The House’s second anti-Obamacare vote of 2015 was billed by Republican lawmakers as a way to give party freshmen a crack at repealing the law. Last month, lawmakers voted to scale back an Obamacare provision requiring employers to provide workers with health insurance.  . Tuesday’s bill also directed House committees to work toward Republican legislation to replace Obamacare, a goal that has eluded the party repeatedly up to now.  . Lawmakers said new legislation would be necessary in light of a U.S. Supreme Court case that could devastate Obamacare by denying federal insurance subsidies to millions of consumers in as many as 37 states served by the federal website, HealthCare.gov. A ruling is expected in June.  . Obamacare advocates said Republicans were trying to persuade the Supreme Court to vote against the law by promoting a legislative goal they could not actually achieve. |Wed Feb 04 01:15:11 +0000 2015||House votes to repeal and eventually replace Obamacare |5.6278137834205594e+17|http://reut.rs/1F3Ez4m
Eric M. Johnson|SEATTLE/DENVER (Reuters) - Vending machines selling medical marijuana opened for business in Seattle on Tuesday, in what the company providing them billed as a first-in-the-state innovation that it expects to expand to other cities and states where pot is legal as medicine. . The first purchase from a ZaZZZ, as the user-automated machines are called, was for one gram of a strain dubbed Girl Scout Cookies for $15, inside Seattle Caregivers medical marijuana dispensary. . “It’s a way to take something that has proven itself as a viable business model throughout the last century, and bring it into the 21st century,” said Stephen Shearin, president of technology company American Green Inc, which provides the machines. . Washington state voters joined Colorado in 2012 in legalizing recreational marijuana, ushering in retail shops carrying a range of pot products for adults. Voters in Alaska and Oregon adopted similar initiatives last year. . But in Washington state, a loosely regulated medical marijuana industry runs alongside the recreational pot system. . The Seattle vending machine debut comes as lawmakers in Olympia weigh numerous marijuana-related bills, including a wide-ranging proposal to align the medical and recreational industries by phasing out collective gardens and allowing medical dispensaries to transition to recreational-use shops. . Shearin said about five ZaZZZ vending machines are currently planned for Seattle and Washington state, with more slated for Colorado, California, Michigan, Rhode Island and Alaska, all among the 23 states where medical marijuana is legal. . Marijuana vending machines are also provided by other companies, such as California’s Medbox Inc, but regulators in each state did not know how many vending machines were operating. . The machines are upgraded versions of the first ZaZZZ machine that opened last April in Colorado’s Herbal Elements dispensary, which only carries edibles. . The Seattle machine was stocked with cannabis flower, vaporizer pens, hemp-oil energy drinks and other merchandise, Shearin said, adding that machines would carry unique products not available in the dispensaries where they are located. . A buyer’s medical marijuana license is checked by a dispensary employee before that person can use the machine, which uses an ID-card scanner. . At a recreational-use pot shop, such a machine would have to be installed behind the counter and operated by an employee, under Washington state law. . “What is the purpose of having a vending machine if it’s got to be manned?” said John Davis, who owns dispensaries in Seattle. “Why not just sell them the product?” |Wed Feb 04 00:59:32 +0000 2015||Medical pot vending machine debuts in Seattle |5.627774397396009e+17|http://reut.rs/1F3Ci9a
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Britain voted on Tuesday to become the first country to allow a “three-parent” IVF technique which doctors say will prevent some inherited incurable diseases but which critics see as a step towards creating designer babies. . The treatment is known as “three-parent” in vitro fertilisation (IVF) because the babies, born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor. . It is designed to help families with mitochondrial diseases, incurable conditions passed down the maternal line that affect around one in 6,500 children worldwide.  . After an emotionally charged 90-minute debate that some lawmakers criticised as being too short for such a serious matter, parliament voted 382 to 128 in favour of the technique, called mitochondrial donation.  . The vote paves the way for a medical world first for Britain — which along with the United States has been at the forefront of scientific research on the treatments — but one that is fiercely disputed by some religious groups and other critics. . The process involves intervening in the fertilisation process to remove mitochondria, which act as tiny energy-generating batteries inside cells, and which, if faulty, can cause inherited conditions such as fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. . Mitochondrial DNA is separate from DNA found in the cell nucleus and does not affect human characteristics such as hair or eye colour, appearance or personality traits.  . “I wouldn’t stand here and defend the concept of designer babies — choosing the colour of the eyes and all the rest of it. This is about purely dealing with those terrible, terrible illnesses,” opposition Labour lawmaker Andrew Miller, chair of parliament’s science and technology committee, told the debate. . International charities, advocacy groups and scientists had urged Britain to pass laws to allow the treatment, saying it brought a “first glimmer of hope” for some families of having a baby who could live without suffering. . “We have finally reached a milestone in giving women an invaluable choice, the choice to become a mother without fear of passing on a lifetime under the shadow of mitochondrial disease to their child,” Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said following the vote. . In an open letter to lawmakers, 11 international campaign groups, including the U.S. United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, described the condition as “unimaginably cruel”. . “It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more,” they wrote. . Lawmakers were given a free vote on the issue, and Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman said the British leader had voted to support it, adding it was not “about playing God”. . “He has a particular sympathy with those parents whose children are born with very serious illnesses, that in nearly all cases end their lives prematurely,” the spokesman said, referring to Cameron’s son Ivan who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy and died aged six in 2009. . Proposed new laws allowing the treatments to be carried out in Britain still have to be approved by the upper house, which commentators expect to endorse parliament’s support.  . Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility clinic and a reproductive ethicist, urged the scientists developing the techniques to continue “to educate and reassure those who continue to have anxieties”.   . The Bishops Conference of England and Wales said the Church opposed the destruction of human embryos as part of the process and hoped treatments for mitochondrial disease could be found. . “The human embryo is a new human life with potential; it should be respected and protected from the moment of conception and not used as disposable material,” Bishop John Sherrington said in a statement.      . Other critics say the technique will lead to the creation of genetically modified “designer babies”, with Conservative lawmaker Fiona Bruce saying it would amount to letting “the genie out of the bottle”. . “Where will it lead? The answer has to be that we stop here. The answer has to be that we say this is a red line in our country, as in every other country in the world, that we will not cross,” she said during the debate. |Wed Feb 04 00:16:38 +0000 2015||Britain votes to allow world's first 'three-parent' IVF babies |5.627666458660168e+17|http://reut.rs/1F3v0T7
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Almost $2.9 billion was pledged by the end of 2014 in donations to fight West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, yet only around 40 percent had actually reached affected countries, researchers said on Tuesday. . A study by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that tracked international donations showed barely $1.09 billion had reached the worst affected countries by the end of last year, they said. . “These delays ... may have contributed to spread of the virus and could have increased the financial needs,” said Karen Grepin, a global health policy expert at New York University who led the study and published it in the BMJ British medical journal. . The West Africa Ebola epidemic, the worst in history, has killed more than 8,800 people since it began more than a year ago, decimating already weak health systems in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Its spread now appears to be slowing, especially in Liberia which now has just five cases. . Grepin analysed the level and speed of pledges made to fight Ebola and how they aligned with estimates of funds required to control the epidemic.     . She found not only that more than half of funds pledged by international donors had not reached the target countries, but also that global agencies had failed to reliably estimate the amount of money needed. . While Guinea first informed the World Health Organization of a “rapidly evolving outbreak” of Ebola on March 23, 2014, the first major international appeal was not until August, when some $71 million was asked for. . By mid-September 2014, around six months after the epidemic started, the United Nations estimated $1 billion would be needed, only to raise that in November to an estimate of $1.5 billion. . “Clearly, international leaders have found it challenging to estimate the financial requirements to tackle this rapidly spreading outbreak,” Grepin said in a commentary about her findings. “The problem has not been the generosity of donors but that the resources have not been deployed rapidly enough.” . U.N. Ebola chief David Nabarro said last month a further $4 billion — equivalent to all aid committed so far — was needed by relief agencies and authorities in the worst affected countries to end the epidemic, with U.N. agencies alone needing $1 billion of that to fund their part in the fight.   |Wed Feb 04 00:00:46 +0000 2015||Only 40 percent of Ebola funds reached target countries: study |5.6276265329545626e+17|http://reut.rs/1Aq0Vhx

Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Pfizer Inc’s Ibrance, a potential new standard of care for  advanced breast cancer, in a regulatory decision that came more than two months earlier than expected. . Wall Street has considered the drug, whose chemical name is palbociclib, to be one of the most promising medicines in Pfizer’s development pipeline. It was approved for previously untreated postnopausal women whose cancer cells have receptors to the female hormone estrogen and who do not have mutations in the HER2 gene that can contribute to uncontrolled growth of breast cells. . Such patients represent the largest proportion of breast cancer cases and are typically treated with the chemotherapy tamoxifen or letrozole, a drug used to prevent production of estrogen. . Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala has estimated Ibrance could generate annual sales of $3 billion by 2020.   . It works through a new mechanism of action, by blocking two enzymes involved in cell division, CDK4 and CDK6. In one clinical trial, the average patient taking Ibrance in combination with the standard treatment letrozole went 20.2 months without a worsening of symptoms - twice the length of time of those taking letrozole alone. . “This approval represents the first treatment advance for this group of women in more than 10 years,” said Mace Rothenberg, the head of oncology for Pfizer. . UCLA which helped test the drug for Pfizer, in a statement, said Ibrance produced “groundbreaking results” in studies conducted at the university and has potential to become a mainstay treatment.  . Ibrance will give a big boost to Pfizer as it attempts to bolster its medicine cabinet with new cancer drugs, including ones that work by harnessing the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. . The largest U.S. drugmaker badly needs big-selling new drugs to boost its earnings, following patent expirations on many of its biggest brands and a relatively thin supply of promising drugs in late-stage trials.    |Tue Feb 03 21:57:02 +0000 2015||U.S. FDA approves Pfizer's high profile breast cancer drug |5.6273151258894336e+17|http://reut.rs/1F378Px

Shereen Lehman|Roughly one in three people who took an online survey would prefer to risk an earlier death rather than take a pill every day to prevent heart disease. . About one in five would be willing to pay at least $1,000 to avoid taking a pill every day for the rest of their lives. . The study “reinforces the idea that many people do not like taking pills, for whatever reason,” said Dr. Robert Hutchins of the University of California, San Francisco. . “Most physicians I know are very well aware of that, however, so it reiterates that we should be having discussions with patients about what their priorities are, and if they value the extended life they might get from taking a pill more than the effect on their quality of life for having to take that pill every day for the rest of their life,” Hutchins added, in email to Reuters Health. . Hutchins and his colleagues designed the survey to find out, hypothetically, how much time at the end of their lives people would be willing to give up just to avoid taking preventive medications every day.  . They also asked how much people would pay to avoid having to take pills, and how much of a risk of death they’d accept to avoid taking drugs to prevent cardiovascular disease. . The pills would be free, and participants were told to ignore potential side effects. . A thousand people – mostly women and of an average age of 50 – completed the online survey, the researchers reported in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.  . In “real life,” four out of five were taking daily medication, with 54 percent taking at least three pills a day. . Overall, about 70 percent said they wouldn’t trade any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a pill every day.  . But more than 8 percent were willing to trade up to two years of life to avoid taking pills every day. And roughly 21 percent would trade between one week and a year. . About 13 percent would accept a small risk of death to avoid taking a pill every day, and 9 percent would risk a 10 percent chance. About 62 percent weren’t willing to gamble any risk of immediate death.  . On average, respondents said they’d pay $1,445 to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives - but 41 percent said they wouldn’t pay any amount.   . Hutchins thinks the findings are useful to biotech researchers who are developing new ways to administer medicines.  . “What if we can deliver medication like aspirin and statins without someone having to take a pill? It would almost certainly increase compliance while also improving that person’s quality of life by removing the hassle of having to take a pill daily,” Hutchins said. . Dr. Mario Garcia, chief of the Division of Cardiology and co-director of the Montefiore-Einstein Center for Heart and Vascular Care in New York was concerned that study participants might not accurately reflect the general population.   . Still, Garcia was impressed that such a large number of people would be willing to take medication every day. . “There were almost 70 percent of people who would take a pill a day even to live one week longer, and that’s remarkable,” he said. . But on the other hand, Garcia said, people often don’t like to pay for medications.  . “Clearly people will be compliant if they don’t have any side effects,” he said, “On the other hand, they probably wouldn’t be willing to pay out-of-pocket too much. .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - A new study is the latest to link blue-light emitting devices, like laptops, phones and game consoles, to shorter sleep in adolescents. . “There are probably many possible pathways between screen time and sleep, some of which are direct,” said lead author Mari Hysing of Uni Research Health in Bergen, Norway. “The light from the screens may directly affect our circadian rhythms, and teenagers may be especially sensitive.” . As reported in the journal BMJ Open, she and her coauthors analyzed survey responses from almost 10,000 teens, ages 16 to 19, in Western Norway.  . More than 90 percent of girls and 80 percent of boys reported using a cell phone in the hour before bed, and laptops were almost as common. . Throughout the day, girls reported an average of 5.5 hours of screen time with any device - a personal computer, cell phone, MP3 player, tablet, game console or TV - and boys averaged almost seven hours per day. A large proportion of those hours were spent chatting online. Boys and girls spent an average of half an hour each day on emails. . Boys averaged almost an hour on console video games and more than an hour on PC games. . Using any device in the hour before bed was associated with a 13 to 52 percent increase in the likelihood of needing more than 60 minutes to fall asleep, the researchers found.  . More than four daytime hours of screen time was associated with a similar increase in risk of “sleep latency,” or taking a long time to fall asleep. . Screen time was also linked to an increased risk of a sleep deficit of at least two hours, meaning the kids said they needed two more hours of sleep than they were actually getting. . The teens tended to use many devices at once, so it was hard to compare them and see if certain devices were more strongly linked to sleep quality, Hysing said. . Several studies recently have showed that the more frequently young people use these media devices, the greater the chance their sleep will be disturbed, said Michael Gradisar, a clinical psychologist and sleep researcher at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia. . “This study by Hysing and colleagues was eye-opening because they showed that screen use above the recommended two hours per day was associated with sleep durations well below the norm, and in the range we see linked with poor school performance, emotional disturbances, and in some cases suicidal ideation,” Gradisar, who was not part of the new study, told Reuters Health by email. . “There is now much evidence, including this study, to suggest that screen time has a direct effect on sleep,” Hysing told Reuters Health by email. . But, Hysing said, it could also be that “some families who do not have fixed bedtimes for their teenagers are the same who do not limit screen time.”  . Also, she said. “We know that depressed teenagers often sleep less, and this might also be related to screen time use.” . This study only included data from one point in time, so there is no way to prove that using screens caused a change in sleep patterns, said Emma Adam, a developmental psychologist at Northwestern University in Chicago. . “We can’t rule out the possibility that they use screens more because they can’t sleep, but certainly there is other evidence that screen time right before bed affects sleep,” Adam told Reuters Health by phone.  . The National Sleep Foundation recommends that teens avoid eating, drinking, or exercising within a few hours of their bedtime and try to avoid the TV, computer and telephone in the hour before going to bed. . “While there has been a focus on media use in younger children, we know that many teenagers do not have parental-set bedtimes nor restrictions on media use,” Hysing said. “The most important thing we can do is to keep the night screen free.” .

P.J. Huffstutter|(Reuters) - The state of Washington said Tuesday it has established a third poultry quarantine zone after state officials discovered that a flock of about 100 birds in Okanogan County was infected with the avian influenza virus. . The Washington State Department of Agriculture adopted an emergency rule on Sunday to establish the new quarantine area, which encompasses a six-mile area in Oroville, Wash., state officials said. . State officials are conducting additional tests to identify the specific flue strain that infected the flock. About half of the 100 birds have died, according to agriculture officials. . The quarantine generally restricts the movement of all eggs, poultry or poultry products from leaving that area.  . The state had set up the first emergency quarantine in the area on Jan. 29, after a flock of nearly 5,000 birds tested positive for the H5N2 influenza strain. Another quarantine zone was also set up in Clallam County, in response to a separate infected flock. . The U.S. Department of Agriculture said at the time the virus did not pose a health risk to the public, and birds and other poultry products from such infected flocks would not enter the food system. . Regardless, China last month banned all imports of U.S. poultry products and eggs following the discovery of avian influenza in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the USDA said. All poultry shipped to China after Jan. 8 was to be returned or destroyed, the agency said. [ID:nL1N0UR2FQ] . The virus is extremely contagious among poultry and can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 48 hours. The H5N2 strain has also been found in backyard chicken flocks in Idaho.   . A different strain, H5N8, forced a temporary quarantine of a Foster Farms turkey ranch in California last month, with the birds destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease to migratory and commercial flocks.   |Tue Feb 03 20:07:02 +0000 2015||Washington State sets up third poultry quarantine amid avian flu worries |5.6270383067326464e+17|http://reut.rs/1F2LvPc
Shereen Lehman|Evacuating children during wartime doesn’t necessarily increase their risk of psychiatric problems later on, according to a new study. . That was true overall for the subjects of the study, adults who as children were evacuated from Finland to Sweden in World War II. . But while men who were evacuated as boys were less likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital as adults, compared to their siblings who stayed home, girls who were evacuated were more likely to have mood disorders later on. . During World War II, about 45,000 Finnish children were evacuated to Swedish foster families to protect them from the war. A few previous studies suggest these children were more likely to have mental health problems later in life . But Torsten Santavirta, who led the new study, said those other efforts may have been biased. So he and his coauthors decided to re-examine the issue by comparing people who were evacuated as kids to their siblings who remained behind. . “The evacuation policy has been subject to active debate in both Finland and Sweden, with loud criticism by former evacuees,” said Santavirta, a researcher with the Swedish Institute for Social Research at Stockholm University.   . “The conventional wisdom seems to be that the evacuation as a rule left substantial scars in the form of childhood trauma,” he told Reuters Health in an email . Santavirta said he and his colleagues wondered why no one seemed to think the opposite might be true – that remaining with their biological family and being exposed to war may have been just as stressful for the children. . For their study, published in The BMJ, the team used Finnish census information to find people who had been born between 1933 and 1944, along with data from a Finnish child evacuee registry.   . They also used hospital discharge records to identify 4,441 people who’d been admitted to hospitals for mental disorders between 1971 and 2011, including 2,456 men. About 3 percent of these people had been evacuated to Swedish foster families for an average stay of two years. . Overall, the researchers saw no link between being evacuated and any greater likelihood of being hospitalized for mental disorders later. In fact, it appeared that men who were evacuated were less likely to be hospitalized compared to their siblings who stayed in Finland during the war.  . The study team did find that girls who were evacuated were more likely to be admitted to hospitals for mood disorders as adults.  . The authors acknowledge some limitations to their study. Follow-up began when the participants were 38 years old, so it’s possible that earlier psychiatric diagnoses were missed. In addition, the authors didn’t look at whether the kids who were evacuated had any special characteristics –  for instance, it’s possible those kids tended to be more emotionally resilient.  . Nonetheless, Santavirta says, this is so far the most definitive study on the long-term psychiatric consequences of the Finnish Evacuation Policy, and “we think the results have predictive value for contemporary child refugee policy.” . Children currently represent about 5 percent of refugee populations across the world, due to war, natural disasters and abuse. There were more than 21,000 asylum claims made for refugee children in 2012, alone, Santavirta’s team writes. . “Our study suggests that evacuations policies designed in the same manner as the Finnish one may not be more detrimental than being directly exposed to the war itself,” Santavirta said. . He added that gender-specific strategies might need to be considered when confronting situations in which children are exposed to war-related conflict and family separation. . SOURCE: .

Lisa Rapaport|Celiac disease may be at the root of some women’s problems with infertility, Indian researchers say. While there are many more common causes of infertility, the study suggests that women who don’t have a ready explanation for their failure to conceive should be screened for celiac disease, said Dr. Govind Makharia, a professor at All India institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. “There isn’t strong evidence to say that celiac disease causes infertility, but there are many anecdotal experiences where women with infertility have conceived after being diagnosed with celiac disease and put on a gluten free diet,” Makharia told Reuters Health in an e-mail  . About one in 100 people have celiac disease. If they consume wheat, barley or rye, or foods that contain those grains, their immune response leads to intestinal damage, malnutrition and other problems.  . Generally, women are considered infertile after one year of unsuccessfully trying to conceive, or six months if they are older than 35. The most common causes are hormonal problems that stop the ovaries from producing or releasing mature eggs. Being extremely underweight or overweight can impact fertility, as can excessive exercise, smoking, and drinking.  . To explore the link between celiac disease and infertility, Makharia’s research team pooled results from previously published research studies. . Women with infertility were 3.5 times more likely to have celiac disease than women who didn’t have difficulty conceiving, the analysis found, based on a review of three studies including 449 women with infertility.  . For women with no known cause for their infertility, the connection was even stronger. These women were six times more likely to have celiac disease, based on data from five studies including 422 women with unexplained infertility.  . “Celiac disease has been claimed to be the most common cause of unexplained infertility and these results support that conclusion,” said Dr. Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  . Celiac disease is not always recognized right away in women with fertility issues because ob-gyns will typically send them to see an endocrinologist, to explore hormonal causes, before they consider rarer conditions such as celiac disease, said Fasano, who wasn’t involved in the study. . The study findings suggest that ob-gyns should consider a blood test to rule out celiac disease before sending a woman to other specialists, he said. . “If I was an ob-gyn, I would do the screening for celiac right there in my office before I sent the woman anywhere else,” Fasano said. . Typically though, doctors start looking for the cause of infertility by asking women to record what’s known as their basal body temperature, a reading taken immediately after waking up each morning, for two to three months to see which days the temperature spikes to indicate ovulation. This will show whether the woman has a normal menstrual cycle, and whether she’s ovulating at the same time each month, potentially helping her to plan intercourse during the point in the cycle when she’s most likely to conceive. . There may also be urine and blood tests to screen for a variety of hormones involved in ovulation, as well as imaging tests to see if there are problems with the Fallopian tubes or the uterus.  . While the new analysis, published in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, establishes a link between celiac disease and infertility, it doesn’t prove that celiac disease causes infertility, a task that has eluded scientists for decades. The researchers also said that the validity of their analysis is limited because it’s based on just a handful of published studies with a small number of women.  . “The issue of celiac disease as a cause of infertility has remained a debatable issue,” Makharia said. “The pooling of data from all the eligible studies in this meta-analysis now brings forth reasonable evidence to support screening.” .

Olivia Oran|NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - For two decades, Allergan Inc  president Doug Ingram labored to transform the Botox-maker from a sleepy eye care upstart to a global aesthetics giant. He was just a few months away from getting the top job when a merger deal with Actavis Plc in November thwarted his ambitions. . Ingram has now accepted an advisory role to facilitate the merger and will soon be looking for a job outside the combined company. Allergan’s derailed succession plans, disclosed by Ingram and other top executives in interviews with Reuters, underscore how corporate mergers can leave even some of the industry’s top executives in the cold. . To be sure, Ingram has many options. While he is currently focused on helping Allergan and Actavis with their integration, he has already received interest from other healthcare companies as well as private equity firms, he said in an interview, declining to name them. . “(The merger) is bittersweet for me personally. We had a really exciting vision for this company and people were very much behind me,” Ingram said. . Ingram will get more than $26 million in cash, stock and benefits as a payout for the merger, a regulatory filing shows. His total compensation in 2013 was $3.6 million. . Ingram focused on running Allergan’s core business over the last year while 61-year-old CEO David Pyott, who was preparing for his retirement, served as Allergan’s public face and met with investors to defend the company from a hostile bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. . Ingram also spearheaded $475 million in cost cuts for calendar 2015. He also helped create the company’s European operations and led a landmark free speech lawsuit that challenged U.S. policy on drug promotion. . “He has to be on everybody’s dance card if you are looking for a CEO of a substantial, complicated, global company,” Pyott said about Ingram. “Here is a person that was very ready to take over.” . A serial marathon runner known for sending out e-mails at 3 a.m., Ingram is a sociable executive who keeps a guitar in his office and likes to jam with his colleagues, often to the tune of Led Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway to Heaven’. . Ingram’s status as a key Allergan insider, pivotal to the success of the $66 billion deal with Actavis, was reaffirmed just last week, in a one-on-one dinner with Actavis CEO Brent Saunders. . Saunders had flown to California for a three-day round of meetings with Allergan. Included in his agenda was meeting Ingram, who picked up Saunders from his hotel in his white Tesla and drove to steak and seafood restaurant Mastro’s in Orange County to discuss integration strategy. . Ingram joined Allergan in 1996 as its chief litigation counsel after spending six years as a corporate lawyer. . He quickly rose the ranks, yet despite his internal success, Ingram is little known to the investor community. . “Doug has been a vital part of the company’s strategy and success,” said Matthew Maletta, Allergan’s associate general counsel who has worked with Ingram since 2001. “I have been a stockholder in Allergan forever and I would buy more if Doug was getting the CEO job.”    (Reporting by Olivia Oran and Nadia Damouni in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)|Tue Feb 03 19:21:41 +0000 2015||How the #Actavis deal upended #Allergan No. 2's CEO ambitions: |5.626924202705879e+17|http://reut.rs/1yCwmQb
|(Reuters) - HCA Holdings Inc, the largest operator of U.S. for-profit hospitals, said on Tuesday demand for healthcare services had increased as the economy strengthened and more patients obtained insurance, but it was leveling off. . Patient volumes at the company’s hospitals grew in the second half of 2014 as people who gained access to health insurance under President Barack Obama’s reform law sought medical services.  . A busier-than-normal flu season and a tendency for people to schedule procedures after meeting insurance deductibles earlier in the year also boosted demand in the fourth quarter, executives said on the company’s earnings conference call. . Still, growth in the number of newly insured patients seeking services is expected to taper in 2015, they said. . The use of healthcare services has been under a microscope for the past six months as hospitals and insurers began reporting increased volumes and investors tried to determine whether insurers would need to pay more claims for each patient. . “We do think the market is going to revert back to normalized demand growth, and some of that is the macro-economic picture but some of it is normalized activity with respect to the flu and so forth,” HCA Chief Operating Officer Sam Hazen said. . HCA reported a 14 percent rise in adjusted earnings, but its 2015 outlook was weaker than analysts had expected, sending its shares down more than 1 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  |Tue Feb 03 19:15:14 +0000 2015||HCA sees demand for hospital services leveling off |5.6269079649192346e+17|http://reut.rs/1Ap32lM
|(Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran Corp said on Tuesday that it will back Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni and Sovaldi as exclusive hepatitis C treatments on its drug coverage lists. . Gilead has been striking deals with pharmacy benefit managers and insurers since AbbVie Inc late last year launched a competing product called Viekera Pak that produces similar high cure rates for hepatitis C. . The agreement puts Catamaran among the majority of payers which have announced deals for preferred or exclusive status fpr the Gilead drug, including Aetna Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc. . Catamaran said its agreement is based on clinical outcomes and delivered through its BriovaRx specialty pharmacy. It said patients would be monitored for full adherence to the drug regimen. . The company declined to provide further information about the structure of the agreement, which it said is designed to ensure that the high-cost therapies deliver their promised results. . Harvoni, a combination pill that includes Sovaldi, has a list price of $94,500 while Sovaldi alone sells for $84,000 per treatment. AbbVie’s treatment, which comes in a blister pack with multiple pills to be taken each day, lists for $83,319. Analysts and investors have estimated that the price war between AbbVie and Gilead has resulted in discounts and rebates of around 30 percent, but both companies have declined to comment on these figures. |Tue Feb 03 19:15:14 +0000 2015||Catamaran backs Gilead's hepatitis C treatment over AbbVie competitor |5.626907944324956e+17|http://reut.rs/1F2Egqu
Emily Stephenson|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional leaders and several possible 2016 presidential hopefuls said on Tuesday all children should be vaccinated, joining a debate that has become a national flashpoint as a measles outbreak rekindles a discussion on parents’ right to forgo inoculation of their children.  . “There is absolutely no medical science or data whatsoever that links those vaccinations to onset of autism or anything of that nature,” U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said. . “So absolutely, all children in American should be vaccinated,” Rubio, a potential Republican presidential candidate, told reporters on Tuesday. . House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, told reporters that he did not know if additional laws were needed but that children should be vaccinated.  . President Barack Obama this week urged parents to have their children vaccinated against preventable diseases such as the measles. But Republicans are more divided as to whether parents should have more leeway. . Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, but an outbreak that began in California in December has shone a spotlight on the so-called anti-vaccination movement.  . Debunked theories that once suggested a link between vaccines and autism have led some parents to refuse to have their children inoculated. Even though doctors say those fears are unfounded, many parents want to decide for themselves whether to vaccinate their children. . Republicans who are thought to be weighing 2016 runs leaped into the debate this week. . Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, an ophthalmologist, said in an interview with CNBC on Monday that he had heard of instances where vaccines caused “mental disorders.” . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican and potential 2016 presidential candidate, said parents needed a “measure of choice.” His spokesman later said the governor believed kids should be vaccinated against measles. . But other possible contenders on Tuesday urged parents to make sure their children get the necessary vaccines. . “I have no reservations about whether or not it is a good idea and desirable for all children to be vaccinated,” Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said in a statement. “There is a lot of fear mongering out there on this.” . Indiana Governor Mike Pence said his administration urges families to get their children vaccinated. .

Sam Wilkin|LONDON (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a possible 2016 presidential contender, cancelled three scheduled media appearances in the UK on Tuesday, amid a controversy over his comments on measles vaccinations. . The Republican governor said on Monday parents needed some choice on whether to vaccinate their children, drawing criticism from political opponents who said such a policy could threaten public health. . His comments came a few hours after President Barack Obama said parents should have their children vaccinated, saying the science was “pretty indisputable.” . Christie cancelled two question-and-answer sessions and a press statement he was due to make after meeting UK finance minister George Osborne. . “We just decided we’re not going to have availability today,” said Maria Comella, Christie’s head of communications, after the last scheduled appearance was cancelled. . The 52-year-old governor, known for his occasionally combative relations with the media, formed a political action committee in January, a prelude to a possible bid for the presidency in 2016. . The governor visited a drug treatment centre in south London, where he called for fellow Republicans to adopt a more compassionate approach to drug addiction, saying addicts needed treatment rather than jail. . Christie met recovering addicts at the centre run by Action on Addiction, and said addiction should be treated like a disease rather than a personal failure. He said taking a hard line on drug addicts was the “easy” policy to take. . “All too often in both of our societies we have people who go for the lay-up, the easy stories,” said Christie. “None of the people walking in here are easy stories.” . The governor and his wife, who was with him for the visit, have made a priority of tackling drug abuse in New Jersey, where heroin use has skyrocketed in recent years. . He said those in his party who were opposed to abortion, on the principle that life is sacred, should be more sympathetic to those who had made mistakes. . “When I talk to folks in my party, being pro-life, I say it’s easy to be pro-life when they’re in the womb, they haven’t done anything wrong yet, you know, they haven’t made any bad judgements,” he said. . “Tell me that you’re pro-life with a kid who’s lying on the floor of a jail cell basement, addicted to drugs.” . The governor signed a bill in 2013 making medical marijuana available in some circumstances, but has been a staunch opponent of legalizing the drug. |Tue Feb 03 16:01:42 +0000 2015||Chris Christie calls for compassionate approach to drug addicts |5.6264209014092186e+17|http://reut.rs/1F2cjz9
Laurie Goering|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In Pakistan, where just a third of married women use contraception, half of all pregnancies - 4.2 million each year - are unintended, according to the Washington-based Population Reference Bureau. . At the same time, the rising population in Pakistan – and elsewhere around the world - is creating more climate-changing emissions and putting more people in the path of extreme weather, food and water shortages, and other climate change pressures. . That suggests that giving more women who want it access to birth control to limit their family size – in both rich and poor countries – could be a hugely effective way to curb climate change and to build greater resilience to its impacts, according to population and climate change researchers and policy experts. . “We’re not talking about population control. We’re talking about giving people the choice to limit their family size and all the good things that go on from that” such as better health and education, said Baroness Jennny Tonge, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health, during an event at the UK Parliament Monday on linking population and climate issues. . Bringing together two politically contentious concerns – climate change and managing population growth – in an effort to build effective policy has been far from easy.  . “They’re both sensitive and it’s difficult to make headway on either, much less both together,” admitted Jason Bremner, a demographer and associate vice president of the Population Reference Bureau. . Still, an international coalition of experts on climate change, family planning and development aid are now pushing for universal access to family planning to be recognized as a part of “climate-compatible development” and included in new U.N.-backed Sustainable Development Goals set to be agreed in  September. . Some countries, such as Ethiopia, already have included family planning among the activities they want to undertake on climate change, using international climate finance, according to an analysis by the London-based Population and Sustainability Network. . “They themselves identified population as a factor making it more difficult for them to adapt. We in the north are worried about, ‘Is it fair to make this connection?’ when people in the south are already making it,” said Karen Newman, coordinator of the network. . Population growth has an impact on climate-related pressures as diverse as land availability, access to water, deforestation and migration, which often occurs “to coastal areas where vulnerability to climate change is very high”, said Newman, a sexual and reproductive health and rights expert. . Family planning could potentially find a funding source in the Green Climate Fund, which was established as part of U.N.-led climate talks and which will later this year and early next begin its first distributions of about $10 billion in funds donated to help poor countries adapt to climate change impacts or adopt a lower-emission development path. . Money is key because “we can make all the policies in the world but if there isn’t financing for both (climate change and birth control), neither are going to get any better”, Bremner said. . But he admitted he had “not a lot” of confidence family planning projects would be supported by the climate fund, which faces a huge range of demands on its resources. |Tue Feb 03 15:00:40 +0000 2015||Birth control access key means of reaching climate goals: experts |5.6262672964755866e+17|http://reut.rs/1F22MIf
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A daycare center at a Southern California high school has been closed and more than a dozen infants placed under three-week quarantine after a baby enrolled in the program was diagnosed with measles, a school district official said on Monday. . The move comes as public health officials reported that more than 100 people across the United States were infected with measles, many of them traced to an outbreak that began at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim in December. . The child, who is under a year old and therefore unvaccinated, was enrolled in the daycare center at Santa Monica High School, said Gail Pinsker, spokeswoman for the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. . A freshman baseball coach at Santa Monica High School was diagnosed with measles last month, but Pinsker said the two cases were not connected and that the coach had recovered from his illness. . “There is concern in the community over this. This is a concerning disease,” she said. “Over the last couple weeks we’ve encouraged families to get students immunized.” . Pinsker said that the “infant room” at the daycare center had been closed indefinitely following the diagnosis and that 14 other babies enrolled there had been placed under 21-day quarantine on the orders of Los Angeles County health officials. . The daycare center’s “toddler room” had been closed through Thursday, she said, and all children would be required to show proof of immunization before they would be allowed to return. . “The district is trying to stay on top this and being as transparent as possible,” Pinsker said. “The health and safety of our students and staff is our first priority.”  . The California Department of Public Health said on Monday that 92 cases of measles had been confirmed in the state, up from 91 on Friday. More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 13 other U.S. states and in Mexico. No deaths have been reported. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the nation had its highest number of measles cases in two decades. . Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. |Tue Feb 03 14:47:25 +0000 2015||RT @ReutersUS: California daycare center closed after baby diagnosed with measles: |5.626233988962386e+17|http://reut.rs/1uTYe0v

Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental diabetes drug took a longer-than-expected 36 weeks to show a statistically significant reduction in blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. . The mid-stage study had aimed to prove that a 200 mg dose of the drug taken over 26 weeks would work better than a placebo on 92 patients suffering from uncontrolled blood sugar, despite treatment. . Isis did not disclose the effect of the drug, ISIS-PTP1B, at 26 weeks. The company’s stock fell nearly 10 percent on Tuesday. . Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young said the data looked less robust than some commonly prescribed treatments and Isis’s own experimental glucagon receptor, ISIS-GCGR. . Isis noticed that blood sugar levels kept falling even after dosing was stopped after 26 weeks, and expects the drug to lower sugar levels further over a longer duration, analysts said. . The company could conduct an additional trial and/or narrow the target population, Laidlaw & Co analyst Yale Jen told Reuters. . The trial’s other main goal assesses the “incidence, severity, dose-relationship of adverse effects, and changes in laboratory evaluations as a measure of safety” at the end of 38 weeks. . Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition which occurs when the body does not use insulin properly. It afflicts up to 95 percent of the roughly 29 million diabetics in the United States. . Isis’s drug inhibits the protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B, or PTP-1B, which acts as a negative regulator of insulin. . The treatment is aimed at allowing patients to effectively use insulin and treating those beginning to fail oral therapies, extending the time they have before becoming reliant on insulin. . Patients treated with ISIS-PTP1B had a 0.7 percentage points mean reduction in glycated hemoglobin, compared with a average fall of 0.2 percentage points in placebo-treated patients, Isis said. . Glycated hemoglobin, also known as HbA1c, is used to measure how well diabetes is being controlled. . The company expects ISIS-PTP1B will be used in conjunction with most other commonly used diabetes drugs, including insulin, GLP-1 agonists and more traditional medicines such as metformin. . Isis stock was down 8.5 percent at $62.83 in late morning trading, and Laidlaw’s Jen said investors were overreacting. . “Some Isis investors are quite spoiled,” he said. “They looking at the stock like the Super Bowl, they need a 45 to 2 outcome instead of a 28 or 24 which is probably more realistic.” |Tue Feb 03 12:52:26 +0000 2015||Isis Pharma's diabetes drug successful in mid-stage study |5.625944611220439e+17|http://reut.rs/1F1M3Vt
|LONDON (Reuters) - A unit of the African Union said on Tuesday it was developing outbreak and epidemic insurance for African sovereigns following the Ebola outbreak. . The African Risk Capacity (ARC), the continent’s sovereign disaster risk insurer, said it was working with Metabiota, which works to manage and mitigate pandemic threats, to develop the insurance products. . “We aim to insure the first four participating states in 2017,” said Richard Wilcox, director general of ARC, in a statement. |Tue Feb 03 11:40:11 +0000 2015||African Union unit says developing epidemic insurance |5.6257627666673664e+17|http://reut.rs/1F1Eoqm
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Britain voted on Tuesday to become the first country to allow a “three-parent” IVF technique which doctors say will prevent some inherited incurable diseases but which critics see as a step towards creating designer babies. . The treatment is known as “three-parent” in vitro fertilisation (IVF) because the babies, born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor. . It is designed to help families with mitochondrial diseases, incurable conditions passed down the maternal line that affect around one in 6,500 children worldwide.  . After an emotionally charged 90-minute debate that some lawmakers criticised as being too short for such a serious matter, parliament voted 382 to 128 in favour of the technique, called mitochondrial donation.  . The vote paves the way for a medical world first for Britain — which along with the United States has been at the forefront of scientific research on the treatments — but one that is fiercely disputed by some religious groups and other critics. . The process involves intervening in the fertilisation process to remove mitochondria, which act as tiny energy-generating batteries inside cells, and which, if faulty, can cause inherited conditions such as fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. . Mitochondrial DNA is separate from DNA found in the cell nucleus and does not affect human characteristics such as hair or eye colour, appearance or personality traits.  . “I wouldn’t stand here and defend the concept of designer babies — choosing the colour of the eyes and all the rest of it. This is about purely dealing with those terrible, terrible illnesses,” opposition Labour lawmaker Andrew Miller, chair of parliament’s science and technology committee, told the debate. . International charities, advocacy groups and scientists had urged Britain to pass laws to allow the treatment, saying it brought a “first glimmer of hope” for some families of having a baby who could live without suffering. . “We have finally reached a milestone in giving women an invaluable choice, the choice to become a mother without fear of passing on a lifetime under the shadow of mitochondrial disease to their child,” Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said following the vote. . In an open letter to lawmakers, 11 international campaign groups, including the U.S. United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, described the condition as “unimaginably cruel”. . “It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more,” they wrote. . Lawmakers were given a free vote on the issue, and Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman said the British leader had voted to support it, adding it was not “about playing God”. . “He has a particular sympathy with those parents whose children are born with very serious illnesses, that in nearly all cases end their lives prematurely,” the spokesman said, referring to Cameron’s son Ivan who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy and died aged six in 2009. . Proposed new laws allowing the treatments to be carried out in Britain still have to be approved by the upper house, which commentators expect to endorse parliament’s support.  . Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility clinic and a reproductive ethicist, urged the scientists developing the techniques to continue “to educate and reassure those who continue to have anxieties”.   . The Bishops Conference of England and Wales said the Church opposed the destruction of human embryos as part of the process and hoped treatments for mitochondrial disease could be found. . “The human embryo is a new human life with potential; it should be respected and protected from the moment of conception and not used as disposable material,” Bishop John Sherrington said in a statement.      . Other critics say the technique will lead to the creation of genetically modified “designer babies”, with Conservative lawmaker Fiona Bruce saying it would amount to letting “the genie out of the bottle”. . “Where will it lead? The answer has to be that we stop here. The answer has to be that we say this is a red line in our country, as in every other country in the world, that we will not cross,” she said during the debate. |Tue Feb 03 11:24:26 +0000 2015||Britain votes on allowing world's first three-parent IVF babies |5.625723145635881e+17|http://reut.rs/1AnnjrX
|PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi launched an inhalable insulin in the United States on Tuesday in a potential boost for its flagging diabetes drug sales and for patient quality of life. . Developed by Mannkind Corp, Afrezza will be the only inhalable insulin on the U.S. market, where Sanofi competes with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for sales of traditional injectable insulin. . Inhalation promises to be faster acting and much more convenient than injections, but an inhaled product has failed in the past and there are concerns about the potential risks associated with breathing powdered insulin. . Afrezza, which uses a whistle-sized inhaler and works to control blood-sugar levels in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, was developed in the shadow of Pfizer’s rival Exubera and approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in June. . Exubera was approved in 2006 with expectations of $2 billion a year in sales but the inhaler was bulky, and patients were put off by the need for periodic lung function tests. Eventually it was withdrawn. . In the Afrezza marketing deal struck last year, Mannkind won an upfront payment of $150 million, potential further milestone payments of up to $775 million and 35 percent of future profits. . Priced at $7.54 for a daily dose of 12 units, Afrezza will be pricier than $3.14 Apidra, which is the injectable equivalent in Sanofi’s drugs stable. . Afrezza should not be used in patients with asthma, or those suffering from certain complications, however. It is also not recommended for smokers or recent ex-smokers. . Industry analysts have said they expect Afrezza to generate modest sales of about $182 million a year by 2019 according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, given Exubera’s problems and the restrictions on use. . Sanofi’s diabetes division generates about $7 billion of sales annually and around 30 percent of group profits, but the patent on its Lantus insulin, the world’s most prescribed, expires this year, and it expects little or no sales growth through 2018. . A poor diabetes performance in 2014 was one of the reasons Sanofi sacked chief executive Chris Viehbacher in October. The company is now betting on products like Afrezza and an improved version of Lantus called Toujeo. . Orally delivered insulin is difficult to develop because the protein gets broken down in the stomach, but last year Danish group Novo Nordisk completed a Phase I trial of an oral version. |Tue Feb 03 06:22:53 +0000 2015||Sanofi launches inhaled insulin for diabetics |5.624964253394125e+17|http://reut.rs/1F19qyq

Mary Wisniewski|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois will begin issuing licenses to grow and distribute medical marijuana 18 months after a law was signed legalizing it, Governor Bruce Rauner’s general counsel said in a statement on Monday. . Former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, who supported medical marijuana, left office in January without issuing licenses for growth and distribution, leaving it to Rauner, a Republican, who asked for a review of the selection process.  . Quinn’s administration had prepared lists of possible recipients based on scoring of applications. But Rauner’s team’s review concluded that some applicants had been disqualified without clear procedures, giving rise to legal liabilities. . As a result, Rauner issued on Monday a list of growers and dispensary operators who will receive permits and licenses in many areas of the state, with some gaps that will be filled in after review of applications that had been disqualified on Quinn’s preliminary list of recipients. . “Any applicant that was recommended for disqualification will be fully informed of the basis for that decision (and) given an opportunity to respond,” Rauner’s General Counsel Jason Barclay said in the statement. . Marla Levi, 51, a multiple sclerosis patient of Buffalo Grove, Illinois who’s been waiting for legal medical marijuana, said she hopes the right candidates get licenses. “I hope they put patients first, and not money,” she said. . Several months could still go by before medical marijuana is sold in Illinois. Winners must put up a bond, pay license fees and register agents. Also, any marijuana sold in the state must be grown in the state, which takes at least 4-1/2 months. . Illinois is one of 23 states along with the District of Columbia that permit medical marijuana. Illinois’ trial program expires in 2017. |Tue Feb 03 00:36:05 +0000 2015||After long wait, Illinois to issue medical marijuana licenses |5.6240915241763226e+17|http://reut.rs/1F0CYfC
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A day care center at a Southern California high school has been closed after a baby enrolled in the program was diagnosed with measles amid an outbreak that has already infected more than 100 people nationwide, the Los Angeles Times reported on Monday. . The infant was enrolled at the child-care center at Santa Monica High School, where a freshman baseball coach contracted measles last month, the Times reported. It was not immediately clear if the two cases were related. . A spokeswoman for the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School district could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.  . The spokeswoman told the Times that the baby was under the age of 12 months and therefore could not be immunized for measles. . She said that the district was working with health officials to determine the extent of exposure among other enrollees at the day care center and that it was not immediately clear when it would reopen, according to the newspaper. . The California Department of Public Health said on Monday that 92 cases of measles had been confirmed in the state, up from 91 on Friday.  . Fifty-nine of those cases have been epidemiologically linked to an outbreak that public health officials believe began when an infected person visited Disneyland in Anaheim in late December.  . More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 13 other U.S. states and in Mexico. No deaths have been reported. . Measles was officially declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the nation had its highest number of measles cases in two decades. . In addition to California, since December cases of measles have been confirmed in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington state, as well as Mexico. .

|(Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has proposed bringing together the country’s food safety operations into one agency to better monitor food quality in a move that would reshape the Food and Drug Administration. . The proposal was put forward as part of the President’s 2016 budget plan. The new agency would combine the food safety responsibilities of the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies. . “A single Federal food safety agency would provide focused, centralized leadership, a primary voice on food safety standards and compliance with those standards, and clear lines of responsibility and accountability that will enhance both prevention of and responses to outbreaks of food-borne illnesses,” the budget proposal noted. . The President’s proposal reflects provisions in draft bill introduced last month by Democratic Senator Richard Durbin from Illinois and Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut. The bill, introduced as the Safe Food Act of 2015, is designed to improve safety at a time more and more food is being sourced from overseas. . Each year, 48 million people, or 1 in 6 Americans, suffer from foodborne illness. More than 100,000 are hospitalized and thousands die, according to federal data. . In January 2011, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act was signed into law. The goal was to shift the focus of regulators to preventing contamination rather than just responding to it. . Michael Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at the FDA, declined to say whether such a move would be supported by FDA officials. . “It depends on how it’s done,” he said. . While recognizing that food safety is fragmented, he said, the FDA will focus on implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act “while Congress considers what the President has proposed.” . Currently most of the responsibility for food safety lies with the FDA. The Department of Agriculture oversees meat, poultry and processed eggs. . The President’s proposal calls for a single agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency would be independent from the FDA and would be responsible for food safety inspections, enforcement, applied research and responses to food-poisoning outbreaks. |Mon Feb 02 23:51:12 +0000 2015||Obama proposes creation of stand-alone U.S. food safety agency |5.623978558609285e+17|http://reut.rs/1AlsCrR

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . Transgender youngsters identify as much with their genders as do non-transgender children, a new study says. The findings indicate that transgender children are not confused or delayed in their understanding of gender, as some have suggested, write the researchers in Psychological Science. . “People didn’t know how to conceptualize these kids and their experiences,” said Nicholas Eaton, the study’s senior author from Stony Brook University in New York. “People in the scientific community, the society at large and the media didn’t know how to talk about these kids.” . Eaton and his colleagues questioned 32 transgender children, ages five to 12, who all came from supportive homes and had not yet entered puberty.  . The children were asked different types of questions that have been shown in other studies to be measures of implicit gender identity.   . When the researchers looked to see if the transgender children’s responses mirrored those of non-transgender kids - known as cisgender children - they found that transgender boys’ responses mirrored cisgender boys’ answers. Transgender girls responded the same as cisgender girls. . “I think the study speaks to the fact that this isn’t something that’s created or just made up for attention or for any other purpose than an authentic sense of self,” said Dr. Aron Janssen, director of the NYU Langone Medical Center’s Gender and Sexuality Service in New York City. . Janssen, who wasn’t involved with the new study, said young children should be able to explore their gender identities, which don’t need to fall into set definitions of cisgender or transgender. “The cognitions around gender aren’t as fixed as we like to think they are - particularly for kids,” he said, adding that parents should approach gender from a place of curiosity. “Ask a lot of questions and reserve judgment.” . “The one thing that’s incredibly clear in the literature is that parental acceptance is the primary mediator for bad or good outcomes,” he said. . The new study is an example of research in an area where it’s needed, said Dr. Barbara Warren, who wasn’t involved in the new study but is an expert on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender health. She said past research is mostly based on accounts of people’s experiences. . “We have a lot more evidence now that supports that the folks with gender dysphoria show something that’s inborn,” said Warren, director of LGBT Programs and Policies in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. . Eaton said he and his fellow researchers are continuing to enroll transgender children and their families for research. They hope to check in with these children throughout their lives to keep learning from them. . “Unfortunately the trajectory of trans-adult lives are not always positive,” he said, adding that they have an increased risk of suicide and unemployment. “These kids are saying from a very young age that they’re trans and their parents are supporting that. Studying these kids . . . over time can be very informative.” . Janssen said he hopes doctors are now seeing more transgender people when they’re younger, instead of later in life when it may be more difficult to transition.  . “Whatever gender a child chooses should not be a barrier in their lives,” he said. .

Madeline Kennedy|The cost of managing diabetes has more than doubled in the past 20 years, a new analysis says. . The average diabetes patient now spends $2,790 more per year than they did in 1987 - and more than half the additional spending is for medications. . “People need to be mindful about the substantial increase in the cost of diabetes, which has been partially fueled by the rising prices of newer drugs,” said Xiaohui Zhou, a health economist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who led the study. . Zhou and colleagues compared National Medical Expenditure Survey data from 1987, 2000-2001 and 2010-2011. . The 1987 survey, involving 22,538 people, showed that diabetics spent $2,588 per person more on healthcare than people without diabetes. In 2000 and 2010, with more people responding (roughly 39,000 each time), the extra spending by diabetics rose to $4,205 and $5,378, respectively. . When the researchers accounted for factors like age, race, obesity and type of care, 55 percent of spending by diabetic patients was on prescription medication, 24 percent was for inpatient visits, 15 percent was for outpatient visits and 6 percent went toward ER visits and other expenses. . The researchers also asked whether costs were higher because people used health services more, or because the price of the service had risen. The answer: both. Patients now use more medication, and the costs of the drugs have also risen.  . The increased cost of outpatient visits was mainly due to more visits, and inpatient and ER expenses grew as a result of rising prices, they write in the journal Diabetes Care. . The U.S. is not alone in facing this issue. “A growing trend of increased spending on anti-diabetic prescription medications has also been observed in other developed countries,” Zhou said in an email. . Tim Dall, a managing director with IHS Life Sciences who studies the economic side of diabetes care but was not involved in this research, said the American Diabetes Association has previously found that “a large portion of diabetes-related costs are associated with the complications of diabetes rather than with treating diabetes itself.”  . Zhou noted that new drugs and devices are constantly emerging and “patients now receive a more complicated treatment regimen than the past.” Some newer drugs are eight to 10 times the cost of older drugs such as sulfonylureas, Zhou said. . Dall feels that while costs may be great, the benefits of new developments are also substantial. “The average medical cost to treat people with diabetes has been increasing over time, but patients are getting better care and living longer,” he told Reuters Health by email. . However, he said, if a certain regimen is working well for a patient, there may not be a need to upgrade. . Zhou and Dall say more effort needs to be put toward diabetes prevention and not merely management of the disease.  . “This growing trend of diabetes cost is simply unsustainable. Besides the efforts to bend the treatment cost, the efforts to reduce the number of future diabetes patients are imperative,” Zhou said. . SOURCE: .

James Harding Giahyue|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia began a trial of experimental Ebola vaccines on Monday, involving thousands of volunteers as part of an effort to slow the spread of the deadly haemorrhagic fever and prevent future outbreaks. . The epidemic has killed more than 8,800 people in West Africa since it began more than a year ago, overwhelming weak healthcare systems in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Its spread now appears to be slowing, especially in Liberia which currently has just a handful of cases. . The trial to test two vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline and New Link/Merck began at the government-run Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, a cluster of cement blocks in the teeming New Kru Town neighborhood that was one of the first parts of the capital to be struck by the disease.  . “I do not want for Ebola to affect my family and so I have come to volunteer,” said Zolu McGill, among the first batch of four volunteers seen at the hospital by a Reuters reporter. . Scientists say the study, a final stage trial which hopes to involve 27,000 volunteers at the heart of the epidemic after earlier safety trials in the UK, United States and other African countries, could be a turning point in the fight against the deadly virus, which has no known cure.  . But given relatively few new cases in the dwindling outbreak, researchers are concerned the trial in Liberia, plus another planned in Sierra Leone, may not have the statistical power needed to show whether the shots work.   . Volunteers will receive a small compensation package. Each of the vaccines contains a small harmless portion of the Ebola virus and may cause side effects in some people such as pain, redness, fever, headaches, mouth sores, tiredness, muscle, joint pain and loss of appetite. . The Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines (Prevail) says healthy volunteers above 18 years old who have no previous history of the virus will be selected. . Vice President Joseph Boakai said in a speech on Sunday attended by dignitaries that he hoped the successful development of drugs would prevent any other country from suffering the devastation experienced by Liberia. . “It’s our conviction that from this worthy exercise humankind will prevail over the deadly killer of man,” he said. . The slowdown in the epidemic is already hampering drug development. Chimerix Inc said on Friday it was stopping participation in clinical studies in Liberia of a drug, brincidofovir, to treat people who already have Ebola, citing the slump in new cases.   . With that in mind, and looking ahead to future potential outbreaks, scientists are thinking about how to develop and test second-generation Ebola vaccines, which could be used to prevent more strains of the disease than the current fast-tracked shots. . Some scientists and aid workers are calling for trials to begin promptly in neighboring Sierra Leone where transmission hotspots exist around the capital Freetown.   . The U.S. ambassador to Liberia, Deborah Malac, said that cooperation on the vaccines represented an opportunity for greater cooperation between the two countries on clinical research and developing the Liberian health system. . “It’s fantastic that large-scale trials of the first candidate Ebola vaccine are getting underway in Liberia, a country that has suffered enormously at the hands of this disease,” said Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, which is funding a trial of the GSK vaccine in Britain and Mali. |Mon Feb 02 19:41:27 +0000 2015||Liberia begins clinical trial for Ebola vaccines as outbreak ebbs |5.6233500480271155e+17|http://reut.rs/1F07aaR
Sam Wilkin|LONDON (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 presidential contender, on Monday kicked off a fresh debate about vaccinations, saying his children received the recommended shots for measles but that parents needed a measure of choice. . Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 but a recent outbreak in California renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement. Fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, led some parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated  . “There has to be a balance and it depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest,” said Christie, on a trip to the United Kingdom. “I didn’t say I’m leaving people the option. What I’m saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns.” . The trip involved meetings and a tour at a life sciences research park in Cambridge, which prompted questions about the U.S. vaccination debate.  . “All I can say is that we vaccinated ours,” said Christie. “That’s the best expression I can give you of my opinion... But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.” . Democratic New Jersey Assembly man Herb Conaway, criticized Christie’s “wavering comments” as “irresponsible and endanger the health of our communities”. . “The only thing government has to balance is what’s best for the overall public health, and that means unambiguously supporting vaccinations,” Conaway said in a statement.  . Christie is in the UK - his state’s third-largest trading partner after Canada and Mexico - to promote his state’s life sciences industry. He will also be meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron.  . In comments which seemed a nod toward his own expected presidential ambitions, Christie said the White House needs an effective negotiator to facilitate trade agreements - which he argued was currently lacking. . Christie said this was the first hurdle to making progress on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - a proposed trade agreement between the European Union and the United States which U.S. President Barack Obama has been advocating.  . “That’s the first hurdle (to TTIP), you need someone in the White House who is going to be an effective negotiator,” Christie told reporters in London.  . “We’re far away from that at the moment in terms of the perception, and I believe the reality, of the President’s ability and skill to negotiate,” Christie said.  . Republican Christie, 52, in January formed a political action committee ahead of a potential bid for president in 2016, where he would be jostling with other likely contenders such as Jeb Bush and Scott Walker.   |Mon Feb 02 18:18:01 +0000 2015||New Jersey Governor seeks 'balance' in vaccine debate |5.6231400787777946e+17|http://reut.rs/1EZVQeM
Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - Doctors say that when patients are seriously ill, the main obstacles to discussing what the goals of care should be are family disagreement and patient denial. . “It’s a difficult time,” said lead author Dr. John J. You of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in a phone interview. “But that means we need to be there with extra support and profoundly good skills.” . In 2012 and 2013, You and his team surveyed more than 1,000 clinicians, including nurses, residents and staff physicians, at 13 university-based hospitals in Canada, asking them to rate the importance of 21 potential barriers to goals-of-care discussions with seriously ill hospitalized patients.  . One such patient, for example, might be a housebound 70-year-old with severe lung disease who uses oxygen at home and has been hospitalized in worsening condition. . On average, clinicians said the most severe barriers to discussing the goals of care were family members’ difficulty accepting a loved one’s poor prognosis, difficulty understanding the limitations of life-sustaining therapies, and lack of agreement about goals of care, and the patient’s trouble understanding or accepting their prognosis.  . Other obstacles, like physician lack of time, language barriers, lack of training and desire to avoid being sued, were rated as less important, according to results in JAMA Internal Medicine.  . “Are we in the medical field pointing the finger at patients?” asked Dr. James N. Kirkpatrick of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who wrote an editorial about the study. . “It’s difficult to say where exactly the fault lies,” Kirkpatrick told Reuters Health by phone. . “The problem is that we are very focused on the next intervention, or drug, or device,” he said. “We’ll make people live longer but we kind of don’t think beyond that,” though that is changing, he said. . There will have to be a broad range of solutions to make sure care goal discussions happen in the hospital, You said. . Conversations in the hospital, in the middle of a crisis, “can be a lot easier and more productive if there has been more advanced care planning upstream before patients land in the hospital, and if we normalize conversation about death and dying, which is inevitable,” he said. . Goals of care are different from an advanced directive, he noted. . “Oftentimes we view the advanced directive discussions in terms of a one shot deal, we don’t really look at it as a process,” he said. “Decision making is a process.” . All the clinicians rated physicians as the most acceptable professional group to take charge of communicating with patients about care plans. They also often felt it would be acceptable for others, like nurses and social workers, to initiate the discussions and be a decision coach. . “Physicians still need to have critical roles, but there are underused and under recognized skill sets in other positions,” like nurses, You said. . “As a physician we tend to see that it’s only our responsibility, which can be a heavy burden,” You said.  .

David Morgan|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Monday it would seek authority to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs under the government’s Medicare Part D program, which offers private drug coverage for senior citizens and the disabled. . President Barack Obama’s new $3.99 trillion budget for fiscal-year 2016  proposes allowing the U.S. secretary for health and human services to negotiate prices for biotechnology treatments and other high-cost drugs in Part D “to ensure access to and affordability of these treatments.” . But the plan would require the administration to get a green light from Congress, where Republicans who control the House of Representatives and Senate have openly favored market forces over government intervention as a vehicle for containing healthcare costs. . Congress prohibited Medicare from negotiating directly with drug companies in 2003 when it created Part D under then-President George W. Bush. .  The drug industry’s main lobbying group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, warned that the president’s budget plan contained “harmful proposals that fundamentally alter the structure of the Medicare Part D program,” including one that would reduce patent protection on brand-name biotechnology drugs.    . Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she hoped talks with lawmakers would lead to a detailed plan, describing negotiations as an important element of the administration’s goal of containing costs across the healthcare system.   . “This is about us trying to find ways that we can continue with what we have talked about as a real priority for us,” she told reporters. . The budget plan projects a 30 percent rise in Part D drug benefits, from $63.3 billion this year to $82.5 billion in 2016, partly due to the rising cost of specialty drugs.   . Biotechnology treatments, or biologics, are generally patented, genetically engineered drugs that can be more effective than traditional medicine.  . But they can also be more expensive because they are more complex to manufacture. Some biologics play a role in precision medicine, which seeks to better tailor treatments to individual patients based on their genetic makeup and other influences. Obama last week proposed $215 billion in government funding to support genetic-based treatments.   . The proposal to allow drug price negotiations follows a campaign by private insurers and pharmacy benefits companies against Gilead Sciences Inc’s $84,000 hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.  . U.S. payers argued that the drug, which cures nearly all patients of the liver-wasting disease, could cost $200 billion to cover the entire hepatitis C population, an unsustainable sum for society. |Mon Feb 02 16:59:15 +0000 2015||Obama administration seeks to negotiate Medicare drug prices |5.622941844226826e+17|http://reut.rs/1EZKlnJ
Kathryn Doyle|Reuters Health - In the U.S., commercial foods for toddlers often have high amounts of sodium or added sugars, a new study shows. . For younger babies, most commercial foods were low in sodium and the majority of infant meals, vegetables, fruits, and dry infant cereals did not contain added sugars, which is good news, said lead researcher Mary E. Cogswell of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. . But the situation was more troubling for toddler foods. . “It was surprising that more than seven of 10 packaged toddler meals contained too much sodium,” Cogswell told Reuters Health by email.  . Also, she said, “a substantial proportion of toddler foods and infant and toddler snacks, even those we don’t think of as sweet – like toddler meals and salty snacks – contained at least one added sugar.” . “A healthy diet for the entire family, one that is limited in added salt and sugar and rich in fruits and vegetables, can help set taste preferences of the youngest family members eating from the table and ultimately prevent chronic diseases related to poor food choices,” Cogswell said. . Recommended daily sodium intake ranges from 120 milligrams (mg) for infants 0 to 6 months, to 370 mg for ages 7 to 12 months and 1,000 mg ages 1 to 3 years, Cogswell said. . Using a 2012 database of more than 1,000 packaged infant and toddler foods and drinks sold in the U.S., the researchers found that almost all of the more than 600 vegetables, dinners, dry cereals and ready to serve grains and fruit geared to infants under age 1 were low sodium, and none were high sodium.  . But nearly three-quarters of toddler dinners geared to kids age 1 to 3 were high sodium, meaning they contained more than 210 mg of sodium per serving, according to results in Pediatrics. . The researchers also flagged foods with more than 35 percent of their total calories from sugar, or at least one source of added sugars, like corn syrup, high- fructose corn syrup, honey and fructose. . Most infant vegetables, dinners, fruits and cereals did not contain added sugars. But half of the ready-to-serve mixed grains and fruits had at least one added sugar source, and often more than 35 percent of total calories came from sugar. . For toddlers, most savory snacks, desserts and juices or drinks contained at least one added sugar, and 61 percent of dairy-based desserts contained at least 1 added sugar and 35 percent of calories from sugar, the authors write.  . “Regretfully, parents need to read labels carefully to avoid added salt and sugars in food commercially prepared for toddlers,” said Dr. Susan S. Baker of the Digestive Diseases and Nutrition Center at the University at Buffalo in New York, in email to Reuters Health. Baker coauthored an editorial published with the report. . The most common added sugars were fruit juice concentrate, sugar, cane, syrup and malt. . Studies have found similar results in Canada and the UK, Cogswell said. . “When you buy processed or packaged foods, read the nutrition panel and look for those labeled ‘low-sodium’ or ‘no salt’ or ‘no sugar added,’” Cogswell advises.  . “An easy tip for parents is to focus on the amount of sodium per serving,” she added. “Those foods with less than 140 mg per serving are considered low in sodium.” .

Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - With High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which consists of short bursts of intensive activity followed by short periods of  recovery, fitness experts say the harder the push, the greater the reward.  . HIIT can blast calories, build muscle and boost endurance with impressive efficiency in just 20 minutes a day, but the catch is finding the right level of intensity outside the comfort zone, fitness trainers say. . Sean Bartram, author of the book “High Intensity Interval Training for Women,” said to find that level people should think about what it is like being chased by a rabid dog. . “It’s just below that,” he said. “To gain maximum benefits you have to push your body to a place that’s almost uncomfortable.”  . The American College of Sports Medicine predicts HIIT will be a top fitness trend in 2015. Bartram said people are drawn to it for its efficiency and almost endless variety of exercises. . The bursts can be sprinting or spot jumps and the recovery can be rests or slower paced movements, he explained. . “You could alternate 30 seconds of sprinting with 30 seconds of walking, or you could engage in a series of bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups, doing each for 30 seconds with 10 seconds of rest in between,” he said. . Dr. Michele Olson, a professor of exercise science at Auburn University at Montgomery, Alabama, said it’s not high intensity unless the heart rate is elevated to near 90-plus percentage of its maximum. . “Many people think they are engaging in HIIT but they are really doing traditional interval training, where the heart rate is around 75 to 85 percent of max,” she said. . Maximum heart rate is about 220 minus age, according to the American Heart Association.  . Olson said that if done properly, HIIT can increase the effectiveness in losing abdominal fat and prompt favorable changes in cholesterol and insulin levels. . “There is research showing that you can cut your exercise time nearly in half,” she said.  . About 20 minutes of HIIT can reap similar benefits of doing 35 to 40 minutes of moderate, steady-state cardio, she added, noting the training level must be intense. . Hayley Zawadzki, personal training manager at New York Health and Racquet Club fitness centers, suggests that anyone starting HIIT should have a fitness analysis. . “If you have a history of high blood pressure or medications, you cannot push to the absolute max,” she said. |Mon Feb 02 13:32:09 +0000 2015||Key to High Intensity Interval Training found outside comfort zone |5.622420685848658e+17|http://reut.rs/1EZhvDM
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has designated BlueBird Bio Inc’s blood disorder drug a breakthrough therapy, speeding up the treatment’s development process. . The company’s shares rose nearly 7 percent in premarket trading. . Breakthrough therapy designation is based on initial trial data and granted to drugs with the potential to treat serious diseases better than existing therapies. . BlueBird’s drug, LentiGlobin, aims to treat beta-thalassemia — a disease that results in lower levels of hemoglobin in the blood. The disease is caused by mutations in the human beta-globin gene. . Low levels of hemoglobin cause thalassemia patients to suffer from weakness, fatigue and other serious complications. . The therapy involves the insertion of a functional human beta-globin gene into the patient’s stem cells, which are then retransplanted into the patient. . The treatment is currently in early-stage trials. |Mon Feb 02 13:32:09 +0000 2015||BlueBird's rare blood disorder drug gets breakthrough therapy status |5.622420666974454e+17|http://reut.rs/1AiGDX8
|LONDON (Reuters) - A second British military healthcare worker has been flown back to England from Sierra Leone following the likely exposure to the Ebola virus, a government agency said on Monday. . Public Health England said the worker had likely been exposed to the virus from a needle injury while treating a patient with Ebola. The worker has not been diagnosed with the virus and does not have any symptoms. . Another healthcare worker was flown back on Saturday following a similar injury and both are being tested at the Royal Free hospital in London. . “Although we have had two similar incidents within a short space of time both appear to be unrelated,” minister for the Armed Forces Mark Francois said in a statement. . “Our personnel receive the highest standard of training and briefing prior to deployment, including on the use of the specialized Personal Protective Equipment”. . Two other Britons have already been successfully treated at the Royal Free hospital for the virus and have been released. |Mon Feb 02 11:08:05 +0000 2015||Second British health worker tested for Ebola in London |5.622058116495483e+17|http://reut.rs/1EZ3PbS
Kate Kelland|LONDON, (Reuters) - Campaigners urged British lawmakers on Sunday to seize a chance to become the first in the world to allow three-way fertility treatments to families who want to avoid passing on incurable diseases to their children. . In an open letter ahead of a parliamentary vote scheduled for Tuesday, charities and advocacy groups said the opportunity “offers families the first glimmer of hope that they might be able to have a baby that will live without pain and suffering.” . The technique under debate is known as mitochondrial donation and is often referred to as three-parent in vitro fertilization (IVF) because the offspring would have genes from a mother, a father and from a female donor. . The process, still only at the research stage in Britain and the United States, involves intervening in the fertilization process to remove faulty mitochondrial DNA, which can cause inherited conditions such as fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy.  . It is feared by critics who say it effectively allows “designer babies” because it would involve implanting genetically modified embryos into women. . Britain last February set out draft legislation that, if passed, would make it the first country to allow the technique. . In their letter, groups including the U.S.-based United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, the Australian Mitochondrial Disease Foundation and groups from France, Germany, Britain and Spain, described mitochondrial disease as “unimaginably cruel”. . “It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more,” they wrote. . They said they were aware “that no novel medical procedure is without risk”, but had “absolute confidence” in scientific panels that have examined the technique. . The issue of mitochondrial donation has been scrutinized by several expert panels in Britain, including the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. . Many scientists and medics have welcomed the government’s decision to push ahead. . Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it would “allow the law to catch up with public and scientific opinion”. . “Parents who know what it means to care for a sick and suffering child with mitochondrial disease are the people best placed to decide ... whether mitochondrial donation is right for them,” he said. “It is time to allow them to make that choice.” |Sun Feb 01 13:38:13 +0000 2015||International campaigners urge UK to allow '3-parent' IVF babies |5.6188120616668365e+17|http://reut.rs/1EXx3YI
|LONDON (Reuters) - Motif Bio, which is working on a range of antibiotics, is planning to raise at least 4 million pounds ($6 million) - and potentially up to 16 million - through a stock market listing in London. . The plan shows increased interest in badly needed new antibiotics that are seen as essential to counter the spread of “superbug” bacteria. . Companies have for many years been reluctant to invest because of poor returns, but recently the promise of improved incentives has started to change the mood as demonstrated most vividly by Merck & Co’s decision to acquire Cubist for $9.5 billion in December. . Motif Bio said it was in talks with investors ahead its move to list on the AIM market as it seeks funding to advance its experimental drugs.  . If it raises the full 16 million pounds, either at or after flotation, the business is expected to be worth 45-60 million pounds. . The company said its most advanced drug candidate, iclaprim, was expected to move into advanced Phase III trials in the second half of this year and could be ready for commercialization within three years. . It is also working on several earlier-stage drugs. . Motif Bio, which is led by former Merck executive and one-time vet Graham Lumsden, is buying rights to iclaprim through the purchase of U.S. firm Nuprim in a deal that will be completed once the company lists on AIM. . Iclaprim was previously submitted to U.S. regulators but turned down in 2009. Motif Bio believes it can get the drug approved by addressing certain shortfalls in the original development program. .

Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - As West Africa’s devastating Ebola outbreak begins to dwindle, scientists are looking beyond the endgame at the kind of next-generation vaccines needed for a vital stockpile to hit another epidemic hard and fast. . Determined not to lose scientific momentum that could make the world’s first effective Ebola interventions a reality, researchers say the shots, as well as being proven to work, must be cheap, easy to handle in Africa and able to hit multiple virus strains. . That may mean shifting focus from the stripped-down, fast-tracked vaccine development ideas that have dominated the past six months, but it mustn’t mean the field gets bogged down in complexities. . “We need a stockpile because there will be other outbreaks,” said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI global immunization alliance, which helps bulk-buy vaccines for poor countries. . The experimental vaccines now moving into large clinical trials in West Africa target the current Ebola Zaire virus strain, but the next outbreak may be different. . “We need to work with the pharmaceutical industry to create second-generation vaccines that would cover not just Ebola Zaire but also Ebola Sudan and perhaps Marburg, perhaps Lassa. The idea is to have vaccines that will work across different places,” Berkley said. . Right now, scientists are grappling with several tricky issues — partly due to success in cutting new infections in the vast Ebola outbreak. . With relatively few new cases, big trials in Liberia and Sierra Leone to test the first generation single-dose one strain vaccines may not have the statistical power needed to show whether the shots work. . And already, early data from safety trials in humans suggest a single-dose vaccination with the most advanced vaccine, from GlaxoSmithKline, may not provoke an immune response strong enough to protect people exposed to the virus. . “We now know you get around 10 times fewer antibodies in humans (than in monkeys) and probably five times fewer T-cells,” said Adrian Hill of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, referring to two key elements of the immune system. . This strongly suggests that a two-dose regime, or a so-called “prime-boost” approach, is the one likely to prove effective, Hill said. . These and other issues add up to a sizeable to do list for scientists focusing on vaccines for future stockpiles. . Producing multi-strain, or multivalent, vaccines that could protect against different types of Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers will be more time consuming than making today’s monovalent shots, but it is by no means impossible. . In fact, several of the candidate Ebola vaccines being fast-tracked through testing started out as multivalents before being stripped back to deal with the current outbreak. . Another challenge is ensuring vaccines have a long shelf-life and can be easily transported in the tropics. At the moment, test shots are kept at -70 or -80 degrees Celsius, although Johnson & Johnson says its Ebola vaccine can be stored at normal fridge temperature for many weeks. . Producing adequate volumes, however, looks manageable. Hopefully, the next time Ebola emerges from Africa’s forests it will be spotted earlier and immunization will be needed for perhaps tens of thousands of people — nothing like the tens of millions who would need vaccines in a worldwide flu pandemic. . Finally companies still need a regulatory green light, which gets tricky if large-scale trials fail to produce clear proof that the shots are both safe and effective in people. . Researchers and drugmakers say, however, that regulators have made clear stockpile Ebola vaccines could be approved on efficacy data from tests in monkeys or other non-human primates plus proof of safety and immune response in humans, reflecting contingency plans for vaccines designed for bioterror attacks. . Pursuing tomorrow’s vaccines is not to say one of today’s monovalent shots from GSK, Merck or J&J might not yet have a role in ring-fencing lingering pockets of infection in the current epidemic, and perhaps finally stamping it out. . “I’m pretty optimistic there’s still a role for vaccination in ending this outbreak,” said Hill. “And I’m certainly optimistic that we’ll learn for the next outbreak which of these vaccine approaches is the most likely to work, and be ready to tackle it early on.” |Sun Feb 01 12:14:58 +0000 2015||In pursuit of next-generation Ebola stockpile vaccines |5.61860255005823e+17|http://reut.rs/1Aewnz7
|BEIJING (Reuters) - China has listed food safety and modernizing farms as among key priorities this year, its 2015 rural policy outline showed, as it tackles falling agricultural productivity that has raised concerns about its future food supply. . The “number one document”, issued every January and released by state news agency Xinhua on Sunday, showed China will also protect farmland and lend more to farmers to narrow a wealth gap between rural and urban areas. . Attempts to clean up land that has been damaged by heavy metal mining and processing will be widened this year, and “permanent farmland” that is off-limit to industrial and urban development will be created, the document said. . Modern farms will be set up, and regulation of the quality of food and other farm products will be enhanced, it said. . On land reforms, aimed at allowing farmers to trade their land to alleviate poverty and create bigger and more efficient farms, the document said the focus is on expanding an experiment that registers land usage rights to cover entire provinces. . Chinese farmers typically hold long-term land use contracts allocated by the government, which allow them to farm the land but not sell it. . China has been struggling to squeeze as much food out of its dwindling, contaminated land as possible as demand increases from ever-expanding urban regions.  . About a third of China’s population lives in rural areas, according to a Reuters estimate. Many young people have migrated to cities, reducing productivity on farms and raising concerns about the country’s future food output. . More infrastructure will be built in rural areas, including laying water pipes, upgrading existing power grids, or constructing networks for alternative energy such as hydro and solar power. . Private investment in farms will be encouraged, and authorities will experiment with ways to provide cheaper financing options to more farmers, the document said. . China Development Bank, which makes large infrastructure investment at home and abroad and lends at the behest of China’s government to support its policies, will have to increase mid- and long-term infrastructure loans to rural areas, it said. . The Postal Savings Bank of China, which serves low-income entrepreneurs, will be encouraged to expand in villages, the document showed. . Agricultural businesses that meet undisclosed criteria will also be encouraged to sell bonds, and the leasing of big farm equipment will be tested. .

|LONDON (Reuters) - A British military healthcare worker was flown back to England from Sierra Leone on Saturday following a needle-stick injury sustained while treating a person with Ebola, the Public Health England (PHE) service said on Saturday. . The patient, who has not been named, has been taken for testing to the Royal Free Hospital in London. . “They are likely to have been exposed to the Ebola virus but, at this time, have not been diagnosed with Ebola and do not have symptoms,” PHE said in a statement. . Last week, a British nurse who had been critically ill with Ebola after working in Sierra Leone was discharged from the same hospital after making a full recovery.   . The Royal Free, Britain’s main center for Ebola cases, also successfully treated British aid worker William Pooley who contracted the virus in West Africa last year. . To date, more than 21,700 cases of Ebola have been reported in nine countries, including nearly 8,650 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, although it said this week it believed the disease was declining. |Sat Jan 31 12:09:45 +0000 2015||British health worker being tested for Ebola after needle injury |5.614965560343306e+17|http://reut.rs/1AaDjgF
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - More than 100 people in the United States have been confirmed as infected with measles including 91 in California, most of them linked to an outbreak that began at Disneyland in December, public health officials said on Friday. . The California Department of Public Health said at least 58 of the cases of the highly infectious disease in the state have been epidemiologically linked to the Disneyland cluster. More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 13 other U.S. states and in Mexico. . No deaths have been reported in connection with the outbreak, which public health officials suspect began when an infected person from outside the United States visited Disneyland in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20. . The White House on Friday urged parents to heed the advice of public health officials and scientists in getting their children vaccinated.  . “People should evaluate this for themselves with a bias toward good science and toward the advice of our public health professionals,” President Barack Obama’s spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. . Asked whether people should be getting vaccinated, Earnest said: “That’s what the science indicates.”  . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons.      . Earnest said Obama believes decisions about vaccinating children should rest with parents but that “the president believes that everybody should be listening to our public health professionals.” Earnest said the White House will continue to closely monitor the outbreak.  . Earnest’s comments came one day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to get vaccinated for measles. . Measles was officially declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the nation had its highest number of measles cases in two decades. . In addition to California, since December cases of measles have been confirmed in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington state, as well as Mexico. . Most people recover within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. |Sat Jan 31 01:34:57 +0000 2015||More than 100 cases of measles now confirmed in U.S |5.613368043356979e+17|http://reut.rs/1EV8j3p
Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Two patients hospitalized in Sacramento, California, and tested for possible Ebola infection were found to be free of the deadly virus within hours of each other on Friday. . The first patient, whose case came to light on Thursday, was transferred that day to the University of California-Davis Medical Center from a smaller hospital after having traveled recently in West Africa and exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, officials said. . Test results for that individual came back negative on Friday morning. . Within hours, the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento Medical Center reported it had admitted a second patient for Ebola testing on Wednesday at the request of state public health authorities and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Later on Friday, Kaiser announced that the second patient also had been found to be clear of infection and was being discharged. A UC Davis spokeswoman said its patient remained hospitalized there for the time being.  . Health authorities would not say whether they believed the two cases to be related or whether the second patient had traveled recently in West Africa, epicenter of the worst Ebola epidemic on record, as had the first. Kaiser made no mention of any symptoms. . No information about either individual’s identity, background or even gender was released. . The back-to-back Ebola inquiries came five months after another person in Sacramento was hospitalized for testing and also found free of the disease. . At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States, four of them diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil, during a West African epidemic that has killed at least 8,800 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. . Only two people are known to have contracted the virus in the United States - both of them nurses who treated an Ebola patient from Liberia who became sick while visiting Dallas. That man, Thomas Duncan, died in October. . The Atlanta-based CDC gave approval to Sacramento County Public Health Department in the past month to test blood samples of potential Ebola cases in its own laboratory rather than requiring samples to be sent to the CDC for analysis, said Laura McCasland, a county spokeswoman said. . The new protocol reduces the turnaround time for such lab results from days to about 24 hours, she said. |Sat Jan 31 00:36:23 +0000 2015||Second California patient tests negative for Ebola hours after first |5.6132206247244186e+17|http://reut.rs/1A8TSJS

Steve Ginsburg|(Reuters) - Two-time Super Bowl champion Leonard Marshall is teaming up with the lawyer who first sued the NFL over concussions to form an educational road show on how to avoid and treat head injuries in sports. . The target audience for the Brain Unity Trust is players, coaches and organizations, said Marshall, who suffers from CTE-related illnesses, perhaps from concussions during his 12 seasons as a defensive lineman in the National Football League in the 1980s and ‘90s. . Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain often found in athletes who suffered repetitive brain trauma. . “Leonard never had an opportunity to realize that he had an injury, that it was a problem,” said Pittsburgh lawyer Jason Luckasevic, who first sued the NFL in 2011 over concussions. . “He was told that that was part of the process. You see stars, you take an Advil and that’s it. There’s nothing wrong with you.” . Marshall, 53, who suffers from mood swings and erratic behavior, recalls the brain-jarring hits he endured during a decade of punishing practices with the New York Giants. . “First thing we did after we stretched in the morning, (coach) Bill Parcells would blow the whistle and he’d line up 14 guys across from each other,” said Marshall. “He’d say, ‘It’s party time, boys. I want to see who’s going to quit first.’” . The object was for the players to batter each other and “and for how long,” Marshall said. . “Was it fair? No. But it happened,” he said. . Joining Marshall and Luckasevic in the non-profit start-up is Roberto Clemente Jr., son of the late Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Famer, who has developed an online program that can determine brain function over time. . Luckasevic insists the panel will not bash the NFL but demonstrate how to avoid hard hits. It will also show participants how to deal with concussions. . Medical experts will join the group at each stop. . “When we explain to people what this is, there is absolutely no negative connotation,” Luckasevic said. “The only way the NFL should be mentioned is that we’re going to help people make it there because they’re not going to be playing the game with a brain injury.” . The NFL has agreed to pay up to $5 million to each former player developing neurological impairment in a settlement that is under judicial review. . Brain Unity Trust plans to hit the road this spring. |Fri Jan 30 23:06:21 +0000 2015||Ex-Super Bowl champ Leonard Marshall to teach about concussions |5.6129940774086656e+17|http://reut.rs/1A8zNU1
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Overweight children are just as likely as thin children to have celiac disease, a new study confirms. . It’s a common misconception - even among many doctors - that celiac disease is limited to people who are underweight. . “Being overweight certainly does not exclude the diagnosis, as this paper shows,” said Dr. Peter Green, director of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, who was not involved in the new study. . Between 0.5 percent and 1 percent of people living in the developed world are thought to have celiac disease, in which gluten in food triggers a damaging immune response in the small intestines. . Patients with celiac disease often, but not always, have diarrhea. They also have trouble absorbing nutrients from food.  . To find out the prevalence of celiac disease among overweight and obese children, Dr. Raffaella Nenna and colleagues used data collected at a nutrition center at the University of Rome between 1998 and 2003, from 1,527 overweight and obese children and young adults between the ages of two and about 24 years.  . Seventeen children, or about 1 percent, tested positive for celiac disease through blood work and damage to their small intestines, the authors reported in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. . Those who tested positive for celiac disease were invited to start a nutritionally-balanced gluten-free diet, according to the researchers. . The children who had symptoms of celiac disease reported improvement once they started the gluten-free diet. They also tended to lose weight. . “There are two things when you go on a gluten free diet,” said Green. “You need to learn what to avoid and what to eat. Patients will often get information on how to make a gluten-free diet a healthy diet.” . He added that people with celiac disease are encouraged to see a nutrition specialist when starting a gluten-free diet so they don’t just replace what they’re currently eating with junk food. . Green also said it’s important that people – including doctors – don’t discount a person’s potential celiac symptoms based on appearance. . “The clinical manifestations are very diverse,” he said. “Physicians just looking at a patient can’t say they couldn’t have it if they’re overweight or tall.” .

Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Shire Plc’s stimulant Vyvanse to treat binge-eating disorder, the first product to be approved for the condition. . Vyvanse, which is currently approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, generated sales of more than $1 billion in the first nine months of last year. . Dr. Flemming Ornskov, the company’s chief executive officer, said in an interview that Shire’s goal is to generate overall sales of $10 billion by 2020. Of that, he expects $200 million to $300 million to come from Vyvanse for binge-eating. . Peak annual sales could be significantly higher, he added, as awareness of the condition increases. . Binge-eating disorder, characterized by repeated episodes of uncontrolled eating, accompanied by guilt and shame, affects roughly 2.8 million people in the United States, according to Shire. . “Binge eating can cause serious health problems and difficulties with work, home, and social life,” said Dr. Mitchell Mathis, director of the FDA’s division of psychiatry products. “The approval of Vyvanse provides physicians and patients with an effective option to help curb episodes of binge eating.” . In clinical studies, patients taking Vyvanse were shown to have significantly fewer binge days per week than those taking a placebo. . At the time of entry to the study, the average number of binge days per week was 4.79. At week 12, average binge days per week had fallen to less than one. Patients taking a placebo, by comparison, saw a reduction of little more than 2 days a week.     . Vyvanse is an amphetamine which, like other amphetamines, carries the potential for abuse and addiction. They also have been associated with increase blood press sure and heart rate, sudden death, stroke, heart attack, insomnia and psychiatric side effects such as hallucinations and mania. . The drug is not approved for weight loss. .

Susan Heavey|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With U.S. measles cases on the rise, the White House on Friday urged parents to heed the advice of public health officials and scientists in getting their children vaccinated.  . “People should evaluate this for themselves with a bias toward good science and toward the advice of our public health professionals,” President Barack Obama’s spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. . Asked whether people should be getting vaccinated, Earnest said: “That’s what the science indicates.” . “The science on this is really clear,” Earnest added.  . The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated. . Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons. Scientists defend the safety of vaccines. . Earnest’s comments came one day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to get vaccinated for measles. The highly contagious disease was officially declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. . Earnest said the White House will continue to closely monitor the current outbreak that has sickened more than 90 people in California and other states. Most of those cases are linked to infections that public health officials suspect were caused by an infected person from another country who visited the Disneyland theme park outside Los Angeles in December. . The United States last year had its highest number of measles cases in two decades. . Earnest, speaking at a daily briefing, said Obama believes decisions over vaccinating children should rest with parents. But he added that “the president believes that everybody should be listening to our public health professionals.” . Symptoms of measles include rash and fever, and the airborne virus can spread swiftly among unvaccinated people. . Most people recover within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. It can cause serious complications such as blindness and pneumonia in those who are malnourished or have weaker immune systems. |Fri Jan 30 21:42:58 +0000 2015||White House urges parents to heed advice urging childhood vaccines |5.6127842342405734e+17|http://reut.rs/1A8g3QC
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – A new piece of technology that tracks  eye movements after a head injury might be able to detect concussions and determine their severity, researchers say. . The new technology is essentially like a doctor moving a finger in front of a person’s eyes after a hit to the head - except now it’s automated, said Dr. Uzma Samadani of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.  . And the results are reproducible, whereas with the follow-my-finger method, Samadani said, “Each doctor is going to have variability in how well they’re going to be able to assess how well a person is getting better.” . Samadani said she developed the new technology because she needed a reliable way to assess concussions. Accurate diagnoses would improve patients’ care, allowing for more accurate assessments of when they could safely return to work or play after a hit to the head, she said. . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a concussion as a type of brain injury “caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head that can change the way your brain normally works.”  . In her team’s study, 75 people who’d been in accidents (but not necessarily head accidents) plus 64 healthy volunteers all watched a four-minute video while their eye movement was tracked by a computer. The computer could tell when their eyes are moving in opposite directions. So-called disconjugated eye movement has been tied to brain injuries for centuries. . People with hits to the head had less ability to control their eye movements, compared to people who had no known injuries, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Neurotrauma. . The computer also detected signs of concussion in some patients without any noticeable brain injury on a CT scan.  . Images, like those from a CT scan, “tell you what (the brain) looks like – not how it functions,” Samadani said. . The researchers also found that the severity of symptoms from concussion was tied to the severity of their eye movement problems. . The technology is currently only available in research settings, but Samadani hopes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will clear it for use by the end of this year. . “I think we’re going to change how we diagnose and define brain injury and concussion,” she said. . Future research needs to focus on other factors that may influence the results of the test, such as alcohol, morphine and sleep deprivation. . “What we’re finding so far is that these things affect eye movement, but in different ways than brain injury does,” Samadani said. “So we’re hoping to tease out the differences.” .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – A week before the Super Bowl, a new study suggests that players’ performances may depend at least in part on how the game’s timing aligns with their body clocks. . Athletes’ performances are best predicted by how long it’s been since their body’s natural wake-up time, researchers found. . “The reason why we did this study is that all the existing literature talking about circadian rhythm in sports performance came to the same conclusion: that athletes give their best performance in the evening,” said Roland Brandstaetter, the study’s senior author from the University of Birmingham in the UK. . As reported in the journal Current Biology, Brandstaetter and colleagues studied the performance of 121 athletes who competed in competitions. . When the researchers separated the athletes into three groups based on their internal clocks, they found that those who naturally get up early reached peak performance in the early afternoon. Those who naturally sleep the latest would likely reach their peak in the evening. . Specifically, natural early and intermediate risers reached their peak performances about six hours after their internal wakeup time. Late risers reached their peaks about 11 hours after their internal wakeup time. . Overall, the researchers found that individual performance during the day can vary by 7 to 10 percent among early and intermediate risers, and by up to 26 percent among late risers. . The researchers say that just a 1 percent improvement among the fourth place athletes in the women’s road race, 400 meter swim or 400 meter sprint at the 2008 Olympics may have propelled them to a gold medal. . Brandstaetter said the improvements in peak performance may easily apply to areas other than sports. . “Physical performance and mental performance go hand in hand,” he said. “If you’re physically exhausted, then your brain isn’t working either. . . . Also, if you’re mentally tired, you won’t be at the top of your physical performance.” . While it’s possible to change the body’s internal clock, Brandstaetter said it takes time. . “If you just change your wakeup time on the day of the competition or the day of your performance, it wouldn’t make much of a difference,” he said. “You would need to start in advance and retrain your biological clock.” . Brandstaetter said it might be difficult for people to know when their internal wakeup times are. It’s not simply the time the alarm clock goes off in the morning. . “If you’re really agenda free and not going out until one o’clock in the morning, then you start getting an idea about it,” he said. . “Try to listen and understand your internal biological clock,” Brandstaetter said. “Try to live with it instead of trying to live against it.” .

|SEATTLE (Reuters) - The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said on Friday it had awarded Stanford University a $50 million grant to accelerate vaccine development efforts for the world’s most deadly diseases, including AIDS and malaria. . The $50 million grant over 10 years will go toward establishing the Stanford Human Systems Immunology Center on the school’s California campus, the foundation and university said in a statement. . The center will focus research on how the immune system can be harnessed to develop vaccines for the world’s most deadly infectious diseases, the university said. . “While illnesses like polio and measles are now readily preventable, scientists have been stymied in their efforts to fight diseases such as HIV and malaria,” according to the statement. . Stanford said cost and the amount of time needed for research have been obstacles in developing new vaccinations. The $50 million gift will help scientists research and prioritize the most promising vaccines for clinical trials. . “What we need is a new generation of vaccines and new approaches to vaccination,” said Mark Davis, a professor at Stanford’s School of Medicine, who will lead the new center. . “This will require a better understanding of the human immune response and clearer predictions about vaccine efficacy for particular diseases,” he said in the statement. . The Seattle-based Gates Foundation’s grant comes as an outbreak of measles has infected more than 90 people in California and elsewhere, with most cases linked to an outbreak that public health officials suspect began when an infected person visited Disneyland. . Public health officials have urged parents to vaccinate their children against the highly contagious disease. . The outbreak also renewed focus on the anti-vaccination movement which fears potential side effects of immunizations. . The Gates Foundation was set up by Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, and wife Melinda to fight disease and poverty around the world. |Fri Jan 30 20:08:32 +0000 2015||Gates Foundation awards $50 million to Stanford vaccine discovery |5.6125465513375744e+17|http://reut.rs/1EUzIlQ
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India’s Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has won U.S. approval to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd on condition that it sell its interest in a generic antibacterial medicine, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Friday. . Sun Pharmaceutical said in April that it had agreed to buy the Indian generic drugmaker from its current owner, Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo Co, for $3.2 billion. . Ranbaxy has been involved in a wrangle with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has barred a range of its medicines from the United States after finding that some of the company’s plants did not meet U.S. standards. . The FTC, whose job is to ensure that anti-monopoly laws are enforced, did not weigh in on the safety issue but said it would allow the transaction if Ranbaxy sold its interests in generic minocycline tablets and capsules to generic maker Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd, which is also based in India. . The medicine is commonly used to treat pneumonia, urinary tract infections and acne. . Ranbaxy is one of three companies to sell the antibacterial drug, and Sun is expected to begin selling the medicines soon, the FTC said in a statement. |Fri Jan 30 19:52:42 +0000 2015||Sun Pharmaceutical wins U.S. approval to buy Ranbaxy |5.61250670775636e+17|http://reut.rs/1EUxtPt

Daniel Flynn|DAKAR (Reuters) - African countries want to extend a new catastrophe insurance fund, which made its first payout of $25 million this month, to include protection against epidemics in the wake of the devastating Ebola outbreak. . The African Risk Capacity (ARC) agency, a specialized body of the African Union, launched a scheme last year to insure against natural disasters. It is an effort to break Africa’s reliance on foreign aid and address the impact of climate change by using innovative financial techniques. . The ARC paid $25 million in its first year of operations to Senegal, Mauritania and Niger to mitigate the effects of a severe drought in the arid Sahel region south of the Sahara — well above the $8 million in premiums paid by those countries. . The other African nation to take out a policy, Kenya, paid $9 million but received no insurance payment. . Richard Wilcox, the ARC’s director general, said that its success so far had encouraged 12 countries to sign up for policies for the second year.  . African states, he said, have also approached ARC to develop insurance against epidemics after the Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 8,800 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — severely damaging their economies. . “The scale of the Ebola crisis in those three countries was a wake-up call to everybody,” Wilcox said, and his agency was working with virologists and other experts to design a system of coverage.  . “Technically, this is much harder than the weather risk because with weather we have 30 years of reliable data. Disease outbreaks are much rarer.” . The World Bank estimates the three countries hardest-hit by Ebola will lose $1.6 billion in economic output this year. Mining companies have suspended expansion plans, agricultural production has slumped and tourists have avoided the region. . ARC was capitalized using $200 million from the British and German development institutions. That money will be paid back without interest in 20 years time, allowing the ARC to offer below-market premiums to African states. . By pooling disaster risks across east and west Africa, which have uncorrelated rainfall patterns, the ARC is also able to undercut commercial insurers. On top of drought coverage, the fund will offer cyclone and flood insurance next year. . By making use of reinsurance, ARC was only liable for the first $15 million in payments this year — meaning that it received $2 million more in premiums than it paid out.

The Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA), a private, for-profit operator of cancer treatment hospitals and outpatient clinics, will treat NFL Alumni who are fighting prostate cancer, which afflicts almost one in seven U.S. men, at its five hospitals in Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Tulsa. . “CTCA is proud to partner with NFLA and we look forward to making a difference in the lives of those alums who are or will be diagnosed with prostate cancer,” Gerard van Grinsven, chief executive and president of CTCA, said in a statement Thursday. . Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men in the United States, second only to non-melanoma skin cancer. It also is the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men. . “This new partnership addresses one of the biggest health concerns among men today,” said NFL Alumni head Joe Pisarcik.  . The CTCA is already sponsoring sunblock dispensers for fans at pre-game events in downtown Phoenix ahead of the game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots.  . The NFL Alumni Association is a group of former league players, coaches and other employees who help ex-players and their families with medical, financial and social programs. |Fri Jan 30 16:59:45 +0000 2015||Cancer organization partners with NFL on prostate treatment |5.612071496707113e+17|http://reut.rs/1EUa8xr
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday proposed a plan to move most doctors, hospitals and their patients to national standards for handling electronic clinical data by the end of 2017. . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as part of an effort to propel the $2.9 trillion U.S. healthcare system away from a costly fee-for-service system, released a report draft aimed at establishing an inter operable health information technology system that can be accessed by patients and their healthcare providers.   . Policy experts say that national health IT standards would lead to transparency in medical data, prices and provider performance, while helping support hospitals and medical practices in pursuing care-delivery models that emphasize care quality and savings over quantity. . Earlier this week, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced the goal of moving 50 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments to quality-care focused providers by the end of 2018. . An industry task force has also been formed to facilitate a similar transformation for the private healthcare sector. . HHS said the new IT roadmap “focuses on actions that will enable a majority of individuals and providers across the care continuum to send, receive, find and use a common set of electronic clinical information at the nationwide level by the end of 2017.” . The release was warmly received by consumer advocates who support the administration’s care-delivery goals.  . “We are especially pleased that the new roadmap focuses on interoperability not just among providers, but also patients and their family caregivers, recognizing them as equal partners in the continuum of care,” Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, said in a statement.     . The document covers core technical standards and functions, certification, privacy, security and governance. Public comment period on the draft closes April 3. . HHS released a separate advisory listing available standards and implementation specifications. Public comment on the standards advisory closes May 1.  |Fri Jan 30 16:43:57 +0000 2015||U.S. government releases draft plan for electronic health data |5.612031706057933e+17|http://reut.rs/1A74x7S
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pomegranate juice maker POM Wonderful cannot advertise that its pomegranate drinks treat or prevent heart disease or other ailments unless it has proof, a U.S. appeals court said Friday, upholding an order by the Federal Trade Commission. . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld a 2010 order by the Federal Trade Commission, which found that POM Wonderful’s advertising was misleading in claiming its products would treat or reduce the risk of diseases ranging from heart disease to prostate cancer to erectile dysfunction. . The advertisements that the FTC challenged appeared in Parade, Fitness and Prevention magazines, as well as online, and on product tags, the FTC said.  . “Many of those ads mischaracterized the scientific evidence concerning the health benefits of POM’s products with regard to those diseases. The FTC Act proscribes — and the First Amendment does not protect — deceptive and misleading advertisements,” the court said in its ruling. . But the appeals court said the FTC went too far in requiring two human clinical trial studies to support any health claims in advertising, saying there was “inadequate justification” for that demand. . POM said it was pleased with this portion of the decision.  . “We are grateful that the court substantially reduced the requirement that the FTC tried to enforce on us to conduct multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled studies,” the company said in a statement.   . The FTC said the decision was a victory for consumers. . “It is in keeping with established law that advertisers who market products for serious health conditions must have rigorous science to back up those claims,” wrote FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in a statement. “The court specifically recognized that this applies to food and dietary supplement marketers such as POM.” . The advertisements that most concerned the FTC were discontinued in 2005 and others were halted in 2007, said lawyer Thomas Goldstein when he argued for POM Wonderful before the judges in May 2014. . The case is in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. It is POM Wonderful, LLC v. Federal Trade Commission and is No. 13-1060. |Fri Jan 30 16:07:47 +0000 2015||POM Wonderful ads deceptive and not protected: appeals court |5.6119407167143936e+17|http://reut.rs/1EU2wuO

|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia said on Friday it would delay reopening schools for two weeks in order to better prepare safety measures against the Ebola virus, which has killed more than 3,650 people in the country but now appears to be receding. . Liberian schools, shut since August due to the outbreak, had initially been scheduled to reopen on Feb. 2, but the education ministry said it had pushed back that date to allow parents and students more time to prepare. . A ministry statement said it wanted to “raise awareness about safety protocols, logistics and training requirements”, adding: “Actual teaching will begin on Monday, Feb. 16, 2015.” . Some Liberian opposition parties and members of parliament had called for the reopening date to be moved to March 2, concerned that the Ebola epidemic is not yet fully under control. . Liberia and its neighbors Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hardest hit in the worst outbreak of the viral hemorrhagic fever on record. . The epidemic has killed 8,810 people in total out of 22,092 cases, mostly in the three countries, since it was first identified early last year. . The number of Ebola infections and deaths has fallen sharply in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the past few weeks, with just 20 deaths recorded in Liberia in the 21 days to Jan. 25, according to the World Health Organization, raising hopes that the disease is gradually being brought under control. . Guinea reopened schools earlier this month, while Sierra Leone plans to reopen its schools in March. |Fri Jan 30 15:24:57 +0000 2015||Liberia delays school reopening by two weeks as Ebola cases fall |5.611832891099095e+17|http://reut.rs/1A6JfYe
Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - West Africa will be lucky to wipe out Ebola this year, as the local population remains suspicious of aid workers, especially in Guinea, the Red Cross said on Friday. . The virus is “flaring up” in new areas in the region and not all infections are being reported, said Birte Hald, who leads the Ebola coordination and support unit of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. . “We are also seeing that in places like Sierra Leone and especially in Guinea that it is flaring up in new districts all the time, with small new chains of transmission, which means that it’s not under control and it could flare up big-time again,” Hald told a news briefing in Geneva. . “I think that we should consider ourselves lucky and fortunate if we are able to stop it in 2015,” she said. . More than 6,000 Red Cross volunteers are deployed in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, tracing contacts of those infected, isolating suspect cases and ensuring safe burials, she said. . But the Red Cross still has “no access” to some communities in Guinea, Hald said. It saw “quite a number of incidents” of backlash in January. . “There are still communities that think, for instance, Ebola is spreading with spraying chlorine, disinfecting of the houses, and it is the Red Cross team that are coming with the chlorine, so they are making that connection,” she said. . To de-escalate tensions, the Red Cross is sending police and authorities a day in advance to prepare villages for the arrival of its teams, she said. . “If we don’t get full access in Guinea, then we definitely risk that this will become something permanent. If it’s permanent in Guinea, then we know also that it will be in the whole region, because there are porous borders,” Hald said. . The number of new confirmed Ebola cases totaled 99 in the week to Jan. 25, the lowest tally since June, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, signaling the tide might have turned against the epidemic.. The outbreak has killed 8,810 people out of 22,092 known cases. . Some 27 sub-prefectures in Guinea reported at least one security incident or other form of refusal to cooperate in the week to Jan 21. Two districts in Liberia and four in Sierra Leone reported at least one similar incident, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said on Friday. . The decline in new cases should not lead to complacency, she said: “Because one unsafe burial - only one - can really create a new chain of transmission and cause other cases of Ebola.” |Fri Jan 30 14:28:28 +0000 2015||Ebola likely to persist in 2015 as communities resist aid: Red Cross |5.611690768408494e+17|http://reut.rs/1ETOHfR
Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has proposed analyzing genetic information from more than 1 million American volunteers as part of a new initiative to understand human disease and develop medicines targeted to an individual’s genetic make-up. . At the heart of the “precision medicine” initiative, announced on Friday by President Barack Obama, is the creation of a pool of people - healthy and ill, men and women, old and young - who would be studied to learn how genetic variants affect health and disease. . Officials hope genetic data from several hundred thousand participants in ongoing genetic studies would be used and other volunteers recruited to reach the 1 million total. . “Precision medicine gives us one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs we’ve ever seen,” Obama said, promising that it would “lay a foundation for a new era of life-saving discoveries.”  . The near-term goal is to create more and better treatments for cancer, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. Longer term, he said, the project would provide information on how to individualize treatment for a range of diseases. . The initial focus on cancer, he said, reflects the lethality of the disease and the significant advances against cancer that precision medicine has already made, though more work is needed. . The president proposed $215 million in his 2016 budget for the initiative. Of that, $130 million would go to the NIH to fund the research cohort and $70 million to NIH’s National Cancer Institute to intensify efforts to identify molecular drivers of cancer and apply that knowledge to drug development. . A further $10 million would go to the Food and Drug Administration to develop databases on which to build an appropriate regulatory structure; $5 million would go to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to develop privacy standards and ensure the secure exchange of data. . The effort may raise alarm bells for privacy rights advocates who have questioned the government’s ability to guarantee that DNA information is kept anonymous. . Obama promised that “privacy will be built in from day one.”  . The funding is not nearly enough to sequence 1 million genomes from scratch. Whole-genome sequencing, though plummeting in price, still costs about $1,000 per genome, Collins said, meaning this component alone would cost $1 billion. . Instead, he said, the national cohort would be assembled both from new volunteers interested in “an opportunity to take part in something historic,” and existing cohorts that are already linking genomic data to medical outcomes. . The most ambitious of these is the Million Veteran Program, launched in 2011 by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Aimed at making genomic discoveries and bringing personalized medicine to veterans, it has enrolled more than 300,000 veterans and determined DNA sequences of about 200,000. . The VA was a pioneer in electronic health records, which it will use to link the genotypes to vets’ medical histories. . Academic centers have, with NIH funding, also amassed thousands of genomes and linked them to the risk of disease and other health outcomes. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network, announced by NIH in 2007, aims to combine DNA information on more than 300,000 people and look for connections to diseases as varied as autism, appendicitis, cataracts, diabetes and dementia. . In 2014, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc launched a collaboration with Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health System to sequence the DNA of 100,000 Geisinger patients and, using their anonymous medical records, look for correlations between genes and disease. The company is sequencing 50,000 samples per year, spokeswoman Hala Mirza said. . Perhaps the most audacious effort is by the non-profit Human Longevity Inc, headed by Craig Venter. In 2013 it launched a project to sequence 1 million genomes by 2020. Privately funded, it will be made available to pharmaceutical companies such as Roche Holding AG. . “We’re happy to work with them to help move the science,” Venter said in an interview, referring to the administration’s initiative. . But because of regulations surrounding medical privacy, he said, “we can’t just mingle databases. It sounds like a naive assumption” if the White House expects existing cohorts to merge into its 1 million-genomes project. . Venter raced the government-funded Human Genome Project to a draw in 2000, sequencing the entire human genome using private funding in less time than it took the public effort.       . Collins conceded that mingling the databases would be a challenge but insisted it is doable. . “It is something that can be achieved but obviously there is a lot that needs to be done,” he said. . Collating, analyzing and applying the data to develop drugs will require changes to how products are reviewed and approved by health regulators. . Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the FDA’s commissioner, said precision medicine “presents a set of new issues for us at FDA.” The agency is discussing new ways to approach the review process for personalized medicines and tests, she added. |Fri Jan 30 12:15:41 +0000 2015||U.S. proposes effort to analyze DNA from 1 million people |5.61135661231915e+17|http://reut.rs/1A65tcU
Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A patient suspected of contracting Ebola after traveling in West Africa and exhibiting symptoms of the disease was admitted on Thursday to a special isolation hospital unit in Sacramento and was being tested for infection, officials said. . The patient was considered at a relatively low risk of infection. Although recently in an area where Ebola transmission is widespread, the person had no known contact with anyone who has had the disease, said Laura McCasland, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento County Public Health Department. . McCasland said she did not know precisely where or when the patient had traveled in West Africa, the epicenter of the worst Ebola epidemic on record, or why the individual was there or for how long. . The patient was transferred on Thursday morning to the University of California-Davis Medical Center from Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, and was later listed in good condition, the medical center said in statements. . The hospital said the patient was admitted after exhibiting “symptoms consistent with Ebola infection,” but did not elaborate.  . Hospital spokeswoman Dorsey Griffith said the patient was being tested for infection. . She declined to specify the symptoms exhibited but said they were serious enough “that the patient was admitted as a suspected Ebola patient.” The individual was being treated in a special Ebola isolation unit at the hospital, she said. . State epidemiologist Dr. Gil Chavez said in a separate statement that an Ebola diagnosis had not been confirmed. . “Whenever there is a person displaying symptoms that may be Ebola, who has recently traveled to Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea, certain precautions are taken, including isolating the patient, ruling out other infectious diseases and testing for Ebola if warranted,” he said.  . The patient was transferred to UC Davis Medical Center because that facility had been designated as a “priority hospital” for evaluating and treating potential Ebola patients, the hospital said. The medical center remained open and was operating as normal, it said. . At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States, four of whom were diagnosed with the deadly disease on U.S. soil, during a West African epidemic that has taken at least 8,800 lives, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. . Only two people are known to have contracted the virus in the United States - two nurses who treated an Ebola patient from Liberia who became sick while visiting in Dallas. That man, Thomas Duncan, later died. . Dozens of others tested for Ebola in the United States after showing possible signs of the disease or thought to have been exposed to the virus have turned out not to have been infected. |Fri Jan 30 01:36:34 +0000 2015||Suspected Ebola patient admitted to California hospital |5.609748233259909e+17|http://reut.rs/1A4vitV
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans on Thursday to get vaccinated for measles amid an outbreak that began at Disneyland in December, saying that 2014 saw the highest number of cases in two decades. . So far more than 90 people have been diagnosed with measles in California and elsewhere, most of them linked to an outbreak that public health officials suspect began when an infected person from outside the United States visited Disneyland in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20. . On Wednesday, a high school in Palm Desert, California, barred dozens of non-vaccinated students from school over concerns that a classmate may have contracted the highly contagious disease. . Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 but Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the disease could still easily be brought in by a traveler from abroad. . “This is a wake-up call to make sure we keep measles from getting a foothold in our country,” she said. . The outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated. . Schuchat called it “frustrating” that some Americans had opted out of the vaccine for non-medical reasons, saying it was crucial that they be given good information about the safety and reliability of inoculations. . Asked by reporters if health officials were worried about the possibility that the outbreak could be further spread at the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Schuchat said only that people everywhere should be on their guard but declined to identify the football game on Sunday as an area of special concern. . “I wouldn’t expect the Super Bowl to be a place where many unvaccinated people will be congregating,” she said. . Homegrown measles, whose symptoms include rash and fever, was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But health officials say cases imported by travelers from overseas continue to infect unvaccinated U.S. residents. . The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Fri Jan 30 00:49:19 +0000 2015||CDC urges measles vaccinations amid Disneyland outbreak |5.609629293284229e+17|http://reut.rs/1A4nLel
Kate Kelland|LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A major analysis of one of the world’s most fiercely disputed medicines, Roche’s Tamiflu, has found it cuts flu symptoms by a day and can help some patients avoid hospital treatment and complications. . But the drug can also have side effects, including nausea and vomiting, which should be balanced against its benefits, researchers who led the study said. . Published in The Lancet on Friday, the pooled analysis included data from all previously published and unpublished trials of Tamiflu, which has been the subject of intense scientific debate for years. . The drug, known generically as oseltamivir, is an anti-viral which was stockpiled and widely used by governments during the 2009/2010 H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic. It is approved by regulators worldwide and is on the World Health Organization’s “essential medicines” list. . A high-profile analysis led by the Cochrane review  concluded last year that Tamiflu’s benefits were slim and were outweighed by adverse side effects. Researchers who led that study accused governments of throwing money “down the drain” by buying the drug for stockpiles.     . The Lancet study, led by Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and Stuart Pocock of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, analysed data from nine trials comparing Tamiflu with placebo for 4,328 adults with laboratory-confirmed seasonal flu. . They found it reduced the duration of symptoms by 21 percent compared with placebo, from 123 to 98 hours, and significantly cut the risk of hospitalisations and flu complications such as pneumonia. . “The safety and effectiveness of oseltamivir has been hotly debated, with some researchers claiming there is little evidence that (it) works,” Monto said in a comment about the findings. . He said this analysis found “compelling evidence” of Tamiflu’s benefits, adding: “Whether the magnitude of these benefits outweigh the harms of nausea and vomiting needs careful consideration.”    . Peter Openshaw, a respiratory infections expert at Imperial College London who was not involved in either analysis, said they showed Tamiflu “is not a perfect drug but does what you might expect of an antiviral given relatively late in the course of an acute infection”. . Annual sales of Tamiflu, which Roche has always defended as effective, hit almost $3 billion in 2009, mainly due to use during the pandemic. They have since declined, although a bad flu season in the United States pushed sales up in the last quarter of 2014 |Fri Jan 30 00:33:25 +0000 2015||Study supports Roche's disputed blockbuster flu drug Tamiflu |5.609589303405527e+17|http://reut.rs/1ESC6tA
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved two fixed-dose HIV pills that combine protease inhibitors - one made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and the other by Johnson & Johnson - both with a boosting agent produced by Gilead Sciences Inc. . Bristol-Myers said its drug, Evotaz, is a once-daily pill containing Reyataz, also known as atazanavir, a protease inhibitor, with the booster cobicistat.  . J&J’s once-daily Prezcobix, combines protease inhibitor darunavir, or Prezista, with cobicistat. . The FDA approved both drugs for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. . Because patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, which can cause AIDS, may over time become resistant to treatments, there is a need for a broad range of antiretroviral therapies. |Thu Jan 29 22:56:55 +0000 2015||FDA approves Bristol-Myers' HIV drug |5.609346439194911e+17|http://reut.rs/1A44xph
Emma Batha|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Supermodel turned campaigner against female genital mutilation Waris Dirie said on Thursday she was optimistic that FGM could be eradicated in her lifetime, branding the tradition “a cruel and perfidious war on little girls.” . “FGM breaches all human rights and has no place in any 21st century society,” said Dirie, who underwent FGM in Somalia when she was 5 years old and whose sister bled to death after being cut. . An estimated 140 million women and girls worldwide have undergone FGM which involves the partial or total removal of the external genitalia. In its most extreme form the vaginal opening is also sewn closed. . Dirie said her Desert Flower Foundation aimed to save 1 million girls across Africa from the “barbaric” ritual in the next few years through a sponsorship project which provides food, kerosene and school fees to families who pledge not to cut their daughters. . The former model sponsors the family of the girl from Djibouti who played the young Dirie in the 2009 film based on her best-selling autobiography “Desert Flower.” . Speaking after receiving a human rights award at the House of Lords in London, Dirie welcomed the growing global momentum to stamp out FGM, a procedure which can cause lifelong physical and psychological problems. . “Twenty years ago when I started to speak, there was silence. There was nobody doing or saying (anything).  I just thought . . . I had nothing to lose. . “I got a lot of threats. I was pushed to the side. It was very hard. But now so many people are fighting this that my time wasn’t wasted,” she said.  . Dirie fled Somalia when she was 13, after being forced to marry a man old enough to be her grandfather. . She ended up in Britain where she catapulted to fame after being discovered by a top fashion photographer. . Dirie said the modeling world had turned against her when she started speaking out about FGM in the early 1990s. But she said she did not care as modeling was never a vocation. . She said her dream now was to see FGM end in her lifetime. “I’m very much optimistic (we can end it). If we all come together then we can and we will and we should,” she added. . British government minister Lynne Featherstone, who presented Dirie with the Liberal International Prize for Freedom - an annual award made by the international federation for liberal political parties - said she hoped FGM would become as outdated as foot-binding. . “I want to praise Waris and all those brave survivors who have spoken out and broken the silence. Together we will get there, we will end FGM in our lifetime,” said Featherstone, who has spearheaded British efforts to end FGM.  . FGM is practiced by communities across a swathe of African countries as well as pockets of Asia and the Middle East. . Families see FGM as a way of preserving a girl’s purity and a gateway to marriage. In many communities uncut girls are ostracized. . Dirie admitted it was very hard to persuade a family who thought they were acting in their daughter’s best interests that FGM was wrong. . But she revealed she had finally changed her mother’s mind. “If I can persuade my mother I can convince anyone!” she said.|Thu Jan 29 22:00:22 +0000 2015||Ex-supermodel Waris Dirie says FGM can end in her lifetime |5.609204136442593e+17|http://reut.rs/1ESouyo
Will Dunham|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American scientists and the general public hold vastly different views on key scientific issues including the role of people in causing climate change, the safety of genetically modified food, and evolution, a poll released on Thursday showed. . Eighty-seven percent of scientists questioned by the Pew Research Center said human activity was the main cause of global climate change, compared with 50 percent of the public. . Twenty-five percent of the public said there was no solid evidence the climate was warming, up from 11 percent in a similar 2009 survey. . The issue has become increasing divisive, with some leading conservatives expressing doubt that human activity like the burning of fossils fuels that release greenhouse gases is driving a global warming trend. . Scientists from two U.S. government agencies said this month that 2014 was the hottest year on record and blamed human activities for Earth’s warming trend. . There was an even bigger chasm over genetically modified foods, with 88 percent of the scientists saying they were safe to eat, compared with 37 percent of the public. . On evolution, 98 percent of scientists said humans had evolved over time, compared with 65 percent of the public. . The findings were based on responses last August from 2,002 U.S. adults nationwide, with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. . The results were compared with answers last September and October from 3,748 scientists who are members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a leading scientific organization that also publishes the journal Science. The research was conducted in collaboration with the association. . Alan Leshner, the association’s chief executive, told reporters that “science is being trumped” by factors including political views on climate change, religious beliefs on evolution and lack of scientific understanding about genetically modified foods. . “Speaking up for the importance of science to society is our only hope, and scientists must not shy away from engaging with the public, even on the most polarizing science-based topics,” Leshner wrote in an editorial in Science. . Other areas with opinion gaps included: . - whether childhood vaccines such as those for measles, mumps and rubella should be mandatory (86 percent of the scientists said yes, compared with 68 percent of the public). . - using animals in biomedical research (89 percent of scientists favored it, compared with 47 percent of the public); . - the safety of eating foods grown with pesticides (68 percent of scientists said it was safe, compared with 28 percent of the public). |Thu Jan 29 22:00:22 +0000 2015||Poll finds gaping chasm in views between U.S. public, scientists |5.609204118449111e+17|http://reut.rs/1A3SCI7
Mary Wisniewski|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Advocates for medical marijuana in Illinois are concerned that delays in issuing distribution licenses, exacerbated by a change in governors, is keeping the drug from patients who need it. . Former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, who supported medical marijuana, left office in January without issuing licenses for growth and distribution, leaving it to his successor, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. . Rauner, who has expressed skepticism about the licensing process, wants a thorough legal review, his office said, which means more time before the 2013 law can be implemented. . For patients that means no hope of getting the drug until at least June even if the Rauner administration issues licenses in the next month, said Chris Lindsey, legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit. . The law requires plants to be grown in Illinois, which takes  4-1/2 months in the best of circumstances.  . “We’re pretty concerned - we’ve been waiting for a long time,” Lindsey said. Supporters had hoped licenses would be issued last fall. . Illinois is one of 23 states plus the District of Columbia that permits medical marijuana. Illinois’ trial program expires in 2017. . Lindsey said he believes Rauner is “trying to be careful, but in the process he’s really failing our seriously ill patients in Illinois.” . The Quinn administration prepared lists of businesses qualified to receive the licenses before he left office, according to recently released documents. . A Quinn administration spokesperson said that while state agencies made substantial progress evaluating applicants, Quinn decided to turn the job over to Rauner for proper review. . Rauner’s office said it will refer its findings to the state Attorney General’s office. . Democratic State Representative Lou Lang, a medical marijuana supporter, said Quinn’s staff used blind scoring procedures to eliminate favoritism in picking who should get licenses, and it was a shame Quinn didn’t issue them. . “Now we have a governor who’s not a big fan of the program and has to be convinced to move forward,” Lang said. .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – Up to 17 percent of young adults in the U.S. may be using “withdrawal” to prevent pregnancy, although not necessarily relying just on that method, a new study finds. . In the sample population of 15-24 year olds, men and women who feared condoms would interfere with pleasure and women who said they would be “pleased” by an unplanned pregnancy were two to four times more likely than others to have used withdrawal. . “The condom and pleasure variable didn’t surprise me, it’s intuitive, it makes sense, but I think the strength of its association surprised me,” said study coauthor Jenny Higgins, a public health researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. . She added that scientists don’t often ask about pleasure in research on contraception and condoms but when they do, they learn a lot more about who is using certain methods and why. . Withdrawal or “pulling out” is not considered to be an effective form of birth control on its own and is not recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a contraceptive method, although Planned Parenthood says it can work effectively up to 96 percent of the time if done correctly every time. . “I think that withdrawal as a method is much less effective than many great methods, like IUDs for example, so I would never recommend that young persons only use withdrawal,” Higgins said. . But withdrawal could be a great option as a backup or additional method, she said, and that’s how many of the young adults in the study reported using it. . For their study, published in the journal Contraception, Higgins and her coauthor used national survey data for 2006-2010. They analyzed responses from a total of 1,607 young men and 1,849 young women, most in their 20s, who were sexually active, not pregnant or trying to get pregnant, and not infertile or sterile. . Participants were asked what types of contraceptives they had used the last time they had sex before the survey. About 14 percent of participants said they’d used withdrawal with additional contraceptive methods, and 7 percent said they only used withdrawal.  . About 70 percent of the women and almost 60 percent of men said they would be upset if the woman got pregnant. But among those women who said they’d be pleased by a pregnancy, 13 percent used withdrawal, compared to 6 percent of women who would not be pleased. . Just over 60 percent of women said using a condom wouldn’t reduce their physical pleasure while just over 30 percent of men said the same.  . For both women and men, those who felt that condoms were likely to diminish sexual pleasure were more than twice as likely to have used withdrawal with or without other methods.  . Among men and women who used withdrawal, the majority did so in conjunction with other methods, sometimes up to a total of three, the researchers note.  . About 65 percent of men and women reported use of withdrawal along with an IUD or hormonal contraceptive such as birth control pills or implants. Less than a third used just a condom plus withdrawal or withdrawal alone. . The study team also analyzed socioeconomic factors, including age, race, religion, personal and family education levels, health insurance status and receipt of public assistance. None of these correlated with the likelihood of using the withdrawal method. . Richard de Visser, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex in the UK, said these findings are somewhat disappointing because they suggest that many young people are not acting to protect themselves properly against the risk of unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.  . “It is perhaps not surprising that people who were less concerned about unplanned pregnancy were more likely to report use of withdrawal,” de Visser told Reuters Health by email. . De Visser, who was not involved in the study, said “many people have negative attitudes toward condoms - some will not use them at all, opting instead for less reliable methods such as withdrawal.” . These findings suggest that many people have misperceptions about the efficacy of withdrawal that should be addressed, he added.  . “In addition to looking at withdrawal we also need to do more to encourage correct use of condoms - that means putting them on before any genital contact and not removing them early - and to improve attitudes toward condom use,” he said. . Higgins, pointing to the majority of withdrawal users who used an additional method, cautioned, “we need to be careful before we malign withdrawal users – these could be extremely motivated young people who are doing this on top of other things.” . Younger adults use condoms more frequently than any other age group, Higgins added. “I feel like there’s this tendency to say that young people are really bad about this stuff, but they can be better than most older adults,” she said. “I feel they are doing things in some ways better than we’re giving them credit for.”  .

Ransdell Pierson|(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories’ chief executive officer is not worried about the stronger dollar, telling analysts on Thursday his company will better withstand its painful effects than rivals due to its European factories and growing sales of nutritional products, medical diagnostics and medical optics. . “We are just not vulnerable to the euro and a lot of companies are,” Miles White told analysts on a conference call. . White said the stronger dollar will crimp company sales by 6 percent this year, far worse than the 2.5 percent drag on Abbott sales seen in 2014. . But the potential foreign exchange hit is limited, Abbott said, because many of Abbott’s factories are located in Europe, where they incur costs in euros. Moreover, the European factories ship diagnostics and other medical devices, generic drugs, infant and adult nutritional products and other products around the world, limiting exposure to the dollar. . Abbott, which captures 70 percent of its revenue from outside the United States, on Thursday said its global sales rose 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter. But it said sales would have risen 10.2 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowered the value of sales in many other countries whose currencies have weakened versus the dollar. . Abbott has annual sales of more than $20 billion. Half of its sales are in emerging markets, like China and India, while 30 percent are from the United States and another 20 percent is from other developed countries, including Europe and Canada.  . Rival U.S. healthcare companies Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in the past week issued 2015 earnings forecasts below Wall Street expectations, citing the stronger dollar. . But Abbott’s 2015 earnings outlook of $2.10 to $2.20 per share from continuing operations was in line with expectations, and would reflect growth of 8.5 percent from last year. . While other companies lowered their 2015 forecasts due to currency factors, White said Abbott refused “to reset the bar lower,” and might well end up topping its 2015 profit forecast. . “We are entering 2015 with good momentum,” White told analysts. “The fundamentals of our business are strong and ongoing trends across our markets remain positive.” . The suburban Chicago company, whose profit margins rose by two percentage points last year, said they are expected to expand by another percentage point in 2015, on cost cuts and stronger sales of its array of products. . Abbott shares rose 3.3 percent on Thursday to $44.84, outpacing a 0.7 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.  |Thu Jan 29 20:35:11 +0000 2015||Abbott CEO losing no sleep over stronger dollar |5.608989744551977e+17|http://reut.rs/1ESfvx1
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - In the U.S., less than a third of older heart “event” patients being discharged from the hospital get the recommended high-intensity statins, according to a new study that looked at prescriptions filled. . National guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association say the majority of patients should be on a high-dose statin following a serious heart disease-related event like heart attack or bypass surgery.  . “It appears that there’s tremendous reticence in prescription of statin therapy,” said lead author Dr. Robert S. Rosenson of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. . “Whatever the dose of statin people were taking when they came to the hospital was the dose they went out on, the acute event didn’t change it,” he told Reuters Health. “This is very disappointing.” . The authors studied a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 to 74 who filled a statin prescription after having a heart attack or bypass surgery between 2007 and 2009. . Of more than 8,000 people who filled a statin prescription after one of these events, only 27 percent of the first post-discharge prescriptions were for “high-intensity” statins, such as 40 to 80 milligrams of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or 80 milligrams of simvastatin (Zocor).  . Less than 25 percent of people who were not taking a statin before their hospitalization filled a high-intensity statin prescription on their release, and less than 10 percent of those who had been taking a low-intensity statin switched to a high-intensity one. . About 80 percent of people who had already been taking high-intensity statins filled another such prescription immediately upon leaving the hospital, according to the results in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. . Of the patients whose first post-discharge prescription fill was for a low-intensity statin, less than 12 percent switched to a high-intensity dosage within the following year. . “There’s a tremendous amount of confusion,” Rosenson said. Though the clinical guidelines, which are supported by rigorous studies and high quality results, indicate that high dose statins are better than low dose statins after an acute cardiac event, many doctors appear not to be following them. . High intensity statins have been linked to better health outcomes in the short and long term for these patients, he said. . “It could be that either the doctors are not aware of the guidelines that high intensity therapy is proven to be better, or more likely they are focusing on the (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol level,” he said. . There has been confusion on whether or not to dose statins based on LDL cholesterol readings for some patients, but for those who have suffered an acute cardiac event, a high dose is better, he said. . “If statins are fairly safe and highly effective agents particularly for these types of patients, yet only about 50 to 60 percent of these patients are on what has been recommended and proved, why is that?” asked Dr. Prakash Deedwania of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine in Fresno who wrote an editorial accompanying the new results.  . Side effects from statins are rare, he noted, and cost of the drugs -  which are mostly generic, inexpensive, and covered by insurance including Medicare - should not be an issue. There is some risk of developing what is know as “chemical diabetes,” but the benefits of the drugs far outweigh this risk, Deedwania told Reuters Health.  . “The benefit is 10-fold greater than any sort of harm,” he said. . When doctors know that an oversight body is going to be looking at their prescribing data, they are more likely to follow guidelines, he said. . “We should be doing this without anyone looking, but unfortunately it doesn’t work like that,” Deedwania said. . Though the authors focus on doctors likely not prescribing the recommended statin dose, there could be confusion or reluctance on the patient side as well, he said. . Much like blood pressure medication, statins don’t provide immediate symptom relief while they are acting in the body. Since patients don’t feel a difference when they take the medication, they may not be motivated to continue taking it, he said. . “The burden is on us to educate our patients, tell them precisely in simple terms what are the benefits of statins,” Deedwania said. . In addition to reducing the risk of another heart attack and making a bypass graft more durable over time, statins reduce the risk of stroke, he said. . “That resonates really well,” Deedwania said. “Everybody wants to get extra benefits,” .

Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A patient suspected of being infected with Ebola was admitted on Thursday to a special isolation unit of a University of California hospital in Sacramento and was being tested for infection, hospital and public health officials said. . The patient was transferred on Thursday morning to UC Davis Medical Center from Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, the state capital, with “symptoms consistent with Ebola infection,” the medical center said in a statement. . The statement gave no further information about the case. . Sacramento County Public Health Department spokeswoman Laura McCasland was quoted as telling the Sacramento Bee newspaper: “The patient is considered low-risk and more information is being gathered.” . Hospital spokeswoman Dorsey Griffith said the patient was being tested but she did not know whether the individual had traveled recently in West Africa, the epicenter of the worst Ebola epidemic on record. . Griffith declined to specify the symptoms exhibited by the person but said they were serious enough “that the patient was admitted as a suspected Ebola patient.” The individual was being treated in a special Ebola isolation unit set up at the hospital, she said. . Dr. Gil Chavez, state epidemiologist for the California Department of Public Health, suggested the patient in question may have been in West Africa’s Ebola zone. . “Whenever there is a person displaying symptoms that may be Ebola, who has recently traveled to Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea, certain precautions are taken, including isolating the patient, ruling out other infectious diseases and testing for Ebola if warranted,” he said. . UC Davis Medical Center has been designated by state health officials as a priority hospital equipped to handle confirmed Ebola patients. The medical center remained open and was operating as normal, the hospital said. . At least 10 people are known to have been treated for Ebola in the United States, four of whom were diagnosed with the deadly disease on U.S. soil, during an epidemic that has taken at least 8,800 lives, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. . Only two people are known to have contracted the virus in the United States - two nurses who treated an Ebola patient from Liberia who became sick while visiting in Dallas. That man, Thomas Duncan, later died. . Dozens of others tested for Ebola in the United States after showing possible signs of the disease or thought to have been exposed to the virus have turned out not to have been infected. |Thu Jan 29 19:56:50 +0000 2015||Suspected Ebola patient admitted to California hospital |5.6088932550496256e+17|http://reut.rs/1ESbOaT

Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) – When Sigrid Fry-Revere decided to donate a kidney to a friend in 2010, she thought she knew what to expect. . She was medically compatible and insured. She planned surgery during the Christmas holidays, so her husband and college-aged sons could take time off to help her recover at their 10-acre Virginia farm. . What she didn’t consider was the factor that ultimately disqualified her: personal expenses. . The transplant team required an eight-week recovery plan. Her caregivers, however, could only be home for a month, so she would need to hire a farmhand. With this unanticipated and unaffordable expense, she was quickly eliminated. . “I was dumbfounded,” Fry-Revere said. “They would rather let him die than give me time to figure out how to take care of myself.” . According to the American Journal of Nephrology, living donors incur out-of-pocket expenses averaging $5,000, and sometimes up to four times that amount. . Fry-Revere’s friend did die. Last fall, she established the non-profit American Living Organ Donor Fund to help donors cover lost wages and donor-related costs. With donations from an online Kickstarter campaign, the fund has granted three requests so far. Three others are under review.  . According to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, more than 123,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplants. Roughly 102,000 need kidneys and more than 15,000 need livers – and many of them could be helped by living donors.  . But a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that half of Americans would struggle to come up with $2,000 in a pinch, let alone the much higher amounts donors generally need.  . The transplant recipient’s insurance covers the donor’s medical expenses, but not transportation, lodging, childcare or lost wages. . The 1984 National Organ Transplant Act made it illegal to compensate organ donors – and while the need for living donations is widely recognized, some fear Fry-Revere’s fund enters ethically murky territory.  . “It rings a little close to payment for organs,” said Dr. Talia Baker, a Northwestern University transplant surgeon. “It makes me a little uncomfortable.” . As a member of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons’ Living Donor Committee, Baker does not oppose the fund – if it assists potential donors achieve goals to which they’re already committed. . “If this is the only possible donor, if it wouldn’t coerce that donor or be a final reason for donating, then it is fine,” she said. . Thirty-one-year-old single mother Melissa Brincks of Carroll, Iowa, said that without the fund, she would not have been able to donate a kidney to her brother. She was his only compatible relative. . Her boss at a carpet cleaning company said he would be forced to lay her off and hire her back after her six-week recovery.  . “I didn’t understand how someone could do a good thing and then not know how to take care of their own life in the meantime,” Brincks said. . After her brother’s transplant this week, Fry-Revere’s fund provided her with a grant to cover 40 percent of her lost wages. That check, along with unemployment insurance and caregiving help from her parents, made donation possible. . Seven hundred dollars from an online campaign and church friends was all the assistance 46-year-old Stephanie Washington of Hayward, California, believed she could get while planning to donate a kidney to her 24-year-old niece, a gunshot victim. . “I didn’t know how she was going to pay her bills,” said her sister, Faye Herald, whose research led her to Fry-Revere’s fund. Washington runs a cleaning service and would receive no income during recovery. . Herald applied, submitting documentation that Washington was self-employed. Washington received a check to cover two months of rent and bills following surgery earlier this month. . “It’s such a blessing and relief,” Washington said. “I can relax, and that’s one of the reasons my recovery is going so good. I don’t have to worry.”|Thu Jan 29 19:34:25 +0000 2015||New fund eases expenses for organ donors |5.60883683696341e+17|http://reut.rs/1ES9K2B
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – According to controversial new regulations, female athletes with as much testosterone in their blood as some men are not allowed to compete in women’s sporting events. . In 2011 and 2012, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) implemented new rules barring a female from competing in the women’s category if her blood testosterone level is above 10 nanomoles of testosterone per liter (nmol/L).  . That’s the bottom end of what’s considered a normal range for men. Women usually have less than three nmol/L, according to Dr. Peter Sonksen of Kings College London. Men tend to have 10 to 30 nmol/L. . But 2.5 percent of women have hyperandrogenism, meaning more testosterone in their blood than the reference range for females, usually due to genetics, Sonksen told Reuters Health by email.  . “In most cases it is of no consequence to health but in some cases there may be a tendency to greasy skin and excess body hair and this may be associated with menstrual irregularity and infertility,” and in rare cases can lead to adrenal tumors, he said. . Experts disagree about whether testosterone actually enhances athletic performance, and if this should be a determinant of sports eligibility. That’s one major sticking point in dueling commentaries published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. . “Sports, athleticism in general is inherently unfair,” said Dr. Eric Vilain of the UCLA School of Medicine, who coauthored a commentary in support of the current regulations.  . Sporting ability depends on a variety of genetic and environmental factors, including height, proportion and access to high quality training facilities, Vilain told Reuters Health. . “We could have men and women compete against each other in the same categories, that’s a model we would be fine with, but for the exception that women in most events would systematically lose,” he said.  . He allowed that segregation of male and female sports is an artificial social construct, but since the construct exists it does need to be enforced somehow. . One option is to have athletes simply identify themselves as male or female. . “All women who have been functioning as such in their everyday lives should be allowed to compete on the field of sport,” said Sonksen, who coauthored the commentary opposing the current regulations. . “The notion that female athletes are in need of protection reflects paternalistic and heterosexist assumptions about what ‘real’ women should look like and how they ought to perform,” he said. . But allowing women to self-identify would open the door to men competing as women and committing fraud, Vilain said. . “Sports authorities accept the fact that there are huge variabilites between women in terms of their characteristics, but is there a parameter, is there something that we can easily measure that is very different between men and women and relevant to sport performance?” Vilain said. . In the past, the Y chromosome was the determinant of women’s sports eligibility, but the Y chromosome per se is not very relevant to athletic performance, he said. Some women do carry a Y chromosome but are insensitive to male hormones and develop physiologically as a woman. They would be wrongly disqualified by a chromosome rule, he said. . Shifting from the Y chromosome to testosterone takes the emphasis off of male or female identity, Vilain said. . “There is no good evidence that naturally occurring hyperandrogenism enhances athletic performance,” Sonksen said.   . Many athletes who “dope” do so with testosterone or related products, Vilain said, noting that if the hormone were not improving performance, athletes would not use it to cheat. . Testosterone is linked to bone and muscle development, and it is not far-fetched to say that it is related to athletic performance, Vilain said. . “It is a natural ‘in-built’ and ‘genetically-determined’ attribute akin to height, hand and foot size, body build etc.,” Sonksen said. “In addition, it is unfair to exclude any athlete based on a genetic condition that they have no control over,” he said. . Depending on the international federation governing the particular sport, T testing is mandatory for some women but not others, he noted. If a female athlete tests high for testosterone, she would need to undergo surgical or hormonal procedures to be eligible for the women’s competition, he said. . However, no one is banned from competing altogether based on testosterone, Vilain said. A woman with T in the male range could compete in the men’s category. . The situation is even more complicated for transgender athletes. According to the IOC Stockholm Consensus, issued in 2003, a male to female transgender athlete may compete if she has had her gonads removed at least two years previously, has taken female hormones and has a legal “change of sex,” which is not an option in many countries and in several U.S. states, Vilain said. . The IOM is looking into revisiting this guideline, he noted. . “At the end of the day, these kinds of biological measures will always be imperfect,” he said. . SOURCE: .  and .

Edmund Blair|NAIROBI (Reuters) - Governments and international organizations plan to meet in March to work out how to rebuild three West African nations whose economies have been shattered by Ebola, a U.N. envoy said on Thursday. . The number of newly detected cases of Ebola virus infection has been dropping sharply in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in recent weeks. But the three countries are still reeling from the impact of the outbreak.  . The World Bank in January projected they would lose $1.6 billion in income this year, over 12 percent of their combined economic output. Pre-Ebola economic growth forecasts have been slashed. . “The plans at the moment are for a conference to look at the needs of reconstruction organized by the countries themselves, by the United Nations, by the African Union and by the European Union,” said David Nabarro, the U.N. special envoy on Ebola. . He told Reuters on the sidelines of an African Union summit meeting in Addis Ababa the gathering was expected to be on March 3 in Brussels. . “By that time we anticipate to start to have estimates for what the whole recovery and revival will cost,” he said. . Although the number of Ebola infections detected is clearly falling, “the one challenge we have when this sort of situation happens in an outbreak is that to actually get to zero cases is the hardest part,” Nabarro said. . He said the United Nations needed $1.5 billion to finance its response to the crisis in 2015, with about $500 million covered so far. “We will need more for the response, but also there will be funding needed for reconstruction,” he said. |Thu Jan 29 19:18:41 +0000 2015||March meeting to plan rebuilding of Ebola-hit states |5.608797240342774e+17|http://reut.rs/1ES8eNJ
Natalie Grover|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expanded use of Imbruvica, sold by Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics Inc, to treat Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare form of blood cancer for which no specific pharmaceutical therapy exists. . The decision, announced more than two months before the scheduled review date, marks the fourth indication for the drug.   . WM, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, was discovered more than 70 years ago. It usually worsens slowly over time and causes abnormal blood cells, known as B lymphocytes (B-cells), to grow within the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver and spleen. . Imbruvica works by blocking the enzyme that allows abnormal B-cells to grow and divide. . Since WM was first described, doctors have had to rely on therapies borrowed from similar cancers, said Steven Treon, who led the trial that led to the approval for expanded use. . The FDA granted Imbruvica breakthrough therapy designation for WM, a status given to drugs seen as important advances in the treatment of serious diseases, but it added a warning that it could cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). . TLS is a potentially life-threatening disorder that occurs when a treatment kills cancer cells so quickly that the kidneys cannot expel the breakdown products from the blood. . Since its initial approval in late 2013, the number of safety warnings associated with Imbruvica have increased, said Elliot Favus of Favus Institutional Research, adding that the number of cases of TLS for Imbruvica had risen in the past year. . “We’re learning a lot more about the safety of the drug and it’s not as good as people originally thought when it was first approved,” Favus said. . In contrast, a potential rival drug being developed by AbbVie Inc and Roche Holding AG, ABT-199, has reduced the number of TLS cases in recent trials, he said. . Imbruvica is already used to fight chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Mantle cell lymphoma. . The approval for WM highlights the strength of the franchise, although the disease occurs only in up to 1,500 patients in the United States each year, Roth Capital Partner’s Joseph Pantginis wrote in a note. . Pharmacyclics anticipates U.S. net product revenue of about $1 billion for the drug in 2015, up from $492 million in 2014, the company said earlier this month. . Pharmacyclics shares closed 1.25 percent higher at $167.47, while J&J’s stock ended up about 0.9 percent at $102.38. |Thu Jan 29 18:33:11 +0000 2015||FDA expands use of Imbruvica to treat rare form of blood cancer |5.6086827294683955e+17|http://reut.rs/1ES3Y0O
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) - Many young adults are enthusiastically “vaping” e-cigarettes, drawn by the nifty technology, tasty flavors and their own physical sense that the devices are doing them no harm, according to new research.    . The authors of the small study, which focused on young adults in New York City, say this segment of the vaping population needs more education on the possible health effects of e-cigarettes, including the potential for becoming addicted to nicotine. . A ban on flavors and on marketing tactics that are already prohibited for tobacco could help slow the uptake of e-cigarettes as well, the researchers conclude in the journal Tobacco Control. . “I think my main concern is not so much that this product is going to end up being more toxic than cigarettes - because cigarettes are so toxic you almost can’t come up with a product that is worse - but young adults are still in a stage where they are initiating nicotine use,” Dr. Pamela Ling, one of the study’s two authors, told Reuters Health. . E-cigarettes have grown into a $5 billion global business in recent years, but research into their safety and how and why people use the devices has lagged. Most researchers agree that the nicotine-laced vapor delivered by e-cigarettes contains far fewer toxic chemicals and none of the tar in traditional cigarettes.  . It’s still unclear whether e-cigarettes help smokers to cut down or quit traditional cigarettes, but a growing number are using them to try (see Reuters article of January 29, 2015: . ). . Some research suggests that using nicotine in any form could open a gateway to addiction that leads young people to take up tobacco. California’s chief public health officer issued a report Wednesday calling e-cigarettes a threat to public health and the state’s anti-tobacco efforts (see Reuters article of January 28, 2015: . ). . Many e-cigarette studies have focused on smokers, generally older, some with a declared intent to quit using tobacco. Ling and her coauthor wanted to look at how younger people, who may or may not be smokers, are using e-cigarettes and why.  . The researchers point out in their report that e-cigarette use in the U.S. is highest among young people, with about 14 percent of 18-24 year olds having tried “vaping” in 2013. . In 2012 and 2013, Ling and her colleague recruited 87 men and women between the ages of 18 and 27 years old for a series of focus groups followed by in-depth interviews with a smaller group. About a third of participants had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days. Just over half of those were daily smokers of tobacco and 41 percent smoked less than daily.  . Of the current e-cigarette users, 50 percent said they had no intention to quit smoking in the next six months, 48 percent said they had made a quit attempt in the past 12 months and 31 percent said they were currently trying to quit smoking. . Young adults said they first tried e-cigarettes after friends offered them “puffs” and usually bought the devices in bodegas and smoke shops. They wanted to try the product after seeing commercials and said they considered the devices a fun type of technology. Participants also said they thought the e-cigarette vapor was not as strong or harmful as regular cigarette smoke.   . They also assumed the products were safe because they did not feel sick after smoking them and enjoyed the flavors. . Ling, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said more research was needed on the different types of e-cigarettes devices because some might be more dangerous than others. “The amount of exposure is really variable and there haven’t been studies of long-term use of the products because they haven’t been around that long.” . Ling noted that among the troubling themes that emerged in the study was that young adults were too often relying on advertisements that offered “unsupported, untrue claims” about safety, or going by their own body sensations.   . Thomas Kiklas, co-founder of the non-profit TVECA (Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association), said in an email that his organization set marketing standards “as to not making any mitigating claims of being safer than, healthier than or other claims in comparison to the predicate tobacco cigarette product.” . Kiklas said TVECA lobbied U.S. legislators and the European Union to “establish responsible regulations and standards for the e-Vapor market,” and that he was disappointed in the study. . “My reaction was that it was very narrow in its demographic sampling, dated and not at all a serious attempt to understand the issues the consumer has with understanding the e-Vapor industry, now in its eighth year,” Kiklas said. . Dr. Joanna Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Tobacco Control at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the study offered helpful information on young adult smoking habits as public health officials consider how to regulate the products and educate the public about them. .

|KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has pulled out of some conflict-hit parts of Sudan due to a lack of cooperation from authorities, the medical charity said on Thursday, as the country suffers increasing violence. . Sudan has faced a rebellion in Darfur since 2003 and a separate but linked insurgency in Blue Nile and South Kordofan since the secession of South Sudan in 2011. . The group said that total denial of access to Blue Nile, forced closure of activities in East Darfur and administrative obstacles in South Darfur had made its work in those areas impossible, accusations that Sudan has denied. . “Our experience is that the Sudanese government arranges meetings specifically to prevent international aid, rather than to facilitate it,” Bart Jassens, the director of operations for MSF in Brussels, said in a statement. . Violence has increased in Darfur since the government asked the UN-African Union peacekeeping mission to leave in November, and in Blue Nile and South Kordofan since ceasefire talks collapsed in December. . The organization has ceased operations in East and South Darfur, and will no longer request permission to work in Blue Nile after all of its requests were denied, spokeswoman Beatrice Debut said from Nairobi. . The regions where operations have been halted were run by a Brussels-based section of MSF. The group’s activities in North and West Darfur, which are run by other sections of MSF, would continue, while operations in South Kordodan remain suspended since an MSF hospital was bombed there last week, Debut said. . The Sudanese government denied that it had blocked MSF’s work in Darfur, saying that it had never received requests to work in Blue Nile and that the Belgium-based section of MSF had filed paperwork to leave the country in September. . “This organization had not faced any systematic obstacles to their work in Sudan,” Mohammed Fadlallah, Sudan’s acting commissioner of humanitarian affairs, told Reuters. . “As for the hospital in South Kordofan, this is a mixing of subjects because that is run by the French MSF, which is not registered in Sudan and is working in areas under the control of the insurgency, which is unacceptable and illegal,” he said. |Thu Jan 29 15:01:48 +0000 2015||Medical aid group MSF says pulls out of parts of Sudan |5.608150768534405e+17|http://reut.rs/1A2koF0
Julie Steenhuysen|ATLANTA (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has introduced camera monitoring of workers in its highest-level biosafety laboratories as it seeks to restore public faith in its procedures after a series of mishaps, agency officials tell Reuters. . One lab worker inadvertently risked contracting Ebola last month when they worked with the live virus that was supposed to have been inactivated, or killed. Since last June, the Atlanta-based agency has disclosed several incidents, one in which scientists unknowingly sent potentially live anthrax to a lower-security laboratory and another in which a deadly form of bird flu was sent to an external agency’s lab. . The mishaps have raised major questions over safety practices at more than 1,000 laboratory and support facilities that make up the CDC, whose role is to monitor and prevent outbreaks of disease. . The move to monitor workers will allow lab directors and senior scientists to ensure they have followed safety protocols exactly, Leslie Dauphin, interim director of laboratory safety, told Reuters in an interview. . “You cannot deviate,” she said. “That is what the camera system helps with.” . The agency is expected to release details within a week of its own investigation into the Ebola mishap. . Dauphin, who played a key role in the CDC’s initial response to the incidents, would not comment directly on the contents of the Ebola report, but confirmed that no one had been harmed. . The unidentified scientist, who was working with Ebola specimens that were supposed to have been inactivated, wore gloves and a gown but not a protective face mask or other gear recommended for working with live Ebola, the CDC said. . The anthrax and bird flu accidents touched off a congressional inquiry and a pledge from CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden to overhaul the agency’s safety culture. . The selection process for a new permanent lab safety chief could take months, so Dauphin has introduced new safety measures in the interim. . A total of 67 cameras have been installed in key laboratories to help ensure technicians follow protocols, especially the techniques to render dangerous pathogens harmless before they can be transferred to lower-security labs. . The move follows a strict review late last summer of inactivation methods in each high-security lab. Each lab now has a checklist for performing those procedures and it is up to senior scientists and lab directors to make sure each step is performed correctly. . The camera system will enable supervisors outside of a containment laboratory to review the footage and verify that steps were performed correctly, Dauphin said.  . The video is transmitted from the containment lab via a Wi-Fi network, she said. The videos can be viewed by a supervisor in real time or later. . So far, the CDC has spent around $84,000 on the camera system, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. . Biosafety experts have criticized the CDC for not improving its safety protocols sooner, saying there was a similar pattern of missteps behind the potential exposure of lab workers to live anthrax and Ebola. Some have questioned whether the agency properly tests samples as they leave labs to make sure they are inactivated. . Dauphin said the agency is considering other changes to better differentiate between live and inactive samples of deadly pathogens, including using color-coded or differently sized vials for each. . CDC has also formed for the first time an agency-wide group to offer standardized safety training for lab workers.  . Dauphin said CDC is exploring whether its scientific laboratories should adopt standards set by the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or another external accrediting group. . “This is going to be a huge undertaking. But a part of what I’m doing is to explore how best to begin implementing that process,” she said.  |Thu Jan 29 13:42:55 +0000 2015||Exclusive: CDC installing cameras in labs in agency-wide safety push |5.607952272971612e+17|http://reut.rs/1A20tG0
Magdalena Mis|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The U.N. Children’s Fund launched a record $3.1 billion appeal on Thursday to enable it to help children caught up in a “new generation” of conflicts and disasters round the world, $1 billion more than it sought in 2014. . A series of more complex and destructive crises, natural disasters and emergencies such as the Ebola epidemic, are putting some 60 million children in extraordinary danger of violence, hunger, disease and abuse, UNICEF said. . “From deadly natural disasters to brutal conflicts and fast-spreading epidemics, children across the world are facing a new generation of humanitarian crises,” Afshan Khan, UNICEF director of emergency programs, said in a statement. . “Whether in the headlines or hidden from view, emergencies sparked by social fracture, climate change and disease are stalking children in ways we have never seen before.” . Khan stressed later in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that UNICEF was committed to protecting children regardless of whether or not the crisis that affected them was attracting widespread attention.  . More than one in 10 children now live in countries or regions affected by armed conflict, UNICEF said in the report Humanitarian Action for Children that accompanied the appeal. . The biggest amount in the appeal, $903 million, was for Syria and the region around it, followed by $500 million for West African countries affected by the Ebola epidemic. . More that 5.6 million children need support in Syria, as do 1.7 million who have fled the five-year-old conflict for neighboring countries, UNICEF said. . “For the past four years, these children have been witnessing violence and death daily and have been missing out on the very basics in life,” Khan said in the statement. . “This appeal will help secure a future for not only the children of Syria but all children around the world who are impacted by humanitarian crises.” . Money raised for Ebola-affected areas will be used to isolate and treat new cases and prevent new outbreaks, UNICEF said. . UNICEF also appealed for $32 million for Ukraine, where it said 5.2 million people, one third of them children, were living in conflict zones and 600,000 were displaced. .  As well as drawing attention to the growing number of emergencies, the UNICEF report highlighted the increasing interdependence of humanitarian and development work. . UNICEF said the funds raised would also help strengthen national preparedness systems against future disasters. . The appeal, which covers 71 countries and a total of 98 million people, includes underfunded and forgotten crises, including Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories and Niger.  . “It’s peak time just after the election (in Afghanistan) and we do want to make sure that there is some restoration of basic services for kids there,” Khan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Geneva. . In the Palestinian Territories UNICEF wants to restore access to education for some 30,000 children and provide them with psycho-social support for trauma, she said. . The agency also wants to reach half a million children there with mine-risk education and awareness programs. . In Niger, UNICEF will focus on malnutrition and measles vaccinations and on Ebola prevention programs, Khan said. . Cameroon, struggling with an influx of refugees from Nigeria, which is battling Boko Haram Islamist militants, is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis, said Khan. . “(We) want to make sure that host communities are not at an  additional disadvantage as a result of an influx of people and to beef up services for nutrition, water and sanitation and health,” she said. . “We are going to have to have some very strong child protection activities ... to make sure that there’s no further recruitment of children into armed groups.” . Khan stressed that UNICEF has an equal commitment to children regardless of whether the crises that affect them make headlines. . “To me, whether it’s Cameroon, Central African Republic, Niger or Palestine, those kids all deserve an equal chance and equal opportunity,” she said. . “Where a child is born (should not) determine their destiny and whether they’re going to get humanitarian assistance or not.” |Thu Jan 29 12:46:35 +0000 2015||UNICEF makes record appeal to help 60 million children in crisis |5.607810504573706e+17|http://reut.rs/1ERoLBH
|ABUJA, Nigeria (Reuters) - An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Nigerian poultry farms has spread to four more states, raising the total of affected areas to 11, the agricultural and rural development minister said on Thursday.  . Africa’s most populous country and biggest economy was the  first country on the continent to detect bird flu, in 2006 when chicken farms were found to have the H5N1 strain. In 2007, Nigeria recorded its first human death from the disease. . “At the time of my briefing the nation on January 21, 2015, seven states had reported cases of the bird flu. As of yesterday, a total of 11 states have reported positive cases,” Minister Akinwumi Adesina said at an emergency meeting with state agricultural commissioners in the capital Abuja. . The latest bird flu outbreak was first reported in mid-January in the states of Kano and Lagos. The worst-hit state is Kano in the north where 136,905 birds were exposed with a 13 percent mortality rate. . The other affected states are Ogun, Rivers, Delta, Edo, Plateau, Gombe, Imo, Oyo and Jigawa. . Adesina said the government planned to compensate farmers with 145 million naira ($763,150), or about 1,450 naira ($7.63) per lost bird, within the next three days. |Thu Jan 29 11:52:32 +0000 2015||Nigeria H5N1 bird flu spreads to four more states, total 11 |5.607674447098143e+17|http://reut.rs/1ERiyWq
|OSLO (Reuters) - Norway reported its first ever case of mad cow disease on Thursday, saying the instance was an isolated one and telling consumers it was still safe to eat beef and drink milk. . Tests at a British laboratory confirmed the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in a 15-year-old cow, which had been slaughtered, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority said. . The case was atypical, meaning there had been no transmission through the feed supply and it was not related to any wider outbreak, the authority said. . Since BSE was first identified in Britain in 1986, strict controls have tempered the spread of the disease.  . But after its emergence, scientists became concerned about possible links, via the consumption of contaminated tissue, between BSE and a human illness called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, nvCJD, killed dozens of people in Europe beginning in the mid-1990s. . Norwegian authorities said several other cows that had been in contact with the dead animal would also be slaughtered.  . “The discovery of BSE has no impact on food safety and it is just as safe to eat meat and drink milk as before,” it said. . However, the discovery would affect some food export certificates.  . Awaiting the test results, Norway last week suspended issuing export permits saying that there had been no known cases of mad cow diseases in the country. Export certificates would have to be rephrased, and perhaps renegotiated. |Thu Jan 29 11:36:56 +0000 2015||Norway finds first case of mad cow disease, says food safe |5.607635200240681e+17|http://reut.rs/1ERh3rd
Tom Miles|GENEVA (Reuters) - The number of new confirmed Ebola cases totaled 99 in the week to Jan. 25, the lowest tally since June 2014, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, signaling the tide might have turned against the epidemic.  . “The response to the EVD (Ebola virus disease) epidemic has now moved to a second phase, as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic,” the WHO said.  . “To achieve this goal as quickly as possible, efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding, case management, safe burials, and community engagement is used as effectively as possible.”  . The outbreak has killed 8,810 people out of 22,092 known cases, almost all of them in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. . Cases and deaths have fallen rapidly in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the past few weeks, with just 20 deaths recorded in Liberia in the 21 days to Jan. 25.  . But Guinea reported 30 confirmed cases in the latest week, up from 20 in the previous week. The epidemic is also still spreading geographically there, with a first confirmed case in Guinea’s Mali prefecture bordering Senegal, which reopened its border with Guinea on Monday. . A resurgence of the virus in Guinea, where the outbreak began, would threaten President Alpha Conde’s goal of eradicating Ebola from the country by early March.  . “It is too early to declare a success or a deadline for success,” Dr. Peter Salama, global Ebola emergency coordinator for the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF), told a news briefing. . “Our work is far from over. During the course of this outbreak, we have repeatedly under-estimated this pathogen. We now have a time-limited window of opportunity to eliminate the virus, by April or May the rains will set in in West Africa, limiting our access and our ability to find cases and trace their contacts,” he said. . Some 10,000 children have lost one or both parents to the Ebola virus, while five million children have been deprived of education, Salama said. . “Guinea reopened the schools last week, Liberia will do so next week and Sierra Leone won’t be far behind. It is a really important sign of some semblance of a return to normalcy for these societies,” he said. . Disease experts say that tracking down everyone who has had close contact with an Ebola patient is crucial to ending the outbreak. But in dozens of remote villages in Guinea, angry residents are blocking access for health workers. . The most intense transmission in Guinea is in Forecariah district, amid reports of “high levels of community resistance to response measures” in the area that is close to the border with western Sierra Leone — the worst Ebola hotspot. |Thu Jan 29 09:39:40 +0000 2015||Weekly Ebola cases below 100, WHO says endgame begins |5.6073400968964506e+17|http://reut.rs/1A17iHQ
Ben Hirschler|LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had struck four research agreements in the hot area of genome editing as it bets on a new “genetic scissors” technology to deliver better and more precise drugs for a range of diseases. . The academic and commercial tie-ups will allow British-based AstraZeneca to use so-called CRISPR technology across its entire drug discovery platform in areas such as oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory and immune system medicine. . CRISPR, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, allows scientists to edit the genes of selected cells accurately and efficiently. It has created excitement since emerging two years ago and is already being tipped for a Nobel Prize. . The collaborations with Britain’s Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Innovative Genomics Initiative in California, the Broad Institute and Whitehead Institute in Massachusetts, and Thermo Fisher Scientific build on an in-house CRISPR programme at AstraZeneca that has been running for over a year. . Other drugmakers, keen to exploit the potential of a powerful new scientific tool, are also forming alliances.  . Earlier this month Switzerland’s Novartis struck deals with Intellia Therapeutics and Caribou Biosciences, two unlisted U.S. biotech companies that have been set up to take advantage of CRISPR. . While certain existing techniques already allow scientists to add genes to cells, CRISPR lets them make changes in specific genes far faster and in a much more precise way. It is also much easier to handle in the laboratory. . The technique is based on a naturally occurring system that bacteria use to defend themselves against viral infection and incorporates enzymatic “scissors” that cut DNA in the cell nucleus. . It is already being used by academic researchers seeking to understand how cells work and the hope is that it will now help in the design of improved drugs. . AstraZeneca believes the technology will let it identify and validate new drug targets more quickly, accelerating the drug development process. It should also reduce the failure rate for experimental compounds as they move from preclinical tests into clinical trials, making drug research more cost-effective.      . “CRISPR is a simple yet powerful tool that enables us to manipulate genes of potential importance in disease pathways and examine the impact of these modifications in a highly precise way,” said Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca’s head of innovative medicines and early development. . No financial details of the collaborations were disclosed but AstraZeneca said it would share cell lines and compounds with its partners, based on an “open innovation” research model. Neither side will own any targets identified.   |Thu Jan 29 07:31:22 +0000 2015||AstraZeneca bets on gene editing for broad range of new drugs |5.607017210608558e+17|http://reut.rs/1A0KJTD
Jilian Mincer|NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Marty Weinstein decided to quit smoking, he took a friend’s advice and tried electronic cigarettes rather than government-approved nicotine replacement products. . Weinstein, 58, has gone from a pack a day nine months ago to the equivalent in nicotine of four or five cigarettes. The e-cigs have a familiar look and feel, and quench his desire to hold on to a cigarette and puff. . “I fully understand I’m still addicted to nicotine,” said Weinstein, a Connecticut taxi driver who had smoked for more than 20 years. “But I’m now so much healthier.” . E-cigarettes, metal tubes that heat liquids typically laced with nicotine and deliver vapor when sucked, are transforming the market for smoking cessation products and slowing the $2.4 billion in global sales of long-standing aids such as nicotine patches and gums. But their impact on health remains unclear, experts say, raising difficult questions for regulators who are starting to impose limits on e-cigarette use.  . E-cigarette makers in the United States are barred from explicitly marketing the products as smoking cessation devices, but have found ways to appeal legally to smokers who are thinking of quitting. . “You never say ‘quit’ because it’s not approved by the FDA as a smoking cessation device,” said Jose Castro, the chief executive of A1 Vapors in Miami, referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . A1 Vapors runs an ad on its website urging customers to “kiss tobacco goodbye” and give themselves the “gift of your life. literally”, adding a disclaimer that e-cigs are not a smoking cessation product. . E-cigarettes, or e-cigs, have only come into widespread use in the past few years, but have already made inroads into traditional quitting therapies. . About a third of British smokers trying to quit were using e-cigarettes, according to a University College London survey in January of 1,800 people, including 450 smokers. . E-cigs are used by almost twice as many people as government-approved nicotine gums, lozenges and patches, according to the survey. That was a reversal from 2011, when only about 5 percent of people were using e-cigarettes and more than 30 percent used over-the-counter products. . Similar data is not yet publicly available for the United States. . Worldwide sales of all nicotine replacement therapies grew just 1.2 percent last year, to almost $2.4 billion, according to data from commercial researcher Euromonitor. U.S. sales, at $900 million, grew 0.2 percent, and are expected by Euromonitor to drop this year by that amount. . Big tobacco companies like Altria, Lorillard and Reynolds American have rushed into the e-cig market. The entire U.S. market for “vapor devices” such as e-cigs grew in 2014 by 40-50 percent to $2.5 billion to $3 billion, Euromonitor said. The global market is worth $5 billion. . RULES ON E-CIGS TIGHTENING . Mark Strobel, a consumer health analyst at Euromonitor, said e-cigarettes have slowed nicotine replacement therapy sales, along with relatively high prices and a shrinking population of smokers, especially in the United States. . “For some consumers it has been a direct substitution.” . GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Johnson & Johnson don’t break out the data on their smoking cessation products, which are relatively small parts of their sales, but the companies have noted the change. . “It’s definitely taken a bit of our market, no question at all - but there’s a lot of competition in that space,” GSK chief executive Andrew Witty told Reuters in an interview this month. . GSK’s nicotine replacement therapies and smoking cessation products include the brands Nicorette, NicoDermCQ and the medicine Zyban.  . There is little long-term safety data on e-cigarettes, although some healthcare professionals say they may be better for consumers than tobacco cigarettes because they have no carbon monoxide and fewer cancer-causing chemicals. . A growing number of states, cities and countries - including Israel and Australia - are considering or have approved legislation to ban or limit the devices or the liquids, which come in exotic flavors from bacon to bubble gum.  . California’s top public health official on Wednesday slammed e-cigs as addictive, saying they were leading to nicotine poisoning among children and threatened to unravel the state’s decades-long effort to reduce tobacco use. . Earlier this week, California introduced a bill that would ban the devices in public places, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a similar ban earlier this month.  . Last year, the World Health Organization recommended that smokers should be encouraged to try already approved treatments rather than e-cigarettes. The FDA last April proposed rules for electronic cigarettes that would, among other things, ban sales to those under 18, but not restrict flavored products, online sales or advertising.   . Many health experts worry that e-cigarettes will become established as smoking cessation aids before enough research is done to determine their health impact. Another concern is that they may stop people from quitting tobacco completely and deter people from trying potentially more effective methods. . Dr. Albert Rizzo, senior medical advisor for the American Lung Association, said that when patients ask about the products, he tells them it’s good that they are trying to quit but: “We don’t know enough to recommend them.” . Some healthcare professionals said that even if they are not opposed to e-cigarettes, they are concerned about their marketing, especially to young people. . The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment on specific e-cig ads but said “advertising must be truthful, non-deceptive and supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.” . E-cigs risk bringing the “cool” back to smoking, reversing the progress over decades in which smoking has become less socially acceptable, said Dr. Robert K. Jackler, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. . “A lot of us are very concerned about the renormalization phenomenon,” he said. “These glamorize smoking behavior.”  . Still, some doctors point to the low efficacy of traditional ways to quit smoking. . “They have better results than placebos, but their rates of success are quite low,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health, who said e-cigarettes are an alternative, especially for people who have tried the conventional therapies and failed. |Thu Jan 29 06:28:16 +0000 2015||As smokers spark up e-cigs to quit, traditional aids suffer |5.6068584367826534e+17|http://reut.rs/1EQQ3Ie
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration estimates that up to 29 percent of U.S. taxpayers could have to take the law known as Obamacare into account as they complete their 2014 income tax returns, officials said on Wednesday. . Two to 4 percent are expected to pay a penalty for failing to obtain health coverage last year under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, according to official estimates.  . Treasury and healthcare officials told reporters that 3 percent to 5 percent could have to reconcile the federal subsidies they received to help pay for health coverage in 2014, if fluctuations in their income led them to receive too much or too little assistance. . Another 10 percent to 20 percent of taxpayers are expected to use their tax filings to seek exemptions from the law’s coverage requirements. That would constitute 15 million to 20 million people.  . The estimates are based on U.S. Treasury expectations for about 150 million income tax filings, which are due to the Internal Revenue Service by an April 15 deadline.   . This year marks the first time that the public must take health coverage into account as part of their tax calculations. The administration said it would work with a nearly a dozen tax preparers and nonprofit groups to help consumers navigate the new requirements. . The group includes tax preparers H&R Block Inc, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc [JAKHT.UL] and Intuit Inc, whose products include TurboTax. . The IRS is also waiving penalties that people might otherwise face if they were found to owe insurance subsidies back to the federal government. . The Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to have health coverage and fines eligible consumers who failed to obtain it in 2014 $95 or 1 percent of household income, whichever is higher. The penalty is set to rise in 2015 and 2016. . Most of the 6.7 million people who were enrolled in private coverage through online insurance exchanges at the end of 2014 received federal subsidies, based on their income, to help pay for premiums or other expenses. Still others received subsidies but did not remain in the markets for the entire year, officials said.   . Those whose incomes fluctuated over the year could now owe money back or qualify for a tax windfall.   . The Department of Health and Human Services is sending out 4 million official forms that will specify the amount of federal subsidies consumers received after enrolling in health coverage through the federal website, Healthcare.gov. |Wed Jan 28 22:44:40 +0000 2015||U.S. government says Obamacare could affect up to 29 percent of taxpayers |5.605691728755712e+17|http://reut.rs/1EQfmue
Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California’s top public health official on Wednesday said electronic cigarettes are addictive, leading to nicotine poisoning among children and threatening to unravel the state’s decades-long effort to reduce tobacco use. . The report by California Department of Public Health Director Ron Chapman comes as the state legislature is debating whether to regulate e-cigarettes under the state’s tobacco regulations. . “E-cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful chemicals, and the nicotine in them is as addictive as the nicotine in cigarettes,” Chapman said. “I am advising Californians to avoid the use of e-cigarettes and keep them away from children of all ages.” . Chapman’s report drew criticism from the growing e-cigarette industry, which says the heated liquid that users inhale is not as dangerous as the by-products of burning tobacco in regular cigarettes, cigars and pipes. . “This report inappropriately paints this complex and important public health topic as a black and white issue,” said Gregory Conley, President of the American Vaping Association. Vaping is a nickname for using e-cigarettes, which involves inhaling vapor from liquid heated by the device. . “Despite the health officer’s false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking,” Conley said. . According to Chapman’s report, 7.6 percent of California’s young adults aged 18-29 used electronic cigarettes in 2013, up from 2.3 percent in 2012. Among children under the age of five, incidents of nicotine poisoning rose from seven in 2012 to 154 in 2014, the report said. . “Of particular concern to me is the impact of e-cigarettes on the health and safety of children, teens and young adults,” Chapman said. The flavors of the liquid in the devices include cotton candy, gummy bear, chocolate mint and grape, making them appealing to youth, he said. . The benefits and risks of e-cigarettes are the subject of intense debate.  . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is exploring potential product standards in the areas of addiction, toxicity and product appeal. But the head of the FDA’s tobacco division has also noted that e-cigarettes do not flood the lungs with smoke and tar as regular cigarettes do. . On Monday, Democratic state Senator Mark Leno of San Francisco introduced a bill to regulate e-cigarettes under the state’s tobacco control laws. . Leno’s bill would make it illegal to use e-cigarettes in most public places, including schools, hospitals, job sites, restaurants and bars. It would also increase penalties for selling them to children. |Wed Jan 28 22:37:57 +0000 2015||California's top public health official slams e-cigarettes |5.605674816063406e+17|http://reut.rs/1zZlAcc
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning adolescents who face bullying and other types of abuse have been told in the media, “It gets better” - and new research supports that claim. . In a multi-year study of LGBTQ youth, researchers found that being the victim of bullying and other abuse was linked to psychological distress, but both distress and victimization decreased as the adolescents grew up. . “I think we should be very happy that it does get better, but I think it’s important not to forget victimization is important and happens very early,” said Michelle Birkett, the study’s lead author. “It’s not good enough to just wait. It should be tackled early on so kids don’t have to experience it.” . “I want it to get better sooner,” said Birkett, a research scientist at the IMPACT LGBT Health and Development Program of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. . LGBT youth are at increased risk of being bullied. For example, they were twice as likely as their peers to report being physically assaulted at school, in a survey of 10,000 teens by the U.S.-based Human Rights Campaign. . In 2010, columnist and author Dan Savage created the “It Gets Better Project” in response to growing attention to bullying and suicide among LGBT youth. . More than 50,000 videos appeared online of people sharing the message, “It Gets Better,” with personal stories, according to the project’s website (. ). Many videos featured well-known figures, including U.S. President Barack Obama and singer Adam Lambert. . “I wanted to see if it really does get better,” said Birkett. . As reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, the researchers used data from 231 LGBTQ young men and women who were ages 16 to 20 at the start of the study.  . The teens were assessed six times over an average of three and a half years beginning in 2007 or 2008. They rated the amount of bullying or victimization they experienced in the past six months on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being never and 3 being three or more times. At age 16, their average victimization score was 0.38, compared to 0.14 by age 24. . They also rated their psychological distress on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being “not at all” and 4 meaning “always.” On average, the distress scores were 0.84 at age 16. By age 24, the average score fell to 0.54. . Males, some racial and ethnic minorities and transgender individuals reported greater victimization. . The researchers found that victimization was indeed linked with psychological distress, which suggests that decreasing victimization across childhood and adolescence may decrease distress in those populations too. . The study team also found that support, such as from family members, remained relatively stable across adolescence. While that support provided some immediate relief for psychological distress, there was no link between the amount of support the young person got and later distress. . “Family support is important, but it doesn’t really protect against the negative effect of bullying and victimization,” said Brian Mustanski, the study’s senior author and director of IMPACT. . “Go into that school where the bullying is happening and eliminate the bullying,” he said. . Caitlin Ryan, director of the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University, said one of the study’s important messages is the ongoing need for prevention and support. . That may include educating family members about their roles as advocates and creating accepting and inclusive school environments, said Ryan, who was not involved in the new study. . “There are thousands and thousands of school districts,” she said. “Many school districts have stepped up and done a good job, but others have not.” . Mustanski said school districts should find anti-bullying programs that are backed by science. . “Look for programs that have evidence that they work,” he said. . For adolescents who are currently having a difficult time, Ryan said it’s important that they reach out for help from a trusted adult. . “There are so many resources now that can provide help and support and give young people hope,” she said. .

|(Reuters) - Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd said it would restate financial statements for all of 2013 and the first three quarters of 2014, adding to the drugmaker’s list of woes.  . The restatement, which corrects errors related to the timing of revenue recognition, revenue-reducing returns, discounts and expenses, will cumulatively reduce reported net product revenue by about $20.7 million and net income by about $11.9 million, the company said. . Salix reported net product revenue of $933.8 million and adjusted net income of $246.9 million for 2013. . Reuters reported this month that the maker of bowel drugs was working with investment bank Centerview Partners Holdings LP to explore options including a sale. . Salix Chief Executive Carolyn Logan stepped down earlier in January following the departure of other top executives. . The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company slashed its full-year forecast in November after inventory for its key drugs piled up. The inventory issue was to blame for Botox maker Allergan Inc’s decision to end talks to acquire Salix, sources told Reuters at the time.  . Salix said in December it would clear the excess inventory by the end of 2015. . The company said on Wednesday that the restatement would not impact its 2015 and 2016 forecasts. . Salix shares were up 1.3 percent at $129.50. |Wed Jan 28 22:37:56 +0000 2015||Salix Pharma to restate past seven quarters' results |5.605674781376635e+17|http://reut.rs/1zZlxNr
Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some insurers selling policies under Obamacare may be structuring drug coverage in a way that dissuades people with HIV-AIDS from becoming their customers, according to a study published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. . President Barack Obama’s 2010 Affordable Care Act outlawed discrimination based on pre-existing conditions. Insurers cannot ask about current or past illnesses, charge people with, say, diabetes or cancer more than healthy people, or deny coverage. . Some, however, have found a way to discriminate anyway, wrote researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “resorting to other tactics to dissuade high-cost patients” from enrolling. . Traditionally, insurers use formularies, lists of covered drugs and their out-of-pocket costs, to steer patients toward generic drugs or medicine for which a company has negotiated a favorable price. But formularies can be structured to put off people with pre-existing conditions, said co-author Ben Sommers. . He and Douglas Jacobs analyzed 48 Obamacare policies in 12 states using the federal Healthcare.gov marketplace. In 2014, 12 of the policies placed all covered HIV drugs called nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, including generics, in tiers with at least a 30 percent co-pay, usually the highest. Some did not cover the drugs at all. . Customers in the 12 plans had an average annual cost per HIV drug more than triple that of customers in the other plans, $4,892 compared with $1,615. . Premiums in plans with the highest out-of-pocket costs for HIV drugs were lower than others’, but someone with HIV would pay $3,000 more each year, the researchers calculated. . “This matches what we’ve seen in Illinois, where four of seven plans have what we consider unaffordable HIV drugs,” said John Peller, president of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. “We think insurers are looking for ways to make plans less welcoming to people with chronic conditions.” . Insurers disagree. . “Individuals can pick the policy that is best for them,” said Clare Krusing, spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s lobbying group. Subsidies “reduce out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs even more.” . In addition, Obamacare requires that insurers with few costly patients pay those with many, so deterring HIV customers makes no financial sense, she said. . Most of that transfer program phases out after 2016, however. . In late 2014, the Obama administration proposed a rule that would consider policies with all drugs for a condition in the highest out-of-pocket tier discriminatory and therefore disallowed. |Wed Jan 28 22:37:55 +0000 2015||Some Obamacare insurers discriminate against AIDS patients: study |5.605674762502185e+17|http://reut.rs/1EQeIwF
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - First results from a human trial of an Ebola vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline show it is safe and generates an immune response, scientists said on Wednesday, but larger trials are needed to see if it protects and if a booster is needed.     . The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week. . That trial is the first of several mid-stage studies planned for West Africa and aims to test GSK’s vaccine and one from Merck and NewLink. Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic have a vaccine in early-stage clinical tests. . The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system.     . “The safety profile is pretty much as we’d hoped and the immune responses are okay, but not great,” he told Reuters. . The data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year.  . The volunteers got one of three doses - low, medium, or high - and data from 28 days after vaccination showed the shot was safe at these doses, with only mild side effects. . “People typically experienced mild symptoms that lasted for one or maybe two days, such as pain or reddening at the injection site, and occasionally people felt feverish,” Hill said. . However, the antibody response was weaker than was found in a trial of the same Ebola vaccine in macaque monkeys, in which the animals were also found to be protected. . Hill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system’s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed. . Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”. . “However, we still don’t know whether it will provide protection against Ebola infection in a real-world situation,” he said. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.” |Wed Jan 28 22:22:25 +0000 2015||Trial finds GSK Ebola shot is safe and provokes immune response |5.6056357519938765e+17|http://reut.rs/1zZimWb
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – - Adding spice – in the form of curcumin supplements – to the daily diets of people with risk factors for heart disease may lower inflammation, a new study suggests. . Inflammation is implicated in a wide range of illnesses, from heart disease to cancer and joint pain. In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers. . “Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.  . “Two key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,” said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email. . These properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease. . Having a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.   . Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.   . Half were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks. . At the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.  . They found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers. . The study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.  . “The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,” Sahebkar said. . The researchers didn’t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it’s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report. . The study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements. . Sahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician. . “Curcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,” Sahebkar said.  . However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said. . “In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,” Sahebkar said. . Sahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.  . “Whilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,” he said. . Sahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally. .

|(Reuters) - UK retailer Tesco Plc has recalled its No Added Sugar Double Concentrate Apple and Blackcurrant squash drink after getting complaints from customers regarding a foul smell coming from them. . “A flavor additive, which is not part of the ingredients for this product, has been added in error. The additive is called Dimethyl Disulphide and is a common ingredient in food products. It is an approved additive and poses no food safety risk,” a Tesco spokesperson said on Wednesday.  . The company said this addictive has a strong odor, similar to garlic which customers are likely to find unpleasant. . Tesco said customers can return this product(750ml and 1.5l), open or unopened, to any Tesco store. . “Only products bought since the New Year may be affected. They will have a best before date of October 2015,” the spokesperson added.  . The company said it investigated the complaints with its supplier. |Wed Jan 28 22:04:11 +0000 2015||Tesco recalls squash after complaints of 'foul' smell |5.605589847266017e+17|http://reut.rs/1EQbrxi
Roxanne Nelson|(Reuters Health) – A large international analysis finds that statin drugs reduce heart risk factors like high cholesterol as effectively in women as they do in men. . The results, based on pooled data from 22 clinical trials, include a finding that reductions in deaths from any cause were similar for men and women taking statins. There has been debate over whether statins benefit women as much as they do men. . “This can give reassurance to clinicians that when treating a female patient they can apply the same risk-based considerations when prescribing statin therapy as for men,” said Dr. Jordan Fulcher, a cardiologist and research fellow at the NHMRC Clinical Trials Center at the University of Sydney in Australia.  . “In particular we demonstrated a significant all-cause mortality reduction for women taking statins, a finding which was not reported in any of the individual trials,” said Fulcher, one of the report’s lead authors, in an email to Reuters Health. . One expert cautioned, however, that doctors should take into consideration women’s overall – generally lower – risk for heart disease compared to men, as well as some risks posed by the statins themselves when assessing a woman’s need for the drugs. . Statins, which include atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and others, block the body’s production of cholesterol. High or abnormal cholesterol levels are considered a major risk factor for developing clogged and hardened blood vessels, which can lead to heart attacks and stroke. . Previous studies of statin therapy for women have reached mixed conclusions. Some found that statins may not benefit women who were at a low risk of cardiovascular disease, as compared to men, while others have found the drugs to be helpful for both.  . The current analysis is the largest to date and was conducted by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration, a joint initiative coordinated by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Center in Sydney and the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU) at the University of Oxford in the UK.  . The analysis includes data on more than 174,000 patients. According to the results in The Lancet, the main measurement was the amount of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol reduction during one year on statins – and that number was the same for women and men. . The reduction in major cardiovascular events like heart attacks relative to the LDL reduction and overall were also very similar in women and men. That included people at less than 10 percent risk of a major event, the authors note. . “Overall this study tells us that statins have a similar effectiveness in men and women at all levels of vascular risk,” Fulcher told Reuters Health. “This ranges from men and women in the primary prevention setting at a ‘lower’ level of vascular risk to men and women with previous vascular disease, such as a heart attack or stroke, or who have already had bypass surgery, and are at a high risk of future events.” . “Now we can say that statins appear to work just as effectively in both sexes,” Fulcher said. “What questions remain are questions that apply to both sexes.” . Despite the results, questions still remain about women and the use of statins, wrote Dr. Lori Mosca, a professor at Columbia University Medical Center and director of Preventive Cardiology at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, in an editorial that accompanied the study. . “I agree with the authors that the proportionate risk reduction with statins was similar for men and women, when other factors considered were equal,” she writes. But the “challenge is that the factors not considered by the investigators - such as absolute risk reduction - might not be equal,” she notes. . The study provides more information about statin use in women, Mosca told Reuters Health. “We know more but still not enough.” . For women without any history of heart problems, the number of women that would need to take statins to prevent a major cardiovascular event is generally higher than for men, she notes, due to the fact that women have a lower short-term risk. . As with any drug, statins do carry a risk of side effects, including growing evidence that their use is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, Mosca said. She pointed out that the study did not address sex-based differences in side effects.  . “We need more long term safety data for men and women,” she said in an email. “Also, it is important for healthcare providers to give equal opportunity for therapy if baseline risk is similar.” . Thus far, there are no indications of long term risks in either men or women, according to Fulcher, who said Collaboration will be publishing another analysis in the future that will present that data.  .

Caroline Humer|(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Wednesday backed Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni as the preferred hepatitis C treatment on its 2015 commercial drug coverage list, another victory for Gilead over competitor AbbVie Inc. . Gilead and AbbVie have been battling for hepatitis C market share since the approval in December for an AbbVie drug that challenges Gilead’s blockbusters. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been striking deals for preferred or exclusive status in exchange for discounts for 2015. . UnitedHealth’s drug coverage list, which is effective Feb. 1, applies to all of the company’s commercial, fully insured customers who use its Optum RX pharmacy benefit manager and self-insured customers such as large employers who follow the drug list. . The update to the formulary, available on the company’s website, also applies to its Medicaid, Medicare and military contracts.  . “We are constantly working to deliver value and manage costs for customers and consumers throughout our business,” UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in a statement. . Gilead declined to comment.  . Gilead set off a firestorm last year when it launched a breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C called Sovaldi that carries an $84,000-per-treatment price tag. . Insurers, including UnitedHealth, were taken by surprise by its cost and called it out as an unexpected hit to profits last year.  . Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, pushed back against the price of Sovaldi and Gilead’s follow-up drug Harvoni, which has a list price of $93,400. It backed AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, saying it had gotten a significant discount. . Analysts and investors say the treatments are being discounted by at least 30 percent. The companies have declined to comment. . UnitedHealth is the last of the top three U.S. insurers to strike a deal with either Gilead or AbbVie. Reuters reported two weeks ago that Aetna Inc had backed Gilead, as have Anthem Inc and Humana Inc. Pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health also went with Gilead while smaller competitor Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list. . The state of Missouri earlier this week said it had selected AbbVie’s Viekira Pak for Medicaid patients who meet certain criteria, and said the agreement would reduce treatment costs by 30 to 40 percent. . UnitedHealth has 45 million medical customers. Of those, 18 million are employed by companies that are self-insured and use UnitedHealth to administer their plan benefits; not all those employers follow UnitedHealth’s commercial drug guideline or use UnitedHealth for their drug benefits. . Gilead shares, which closed down 2.5 percent at $102.45, were trading slightly higher in after-hours activity at $103.11. |Wed Jan 28 21:23:39 +0000 2015||UnitedHealth backs Gilead's Harvoni as preferred hepatitis C treatment |5.6054878627640934e+17|http://reut.rs/1EQ6W61

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - When patients with Parkinson’s disease received an injection described as an effective drug costing $1,500 per dose, their motor function improved significantly more than when they got one supposedly costing $100, scientists reported on Wednesday. . Underlining the power of expectations, the motor improvements, measured by a standard Parkinson’s assessment, occurred even though both injections contained only saline and no active ingredients. . The research, said an editorial in the journal Neurology, which published it, “takes the study of placebo effect to a new dimension.” . More and more studies have documented the power of placebos, in which patients experience an improvement in symptoms despite receiving sugar pills, sham surgery, or other intervention with no intrinsic therapeutic value. Placebo responses have been shown to alleviate pain, depression, and osteoarthritis, among other conditions. . That has posed challenges for drugmakers, since clinical trials typically pit an experimental compound against a placebo. When placebos are powerful, actual drugs often fail to best them. . Earlier studies have shown that patients’ expectations can lead to improvements in Parkinson’s, a progressive motor disease in which the brain’s production of dopamine plummets. . As it happens, dopamine release is increased by belief, novelty, and the expectation of reward - mental states that underlie placebo effects, said neurologist Alberto Espay of the University of Cincinnati, who led the new study. . He and colleagues told 12 Parkinson’s patients they would receive shots of two formulations of equal effectiveness of the same drug, getting the second after the first wore off. One cost $100 to manufacture, they were told; the other, $1,500. . In reality, both were saline. . When patients received the “$1,500” drug first, their motor function improved two-fold compared to cheap placebo, and 28 percent over baseline, but less than with the Parkinson’s drug levodopa. . Because the study deceived the 12 volunteers, usually a bioethics no-no, it received extra scrutiny from the review board that okays human research. . When the volunteers were debriefed, Espay said, eight said they expected the “expensive” drug to be more effective; they experienced the greatest improvement relative to the “cheap” injection. Four said they had no expectation of greater benefits, “and they showed little overall changes” in motor function, Espay said. . Ordinarily, a study with only a dozen people would not be published in a top journal. But because earlier studies, going back more than a decade, have also shown a placebo effect in Parkinson’s, the research has greater credibility, experts said. |Wed Jan 28 21:23:38 +0000 2015||'Expensive' placebo beats 'cheap' one in Parkinson's disease: study |5.605487827615908e+17|http://reut.rs/1EQ6Ye5
|(Reuters) - Medtronic’s CoreValve non-invasive aortic valve replacement system led to significantly fewer deaths than open heart surgery after one year in patients who had previously undergone coronary bypass procedures, according to data from a clinical trial. . One year after a diseased valve was replaced using the CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system, 11.4 percent of high-risk patients had died or suffered a major stroke versus 21.8 percent among those who had the valve replaced surgically. . There was no significant difference in major strokes alone, so most of the benefit seen in the combined data point came from a reduction in all cause mortality, researchers found.  . The data came from a sub-analysis of a larger trial of high risk heart patients, and looked only at the 226 who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, known as CABG. . “The CoreValve System demonstrated important clinical advantages, including faster recovery compared to surgical valve replacement, offering heart teams an alternative to open heart surgery for this patient population,” said Dr. John Conte, a professor of surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, who presented the data at the Society of Thoracic Surgeons meeting in San Diego, in a statement. . The analysis also showed significantly reduced complications for TAVR patients after one year, including lower rates of acute kidney injury (5.3 percent vs 16.3 percent) and life threatening or disabling bleeding (14.0 percent vs. 43.5 percent). . TAVR systems are increasingly being used as an alternative to chest-cracking open heart surgery for patients with aortic stenosis. Using a catheter, the valve is threaded through an artery and into place in the heart.   . CoreValve competes with the Sapien TAVR system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp. They are considered important growth drivers for the companies. . The TAVR systems are currently approved for use in patients deemed too frail to undergo surgery or those considered to be at high risk. Both companies are testing their systems in moderate risk patients with the aim toward gaining approval to treat a larger portion of the population. |Wed Jan 28 17:43:11 +0000 2015||Medtronic CoreValve safer than surgery in bypass patients: study |5.6049330310454886e+17|http://reut.rs/1EPIIsA
Thin Lei Win|BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Asia-Pacific region will not meet the goal of ending the HIV epidemic in 15 years unless it changes laws and attitudes hostile to people living with HIV, the head of the United Nations agency on AIDS said on Wednesday.  . Governments need to spend more on programs targeting key groups, improve access to lifesaving drugs and overhaul punitive laws that stop people seeking help, Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  . “I’m fully convinced that if you don’t address these issues ... it’s impossible to end HIV/AIDS,” said Sidibé, speaking on the opening day of an Asia Pacific inter-governmental meeting on HIV and AIDS in Bangkok.  . UNAIDS announced a five-year, fast-track approach in November that it said could effectively end the worldwide health threat posed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2030.  . HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years by taking cocktails of antiretroviral drugs (ARV). . The Asia-Pacific region, where almost 5 million people are living with HIV, has the potential to achieve the 2030 goal, Sidibé said.  . New HIV infections in the region have fallen by 25 percent since 2001, AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 27 percent since 2005 and 1.56 million people now receive lifesaving ARV drugs. . However, the persistent underfunding of certain programs, the low rate of takeup of ARV drugs and policy barriers threaten these gains, he said. . Less than 8 percent of HIV prevention programs in the region are focused on “key populations” - men who have sex with men, sex workers and people who inject drugs - and that is where the epidemic is concentrated, Sidibé said.  . Governments tend to see these groups as marginal and lacking political capital and ignore their needs, he said.  . Yet looking after them would benefit the whole of society, as this would prevent the epidemic from spreading to the general population via partners of drug users, sex workers and gay men.  . “We need to show that it’s not just about those groups. That if it is not contained, it could spread.” . “The Asian (HIV) epidemic is today more concentrated than at any other moment in history,” Sidibe said.  . The Asia-Pacific region will “never control the epidemic” as long as 92 percent of funding for HIV prevention programs target the general population, he added.  . He also noted that only 33 percent of people living with HIV in the region are receiving treatment, even though India, an Asian nation, is one of the largest producers of generic ARV drugs.  . “This should be the first region that could have universal access to treatment, given that it is an innovation and technological as well as economic hub,” he said.  . Sidibé also said the legal environment in the region is often hostile to people living with HIV and has discouraged them from seeking help.  . According to UNAIDS, all 38 countries in the region have laws that make it hard to tackle HIV, ranging from criminalization of sex work and same-sex relations to compulsory detention centers for drug users.  . “I’m convinced that we will make a lot of progress in the next 15 years in terms of innovation,” Sidibé said. . “What will stop us from getting there are elements not necessarily linked to innovation because AIDS is more complex. It’s about sexuality, behavior, relationships and emotions.” |Wed Jan 28 13:22:04 +0000 2015||Asia needs more cash, campaigns, law changes to end HIV epidemic: U.N. |5.604275891108659e+17|http://reut.rs/1EPbcTi

Sharon Begley|NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s plan to put the United States at the forefront of individually tailored medical treatment should give a much-needed boost to research in the field but experts say it won’t work without reforms to healthcare, including drug testing and insurance. . The administration is expected to give the first details this week on the “precision medicine” initiative that Obama announced in his Jan. 20 State of the Union address. Obama said he wanted the United States to “lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.” . Precision medicine seeks to identify and treat the exact form of disease in patients based on their genome - the precise order of molecules in their DNA - as well as other factors such as the interaction of genes and environment, and the microbes in their body. . Rather than the current one-size-fits-all approach, drugs would be tailored to individuals, allowing doctors to target the precise form a disease takes in any individual and avoid administering drugs that may be ineffective or even harmful. . “We’d be able to make diagnoses and treatment calls at the level of the individual. We are very, very far from doing that, but the payoff would be fantastic,” said biologist Keith Yamamoto, vice chancellor of research at the University of California, San Francisco, medical school. . If Obama’s initiative is to work, a first step is to build a national database of genetic profiles so researchers can look for correlations with their medical histories.  . A 2011 report from a panel of the National Academy of Science recommended collecting molecular data on millions of patients. It also called for a type-2 diabetes project to identify the amino acids in the blood of people who develop the disease, and assess how pre-diabetes becomes full-fledged. . Nearly four years later, neither study is under way. . Obama’s initiative could breathe life into them, said two panel members who asked not to be identified. . Precision medicine has been propelled by advances in two areas in particular: cancer and pharmacogenomics, the study of how DNA interacts with drugs. Research has found that diseases such as breast cancer and lung cancer are not monolithic; they can be driven by a variety of genetic mutations. . Among the larger companies in genome sequencing which could benefit from Obama’s initiative are Illumina Inc, which this month agreed an alliance with defense giant Lockheed Martin on genomics development; Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Life Technologies unit and Roche Holding AG, which in January paid $1 billion for a majority stake in Foundation Medicine Inc, a leader in sequencing genes in tumors. . Google Inc and IBM Corp are among big firms that could play a role in storing and interpreting electronic health records and genomic and other data. . “The field has a tremendous need to crunch data and turn it into useful information,” said Lynn Etheredge, director of the Rapid Learning Project, which aims to harness electronic health records and other data to improve medical care. . One barrier to change is that government and private health insurance does not routinely cover genetic testing. . The federal Medicare program, for instance, declined in 2009 to cover a routine genetic test to predict how a patient’s cancer would respond to anti-clotting drug Warfarin. . But overall healthcare costs could be reduced by genetics because “insurers could stop paying for drugs that don’t help people,” said UCSF’s Yamamoto.  . To make precision medicine mainstream, regulators would have to change how they review and approve drugs. In the current system, the Food and Drug Administration specifies a condition for which a drug can be marketed. Insurance companies as well as government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid almost never pay for other uses. . With precision medicine, conditions would be classified far more specifically - for example, as a cancer driven by a certain gene mutation rather than simply “breast cancer.”  . “I can see the administration telling FDA and Medicare to create systems for approving and paying for drugs on the basis of molecular biology,” said Etheredge. |Wed Jan 28 06:25:23 +0000 2015||Obama's 'precision medicine' plan to boost research, but faces hurdles |5.603227301267661e+17|http://reut.rs/1EOxK6B
|(Reuters) - Medical device maker Abiomed Inc (. ) raised its full-year revenue forecast and said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved its heart pump, sending its stock up about 30 percent in extended trading. . Abiomed’s heart pump, Impella RP, helps blood circulation for up to 14 days in patients who develop acute right heart failure following implantation, myocardial infarction, heart transplant or open-heart surgery. . The device is the first percutaneous, single access pump approved for right heart support, the company said. . In surgery, ‘percutaneous’ pertains to any procedure that allows access to internal organs via a needle-puncture of the skin, rather than by using an “open” approach where organs must be exposed, typically using a scalpel. . The approval comes in the form of a humanitarian device exemption (HDE), given for devices to treat rare conditions, affecting less than 4,000 people in the United States per year, and ones which have no comparable products. . The decision comes about 6 weeks earlier than expected, and the device will likely address upwards of 8,000 patients, Leerink Swann analysts wrote in a note. . The FDA, on Tuesday, asked the company to conduct two post-approval studies to evaluate Impella RP’s safety and benefit profile. . Higher sales of other Impella devices helped Abiomed post better-than-expected revenue for the third-quarter ending Dec. 31. . The company’s revenue rose 34 percent to $62 million, well ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $53.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. . Abiomed also raised its revenue forecast for the year ending March 31 to $223-$226 million from $209-$212 million.  . Analysts on average expect $211.4 million. . It hiked its operating margin estimate for the year to 9-11 percent from 1-4 percent. .

Alex Dobuzinskis|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Doctors for student health centers at 10 University of California campuses staged a rare one-day strike on Tuesday, upset that administrators have failed to give their union information the physicians said they needed to negotiate their first contract. . The Union of American Physicians and Dentists, their collective bargaining organization, said it marked the first time in 25 years that licensed medical doctors had gone on strike in the United States.  . Physicians for the student health centers formed a union in November 2013 and have been in talks since then aimed at reaching their first contract.  . Dr. Charles McDaniel, a psychiatrist at the UCLA center and a spokesman for the group, said the UC administration has dragged its feet in furnishing basic information needed for the talks such as details on discretionary budgets of the university chancellors and a breakdown of how student fees are spent. . “We asked them for the information and we get stonewalled,” he said, speaking by phone from a picket line at UCLA. . The union rank-and-file consists of roughly 150 health professionals who work at student health centers at all 10 UC schools, providing services such as flu shots, emergency care and counseling, McDaniel said. . The bargaining group does not represent physicians for large hospitals that serve the general public at several of the university system’s campuses, so those big medical centers and their emergency care are unaffected by the job action. . Administrators at the 10-campus health centers are also licensed doctors, and they were available to provide emergency care to any student needing it, union and UC officials said. . The health center physicians plan to return to work on Wednesday, but McDaniel said more work stoppages were possible in the future. . UC spokeswoman Shelly Meron said that university officials had advance notice of the strike and rescheduled appointments that were not urgent. . “We see this as a hasty strike that is simply a negotiating tool,” Meron said. “We don’t believe the issues warrant a strike that impacts students.” . The campus health center physicians are paid on average $150,000 a year, she said. |Wed Jan 28 00:20:47 +0000 2015||University of California on-campus doctors stage rare strike |5.6023097631678464e+17|http://reut.rs/1EOcApi
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – Trouble sleeping, especially trouble falling asleep, may be associated with high blood pressure, according to a new study from China. . This is the first study to show that certain people with insomnia are at risk for high blood pressure, said coauthors Dr. Xiangdong Tang of Sichuan University in China and Dr. Alexandros N. Vgontzas of Penn State University College of Medicine, in a statement to Reuters Health. . Insomnia with increased alertness during the day, or hyperarousal, is associated with increased chronic secretion of stress hormones like cortisol, which may lead to hypertension, they wrote. . The authors studied about 300 adults, including more than 200 chronic insomniacs who’d had trouble sleeping for at least six months. They all spent one night in the Sleep Medicine Center of West China Hospital and took a sleepiness/alertness test the following day. . At night, they were allowed to sleep as they normally would, in sound, light and temperature-controlled rooms. The next day, they were given four 20-minute nap opportunities throughout the day. Researchers measured their “sleep latency,” that is, the amount of time it took for the nappers to actually fall asleep, if they were able. . Researchers also took their blood pressure readings in the evening and in the morning.  . Normal sleepers were no more likely to have high blood pressure even if they took longer to fall asleep for a nap. . For chronic insomniacs, the longer it took to fall asleep when they tried to nap during the day, the more likely they were to have high blood pressure, even after accounting for age, gender, weight and height, diabetes, and use of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine. . Compared to normal sleepers who fell asleep quickly, people with insomnia who took more than 14 minutes to fall asleep during the day were three times as likely to have high blood pressure readings or a doctor’s diagnosis of hypertension, the authors report in the journal Hypertension.  . People who fell asleep in less than 14 minutes, regardless of whether or not they had insomnia, had no increased risk of high blood pressure. . About half of insomniacs and a third of the normal sleepers took more than 14 minutes to fall asleep during the day, Tang and Vgontzas wrote in the statement. . People who have trouble sleeping should ask their doctors about their blood pressure readings, they wrote. . “Insomniacs who have either short sleep at night or show signs of hyperalertness during the day are at risk for hypertension,” they wrote. “This is similar to someone who has other risk factors such as obesity, high lipids, smoking, etc.” . The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for high blood pressure for all adults over the age of 18 every year or so, regardless of sleep patterns, USPSTF chair Dr. Michael LeFevre noted in an email to Reuters Health. . Blood pressure screening causes few major harms, LeFevre said.  . “However, many people who have high blood pressure in (a doctor’s) office setting do not have sustained high blood pressure outside of a medical setting,” he said. “Making the diagnosis of hypertension based only on office readings may lead to unnecessary treatment.” . Blood pressure measurements should be repeated outside the doctor’s office during the course of the day to confirm high blood pressure before diagnosing hypertension, he said. . Most people will need help from a doctor or sleep expert to start falling asleep more quickly, Tang and Vgontzas wrote. . SOURCE: .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – People with even moderately high cholesterol levels in their 30s and 40s are more likely to have heart disease later in life, according to a new study. . But many of them wouldn’t meet the criteria for treatment under guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC). . “What we found is that people with prolonged exposure to high cholesterol levels are at a much higher risk of cardiovascular events than people without that exposure,” said Michael Pencina, the study’s senior author from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. . “Many of these people would not be candidates for treatment using the new guidelines,” he said. “They may fall through the cracks.” . In 2013, the AHA and ACC issued new guidelines that said exercise and a healthy diet are the most important steps for preventing high cholesterol. Additionally, the guidelines expanded the group of people eligible for cholesterol-lowering medications, known as statins (see Reuters story of November 12, 2013 here: . ) . The guidelines say statins could be beneficial for people with known heart disease; those with a “bad” LDL cholesterol level of 190 or higher; patients with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 40 and 75; and individuals ages 40 to 75 with at least a 7.5 percent risk of developing heart disease over the next 10 years, based on new risk assessment formulas. . “What was most interesting and slightly unexpected is that the expansion is almost entirely in the age group 60 and above,” Pencina said. “That left us with the question, what about younger people?” . Using data from 1,478 adults without heart disease at age 55, the researchers found that heart disease eventually developed in about 4 percent of those who always had good cholesterol levels, 8 percent of those who’d had high cholesterol for one to 10 years and 17 percent of those with high cholesterol for 11 to 20 years. . But only one in six of the people with high cholesterol would have met the recommendations for statin use at age 40. That increased to one in three people by age 50, the researchers reported in the journal Circulation. . “We know from biology that cholesterol accumulates in the arteries over time,” Pencina said. “So the more we wait the more accumulation you have.” . Dr. Steven Nissen, who was not involved with the new study, said the new article illustrates the concerns many cardiologists have with the new guidelines. Specifically, he said the guidelines have a cut off for statin use at age 40. . “If you really think about it, the people you want to treat are people who have long-term risk early enough in life to make a difference,” said Nissen, chairman of the Robert and Suzanne Tomsich Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. . “To say don’t treat anyone younger than 40 is not sensible,” he said. “This article suggests it really isn’t sensible,” adding that it’s especially true for people with genetic conditions that increase cholesterol even earlier in life. . Pencina said he and his colleagues stopped short of suggesting wider statin use among younger people, because there needs to be long-term studies on its safety. . Statins are not free of risks; rarely, they can cause liver or muscle problems, high blood sugar, or memory issues.  . Pencina says younger people should get their cholesterol checked and establish a baseline. “You don’t have to attack it with statins – maybe you do after you’ve tried other things,” he added. “Statins should be the last resort. First see how much you can do with lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise.” . SOURCE: .

Madeline Kennedy| (This version of the Jan. 23rd story corrects name of the University of South Florida in paragraph 16) . By Madeline Kennedy . (Reuters Health) – After a school-based prevention program, European teenagers were about half as likely to attempt suicide or to feel suicidal, a new study shows. . Danuta Wasserman, a professor of psychiatry at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said the program was likely successful because students “felt that the power of mastering their feelings, coping with stress and choosing solutions was in their hands and not decided or forced by adults.” . Suicide is the third leading cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Suicide attempts are even more common, with some research suggesting that 4 to 8 percent of high school students try to kill themselves each year, the CDC says. . Those most at risk have a history of suicide attempts, mental illness or substance abuse, or a family history of mental illness and access to lethal methods. . In 10 European countries, Wasserman’s team randomly assigned 168 high schools - with more than 11,000 students overall - to provide one of three suicide prevention programs, or no program at all.  . The three programs took different approaches. One program, called Question, Persuade, and Refer, focused on training teachers and administrators to recognize kids at risk. A second, the Youth Aware of Mental Health Program, targeted all students with lectures, role-playing exercises and education about mental health and suicide risk. A third program used mental health professionals to screen at-risk pupils who were referred to them. . The researchers compared the number of suicide attempts by students as well as reports of suicidal thoughts after three months of having the programs in place, and again after a year.  . At three months, none of the programs showed a significant effect. After a year, however, schools with the Youth Aware of Mental Health program had half as many suicide attempts and reports of suicidal ideation as the comparison schools with no intervention. The other two programs showed much smaller differences from the no-intervention schools. . In schools with the Youth Aware of Mental Health program, 14 students attempted suicide over the course of the year, and 15 students reported having suicidal thoughts. In the no-intervention schools, there were 34 suicide attempts and 31 reports of suicidal thoughts. . In schools with the faculty-focused program, there were 22 suicide attempts and 29 reports of suicidal thinking among students. In the program that used screening by professionals, there were 20 suicide attempts and 22 reports of suicidal thoughts. . Dr. David Brent, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh wrote an editorial on the new study in The Lancet. He told Reuters Health that education about suicide, and early detection and treatment, are two important aspects of effective prevention programs, and the Youth Aware of Mental Health program meets both standards.  . Wasserman said the universal prevention model used in that program is effective because it offers treatment before students show outward signs of risk, and it does not stigmatize anyone. . Prediction is very difficult because so many suicide attempts are impulsive, Brent said in an email. . He said one weakness of the study is its exclusion of students who had recently attempted suicide, so it is unclear how well the programs would have worked for students at the highest risk. . Despite these reservations, Brent said he has faith in such programs and that “suicidal behavior is preventable in adolescents through a school-based intervention protocol.” . U.S. schools offer several programs that focus on suicide prevention, he said, and the University of South Florida publishes a booklet full of resources on effective school-based suicide prevention called The Guide (. ).  . Wasserman urges parents to advocate for programs like Youth Aware of Mental Health and to convince school authorities that “the health of young people is important.” . SOURCE: .

Stephanie Nebehay| (This version of the Jan. 25th story corrects name and title of U.S. speaker in 6th paragraph) . By Stephanie Nebehay . GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday it will create a contingency fund and an emergency workforce to respond quickly to crises after strong criticism of the agency’s delay in confronting the Ebola epidemic. . Director-general Dr. Margaret Chan said at an emergency meeting called to discuss the agency’s Ebola response that the outbreak showed the need to strengthen WHO’s crisis management and to streamline procedures for recruiting frontline workers. . Ebola has been “a mega crisis and it overwhelmed the capacity of WHO”, she told a news briefing. “Member states truly understand that the world does need a collective defense mechanism for global health security.” . In the past year, 21,724 Ebola cases have been reported in nine countries and 8,641 people have died, according to the WHO, which says West Africa’s outbreak is ebbing. . A resolution seeking major reforms, brought by the United States and South Africa, was adopted by consensus at the meeting of the 34-member executive board. . “The WHO we have is not the WHO we need, not the WHO we needed to respond to health emergencies of the magnitude of Ebola,” Jimmy Kolker, assistant secretary for global affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told the talks. . In the debate, U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director Tom Frieden said that political considerations often overruled technical expertise at the United Nations agency. . “We have given some structure to what we expect in May, which is far-reaching reforms,” said Frieden, referring to the WHO’s annual meeting of health ministers in May.  . Major donors welcomed agreement on the emergency fund, which a WHO committee had recommended in 2011 should contain $100 million after the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic. Chan told reporters that the figure was “a good starting point”. . Bruce Aylward, WHO assistant director-general in charge of the Ebola response, said the agency would need about a workforce of about 1,500 for such emergencies, up from 1,000 currently. . “What you see here is the potential for some of the most wide-ranging and sweeping reforms in any area of WHO that we’ve seen almost since the organization was established,” he said. . Dr. Dirk Cuypers of Belgium’s health service said on behalf of the European Union: “We need to ensure that a clear line of command for all levels of the organization is in place for emergency operations and we need a global work force ready to be deployed in a effective and timely manner.” . Ebola cases are declining in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, Chan said. “But we must maintain the momentum and guard against complacency and donor fatigue.” |Tue Jan 27 20:49:05 +0000 2015||After Ebola, WHO to set up contingency fund, develop 'surge capacity' |5.601776993781965e+17|http://reut.rs/1zV0ZFV
|(Reuters) - Laboratory testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc said on Tuesday it had signed a $520,000 agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify trends in screening, diagnosis and treatment of four strains of viral hepatitis. . Quest will provide the U.S. public health agency with analytics and access to Quest’s national database of clinical testing hepatitis data, which includes information from more than 20 billion test results. . The agreement expands on Quest’s previous efforts with the CDC on hepatitis C testing data for Baby Boomers, or individuals born between 1945 and 1965, one of the groups most exposed to the virus.  . The government in 2012 recommended that Baby Boomers be screened for hepatitis C, which can cause death. . The expanded agreement aims to identify trends in screening for hepatitis A, B, C and E and will focus on data for hepatitis B and C in pregnant women to find possible gaps that the CDC could use to target screening and treatment. . The data have been modified to protect the identity of the patients. . “If you can get people diagnosed, then the next obvious stage is to get them into care,” said Rick Pesano, medical director for infectious diseases at Quest. . Treatment for hepatitis C has changed dramatically since Gilead Sciences Inc introduced its Sovaldi drug in December of 2013 with few side effects. It has since introduced a second combination drug Harvoni and AbbVie Inc has launched a competitor that offers similar cure rates above 90 percent. |Tue Jan 27 20:22:08 +0000 2015||Quest in broad deal with CDC for hepatitis analysis |5.601709155863757e+17|http://reut.rs/1ENUjIt
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – People in nursing homes are more likely to be dehydrated than elderly people living in the community, new research suggests. . The study, involving patients admitted to hospitals in the UK, found that dehydration was more common among those who came from nursing homes. . In serious cases, dehydration can lead to high levels of sodium in the blood, a condition called hypernatremia that can increase the risk of dying in the hospital, the researchers say. . “We believe that when a hospital finds that more than a few people are admitted with a high sodium from an individual (nursing) home it should raise a warning flag,” Dr. Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the study’s senior author, told Reuters Health in an email. . People in nursing homes may be at a greater risk of dehydration, especially if they require assistance and may not drink enough fluids on their own.  . “We hope that this will highlight the importance of ensuring the older people are encouraged and supported to drink,” McKee said. . As reported in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, McKee and colleagues reviewed data on more than 21,000 patients aged 65 and over who were admitted to a hospital for the first time between 2011 and 2013. . Overall, 432 patients were admitted with high sodium levels, and 1,413 died in the hospital. . Patients from nursing homes were more than five times as likely to have high sodium levels as those who came from their own homes. . And dehydrated patients from any setting were five times more likely to die in the hospital.  . McKee said the study didn’t look for reasons why nursing home residents were more likely to be dehydrated.  . However, he said, reports have suggested that older people may avoid drinking because they fear no one will help them get to the bathroom in time, and also, some staffers may either fail to encourage them to drink or may actively withhold fluid to prevent them from wetting the bed. . Dr. Cheryl Phillips, a geriatrician and senior vice president of public policy and advocacy for LeadingAge, in Washington, D.C., said dehydration is a significant problem in nursing home patients in the UK, other European countries, the U.S. and Canada. . “Vulnerable elders are at risk for dehydration for a number of reasons,” Philips, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by phone. . Phillips explained that with aging, the thirst that drives people to drink fluids changes and they’re not as likely to get thirsty as quickly. . Both kidney disease and certain medicines can also contribute to the problem, she said. . Phillips added that dehydration can happen quickly, especially when people have a fever or diarrhea – and nursing home staff may not always be aware of how high the risk is for some of the most vulnerable seniors.  . She said having higher numbers of staff and better-trained and prepared staff can actually impact the incidence of dehydration very dramatically. . While there isn’t much data that looks strictly at staffing and dehydration, “we can interpolate because we do have data that shows that higher staffing levels lead to improved quality,” Phillips said. . “Families can be incredible eyes and ears,” she said, adding that family members who understand the nature of dehydration can also help prevent it. . She encourages family members to visit their elderly frail relatives at different times of day and make sure water is accessible and remind nursing home staff to encourage the patient to drink fluids even though they may not feel thirsty. . Philips notes that while the study found a higher risk of dehydration in nursing homes, the risk can be very high for elderly people who live at home too. . “If you have people (at home) who are completely as dependent and as vulnerable as people are typically in nursing homes, the risk of dehydration is also very high,” she said. .

|(Reuters) - More than 9.5 million people have signed up for 2015 individual health insurance on the new exchanges created under the national healthcare reform law, the U.S. government said on Tuesday, a number that surpasses its enrollment target for the year. . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it had signed up or automatically enrolled more than 7.1 million people on its HealthCare.gov website through Jan. 16. The federally run site covers 37 states. . Another 2.4 million people selected a plan or were automatically enrolled in the other 13 states plus Washington D.C., which run their own websites. That data is through Jan. 18 for California and through Jan. 17 for the District and the other states. . “The vast majority are able to lower their costs even further by getting tax credits,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. . The enrollment period for 2015 coverage opened on Nov. 15 and ends on Feb. 15.  . Burwell set a target calling for 9.1 million people to be enrolled and up to date on premium payments by the end of 2015 through private healthcare exchanges set up under Obamacare. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has predicted 12 million enrollees for 2015. . HHS did not say how many of the 9.5 million applicants had paid their premiums and become fully enrolled.  . The administration announced in April that more than 8 million people had selected 2014 plans. But by the end of last year, only 6.7 million were still enrolled.  . Eighty-seven percent of federal marketplace applicants used financial assistance in selecting a plan, according to HHS. . The administration said 35 percent of federal applicants were under 35 years of age. . Fifty-eight percent, or 4.2 million people, re-enrolled from 2014 health plans, while the remainder were first-time applicants. |Tue Jan 27 19:43:51 +0000 2015||U.S. says 9.5 million people enroll for 2015 insurance, beating goal |5.601612828429517e+17|http://reut.rs/1zUO5rq
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Kids with behavior problems became sexually active earlier than their peers, in a recent study. . Having sex early - before age 16 - increases the risk of teen pregnancy, partner violence, sexually transmitted infections and other negative health outcomes, the researchers say. . Other studies have found that behaviors like frequent opposition or rule breaking are associated with earlier age of first sexual intercourse or teenage pregnancy, said lead author S. Rachel Skinner of the University of Sydney in Australia, in email to Reuters Health. . The new study is larger and more robust, she said. . “We were able to disentangle this relationship from many other known risk factors, and demonstrate that (behavior problems are) an independent predictor of earlier age of first sexual intercourse,” Skinner said. . Her team used data from a long-term study beginning in 1989 that followed almost 3,000 Australian children and their families from birth through age 17.  . By age 17, 44 percent of boys and 50 percent of girls said they’d had intercourse.  . Overall, almost 22 percent of boys and 25 percent of girls said they started before age 16, usually around age 15. . Parents answered questions about their child’s “internalizing” behavior, like withdrawal, physical complaints, anxiety and depression, and “externalizing” behavior, like aggression and criminal behavior. . Kids with total behavioral scores high enough to be considered problematic were more likely than other kids to have sex before age 16. . High scores on externalizing behavior were associated with having sex before age 16 for both boys and girls, but internalizing behavior was related to age at first intercourse only for boys, according to results in Pediatrics.  . Bad behavior starting at age five for boys and age 10 for girls increased the likelihood of having sex before age 16 when the authors accounted for other factors like parental age, education attainment and socioeconomic status. . Researchers can only speculate about why externalizing behavior and early sexual activity would be connected, Skinner said. . “We do know that young people who display externalizing behavior are more likely to take risks, and to be sensation seekers,” she said. “They are more likely to take physical risks, for example, while riding motorbikes or skateboarding.” . Having sex earlier could be part of a pattern of risk-taking, she said. . “Delinquent behavior stems from a child not understanding or not caring about the consequences that will result,” said Patricia A. Cavazos-Rehg, assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. . Cavazos-Rehg, who was not involved in the new research, told Reuters Health by email, “It does not matter what the behavior is, if the child does not understand or care about consequences, then he or she will most certainly engage in a deviant behavior if temptation should arise. An individual with self-regulation problems as a child is on a trajectory to have these problems as a teen unless someone or something intervenes.” . For both genders, younger age of the mother, lower level of maternal education, the father of the child not living with the mother and parents who smoke or use drugs increased the risk for early sexual intercourse. . “Most of these factors are not changeable by any intervention that we know works,” Skinner said. “It is probably better for us to use our understanding of the risk factors of early (first sexual intercourse) to identify those who are vulnerable and make sure they receive support to stay at school, to have goals of a career or work after school, and to ensure they receive well designed sexual health and relationships education from a young age.” .

|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber, a ride service facing legal challenges around the world, on Tuesday released a survey showing that people are less likely to drive home after drinking alcohol after such businesses started operating in their cities. . The results of the survey, done with advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving, were based on a December poll of 807 adults in the largest U.S. cities where Uber operates. They come as Uber tries to establish solid legal footing for its service. . As Uber and rival Lyft grow, they are battling legal efforts, many led by taxi companies whose businesses are suffering because of the ride services, to keep them out of cities around the world. . Uber customers who request rides over the upcoming Super Bowl weekend, a time that traditionally sees a spike in drunk driving, can opt to donate $1 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving by typing in the code THINKANDRIDE, it said.  . MADD President Colleen Sheehey-Church said she was delighted to work with Uber. . The company also released findings that it says show that California cities where it launches its low-frills UberX service experienced a drop of 6.5 percent in drunk-driving crashes involving drivers under age 30.  . The data came from the California Highway Patrol and covered 17 California markets during 2011 to 2013, Uber said.  . Other factors, such as intensified campaigns against drunk driving, may have contributed to the numbers, Uber executive Jonathan Hall said in a phone interview. . Uber operates globally, while Lyft operates only in the United States. .

|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Indiana on Tuesday became the 28th U.S. state to agree to expand the Medicaid program for the poor under President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law, a move that will extend health coverage to 350,000 low-income state residents, the administration said. . The agreement was announced separately by the Obama administration and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a staunch Republican conservative, whose involvement could prompt other so-called red states to pursue versions of the Medicaid expansion that include market-based features favored by conservatives.    . The expansion, called Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, will begin offering coverage on Feb. 1 with conservative hallmarks including requirements that beneficiaries contribute to premiums and other costs through what state officials described as a health savings account. The program includes two benefits packages offering “plus” and “basic” coverage.  . Pence’s office said in a statement that the program also includes a co-pay for emergency room visits and will refer applicants to state job-training and job-search services.     . The federal government will pay for 100 percent of the expansion through 2016 and no less than 90 percent thereafter, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. . More than 10 million people have gained health coverage under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, many through Medicaid and federally subsidized private insurance, according to independent researchers and government officials. . Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have opted to embrace the law’s Medicaid expansion, which is designed to extend coverage to most people living near the poverty line. . The remaining 22 states, including Texas and Florida, which have huge uninsured populations, have chosen not to expand, largely due to political opposition from Republican leaders. . But some Republican-led holdouts, such as North Carolina, Wyoming and Tennessee, have been considering potential options for expansion. |Tue Jan 27 16:59:37 +0000 2015||Indiana agrees to expand Medicaid under Obamacare |5.6011994893336166e+17|http://reut.rs/1ENCHMX
Stephen Brown|BERLIN (Reuters) - International donors pledged $7.5 billion on Tuesday to immunize 300 million children in poor countries against deadly diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. . At a Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) conference in Berlin, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the British government topped the donations list at $1.55 billion and $1.5 billion respectively. . German development minister Gerd Mueller said the total reached $7.54 billion, surpassing GAVI’s target of $7.5 billion, despite a stronger dollar complicating funding efforts.  . Other major donors included the United States, Norway and Germany. China, a recipient of GAVI assistance early last decade, has now become a donor. . “It was a bold ask to world leaders but also a very compelling case,” said GAVI chairman Dagfinn Hoybraten. “In the course of five years from 2016 to 2020 we could vaccinate another 300 million children and avert 5-6 million future deaths.”  . Gates, who has donated $4 billion to GAVI since it began 15 years ago, said there had been “amazing” progress but one in 20 children still died before their fifth birthday. . “The goal for the next 15 years is to cut that in half again to get it to one in 40,” he said. . GAVI has provided vaccines to about 500 million children worldwide and saved 6-7 million lives from diseases like pneumonia, hepatitis B, diarrhea and measles, working with the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, World Bank and charities. . Michael Elliott of anti-poverty group One, calling GAVI a way for rich countries to give “an infinitesimal part of their tax money to save lives”.  . But Save the Children’s Jasmine Whitbread said the problems were still huge: “In some of the world’s poorest communities only 16 percent of children are reached by vaccines.” . GAVI funds immunization for countries that cannot afford them, using its buying power to negotiate discounts from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres argues that it should strike even tougher deals. . Pfizer has said it would cut pneumococcal vaccine prices by 6 percent for poor countries through 2025, including those that outgrow their eligibility for GAVI. GlaxoSmithKline has extended its price-freeze commitment to 10 years for countries graduating from GAVI and Sanofi will expand production of yellow fever vaccine. . But GAVI’s CEO Seth Berkley called the latest discount for  pneumococcal vaccine “small” and said he hoped new manufacturers would emerge to help bring about bigger price reductions.  |Tue Jan 27 15:25:10 +0000 2015||Gates, UK take lead in $7.5 billion pledge for children's vaccines |5.6009618263115776e+17|http://reut.rs/1ENwsZG
|ZURICH (Reuters) - Payers are likely to put pressure on drugmakers to lower the cost of cancer medicines, particularly when alternative treatments are available, the head of Novartis’ pharma division said on Tuesday.     . “I think there will be increased pressure on oncology prices,” David Epstein, head of Novartis’ pharmaceutical division told an analyst call after the company reported fourth-quarter results. . The high price of new immuno-oncology drugs which are expected to be used in combination with other medicines would make it necessary to impose a limit on costs, he said. . “I fully expect whenever a payer has good therapeutic equivalents to be able to put pressure on,” he said. . U.S. pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers. Earlier this month it said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process. |Tue Jan 27 14:44:30 +0000 2015||Novartis pharma boss expects pressure on cancer drug prices |5.600859465664676e+17|http://reut.rs/1zTIvpg
Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - When 55-year-old Connie Antoniou visits her fitness studio, the leg press knows her name.  . “The machines are programmed for my body so they take the guesswork out and I’m not worried I’ll injure myself,” said Antoniou, an Illinois realtor. “The traditional approach didn’t work for me. It just took too long.” . An increasing number of gyms are using high-tech exercise equipment that can prompt, respond and adapt to individuals in what fitness experts say may signal a future that frees clients from trying to gauge how fast, how hard or how long to work out.  . Now her trainer at The Exercise Coach fitness studio punches a code into the fitness machine, her name pops up on a screen, and a session tailored to her personal goals and strengths begins.  . Antoniou said because of the workout she is stronger and has improved her golf game with just two 20 minute sessions per week. . The Exercise Coach, a Chicago-based firm that has 30 franchises nationally, is among the gyms and fitness studios turning to responsive machines to improve workouts. . “The paradigm is shifting to workouts that are briefer, more challenging, more intense, and less frequent,” said Bryan Cygan, the founder and chief executive of The Exercise Coach. . He cited research published in the journal “Preventive Medicine” showing virtually all benefits of resistance training are likely to be obtained in two 15- to 20-minute training sessions a week. . “We take individual snapshots of customers and provide exercises that are appropriate to them,” he explained. “Then our software makes intelligent recommendations.” . The coach-led, circuit-style workouts cost up to $40 each and typically include leg curls, leg presses, multiple upper body exercises, and core work and elliptical trainers.  . Ted Vickey, senior consultant on fitness technology for the American Council on Exercise, said the big box gyms are also exploring the benefits of responsive machines.  . “The problem is that people aren’t exercising, period,” said Vickey, who is finishing a Ph.D. on the uses of technology in fitness. “I’m a fan of small steps.” . Vickey says wearable trackers are currently the most important fitness devices. He envisions a future in which fitness centers resemble fitness hubs, where clients with stored information can get professional recommendations. . “I like the fact that we can use that tech to make a change , but I want humans to make that change,” he said. “I don’t want equipment telling me what to do.” |Tue Jan 27 14:44:29 +0000 2015||Workouts get smart, streamlined with tech-personalized routines |5.6008594485517926e+17|http://reut.rs/1ENtILI
|GENEVA (Reuters) - Plague has killed 57 people out of 213 known cases in Madagascar and more deaths are feared after recent flooding forced tens of thousands of people from their homes and set rats on the run, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday. . The U.N. agency’s first update since late November, when there were 119 cases including 40 deaths, was based on new figures from the Health Ministry.  . The outbreak began in August on the Indian Ocean island, one of the world’s poorest countries, where the disease is endemic.. . The bacterial disease is mainly spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which swells the lymph node and can be treated with antibiotics, according to the WHO. . However, if the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. It is one of the most deadly infectious diseases and can kill people within 24 hours. . “Plague established a foothold in the capital city, affecting densely populated slums. This is alarming, as around 8 percent of cases progress to the lethal pneumonic form,” WHO director-general Margaret Chan said. . She said flooding from a tropical storm and a cyclone last week displaced tens of thousands of people and untold numbers of rats, “raising the risk of more rodent-borne epidemics”. . Adding to the danger, the fleas that transmit the disease from rats to humans have developed resistance to the first-line insecticide, Chan told the WHO Executive Board on Monday. . Madagascar’s president announced the replacement of eight ministers late on Sunday, including a new finance minister, after the government was dissolved earlier this month amid mounting public frustration over power cuts and social woes. |Tue Jan 27 14:01:58 +0000 2015||Plague cases rise in Madagascar, fear of more epidemics: WHO |5.6007524371767706e+17|http://reut.rs/1zTyrMX
Kate Kelland|LONDON/DAKAR (Reuters) - A recent sharp drop in new Ebola infections in West Africa is prompting scientists to wonder whether the virus may be silently immunizing some people at the same time as brutally killing their neighbors. . So-called “asymptomatic” Ebola cases - in which someone is exposed to the virus, develops antibodies, but doesn’t get sick or suffer symptoms - are hotly disputed among scientists, with some saying their existence is little more than a pipe dream. . Yet if, as some studies suggest, such cases do occur in epidemics of the deadly disease, they may be a key factor in ending outbreaks more swiftly by giving secret protection to those lucky enough to be able to bat the infection away. . “We wonder whether ‘herd immunity’ is secretly coming up - when you get a critical mass of people who are protected, because if they are asymptomatic they are then immune,” Philippe Maughan, senior operations administrator for the humanitarian branch of the European Commission, told Reuters. “The virus may be bumping into people it can’t infect any more.” . Latest World Health Organization data show new cases of infection in West Africa’s unprecedented Ebola epidemic dropping dramatically in Guinea, Sierra Leone and particularly in Liberia. . Most experts are sure the main driver is better control measures reducing direct contact with contagious patients and corpses, but there may also be other factors at work. . So-called herd immunity is a feature of many infectious diseases and can, in some cases, dampen an outbreak if enough people get asymptomatic, or “sub-clinical” cases and acquire protective antibodies. After a while, the virus - be it flu, measles, polio - can’t find non-immune people to be its hosts. . But some specialists with wide experience of disease outbreaks are highly skeptical about whether this phenomenon happens in Ebola, or whether it could affect an epidemic. . “There is some suggestion there may be cases that are less severe... and there may even be some that are asymptomatic,” said David Heymann, an infectious disease expert and head of global health security at Chatham House. . “But herd immunity is just the wrong term. There could be household immunity developing, but even that is only hypothesis.” . Others are more hopeful and are urging researchers in West Africa to seek out and test possible asymptomatic cases with a view to using the secrets of their silent immunity. . Steve Bellan of the University of Texas in the United States argues that if scientists can reliably identify asymptomatic people, they could help with disease-control tasks like caring for patients and conducting burials, reducing the number of non-immune people exposed in these risky jobs. . Bellan points to two studies in particular. One, conducted after an Ebola outbreak in Gabon in 1997, found that 71 percent of “seropositive” people - those with traces of the Ebola virus in their blood - did not have the disease. The other, published in April 2002, found 46 percent of asymptomatic close contacts of patients with Ebola were seropositive. . With the largest Ebola epidemic on record raging through three of Africa’s most under-resourced countries, scientists and medics have, understandably, focused all efforts on the sick and dying and not on testing people with no symptoms. . If they do, however, and if they were to find what Bellan and some others suspect, it could prompt a reappraisal of what jolted a relatively sudden downturn in new cases. . Some researchers say they have identified a few cases in the current outbreak with mild symptoms and low concentrations of Ebola virus in the blood. One was a Guinean student who traveled to Senegal and is not known to have infected anyone else, despite having contact with dozens of people.  . Ian MacKay, a virologist at Australia’s University of Queensland, agrees that possible sub-clinically-acquired immunity is one of many unexplored mysteries of the Ebola virus. . “One thing that this particular outbreak shows is that we really don’t know an awful lot about these kinds of infectious diseases,” he said. “We tend to think we can answer all the questions, but this is one of those things we may end up being taught by the virus itself.” |Tue Jan 27 09:11:20 +0000 2015||Scientists ask if Ebola immunizes as well as kills |5.600021047489659e+17|http://reut.rs/1zSzxsr
Patricia Reaney|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joan Rivers’ daughter filed a malpractice lawsuit on Monday against the New York medical clinic that treated her mother days before her death, saying doctors there posed for selfies with their sedated celebrity patient even as her vital signs were plunging. . Rivers, who was 81, suffered a loss of oxygen to her brain on Aug. 28 while physicians at the Yorkville Endoscopy center in Manhattan were performing procedures to examine her throat and vocal cords, and she died a week later at a New York hospital. . The lawsuit said the doctors were not adequately trained to recognize and deal with the type of emergency airway obstruction suffered by Rivers and that they failed to detect her deteriorating vital signs while she was in their care. . Moreover, the complaint says, the outpatient clinic allowed a doctor whose presence was unauthorized to twice conduct a procedure that Rivers had not consented to, a trans-nasal laryngoscopy, in which a scope is passed through sinus passages into the larynx. . It was during a repeat of that procedure, according to the lawsuit, that Rivers’ already dangerously low blood pressure and heart rate fell further as her airway became so constricted that she could no longer breathe. . Apparently unaware at that point of Rivers’ declining condition, one doctor took out his cell phone and snapped photos of himself with the doctor performing the laryngoscopy on Rivers while she was sedated, the lawsuit said. . As Rivers’ condition grew dire and doctors struggled to restore her breathing, the physician who conducted the laryngoscopy left the room because she knew she was not permitted to be there “and wanted to avoid getting caught,” the complaint alleged. It also said clinic staff were slow in calling 911 for emergency help. . The malpractice case was filed by Rivers’ only child, her daughter Melissa, in New York state Supreme Court seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. It names Yorkville, its parent company and five physicians as defendants. . “The level of medical mismanagement, incompetence, disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and frankly, almost incomprehensible,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement. . Yorkville Endoscopy declined comment on the lawsuit. . Earlier this month a government health agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, cited the Yorkville clinic for failing to follow standard protocols during its treatment of Rivers, including some lapses alleged by the lawsuit. . The clinic was given until March to correct its deficiencies or face revocation of its federal accreditation and funding. |Tue Jan 27 09:11:20 +0000 2015||New York clinic that treated comic Joan Rivers sued over her death |5.6000210290765414e+17|http://reut.rs/1ENaBkW
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Six more cases of measles have been confirmed in California following an outbreak at Disneyland that began in December, public health officials said on Monday, raising to 74 the total number of people in the state who have been infected. . Previously, 68 people in California had been confirmed to have the measles, along with 14 others elsewhere: five in Arizona, three in Utah, two in Washington state, one each in Oregon, Colorado and Nevada, and one in Mexico. . The latest tally includes 73 cases documented by the California Department of Public Health and one additional patient reported by the Ventura County Health Care Agency. . Most, but not all, of the 88 known cases of measles in California and out of state have been linked to an outbreak that is believed to have begun when an infected person, likely from out of the country, visited the Disneyland resort in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20. . Among those infected are at least five Disney employees and a student from a local high school that has ordered its unvaccinated students to stay home until Thursday. . Four patients are less than a year old and 11 others are between the ages of 1 and 4. . The outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated. . The California health department has said that unvaccinated individuals have been a factor in the outbreak, although some of the infected patients had been inoculated. . The Los Angeles Times blasted the anti-vaccination movement in an editorial last week for what it called an “ignorant and self-absorbed rejection of science.” . Homegrown measles, whose symptoms include rash and fever, was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But health officials say cases imported by travelers from overseas continue to infect unvaccinated U.S. residents.  . The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia |Tue Jan 27 01:36:38 +0000 2015||Six more measles cases reported in California after Disneyland outbreak |5.598876755333079e+17|http://reut.rs/1DcBcqu
Sharon Bernstein|SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California would ban the use of electronic cigarettes in public places and ramp up enforcement against selling them to minors under a bill introduced in the legislature on Monday. . There is growing concern about the health risks from e-cigarettes, also known as vapor cigarettes or vapes, which are not lit or smoked like their old-fashioned counterparts, but do generally release nicotine in a heated liquid. . “Whether you get people hooked on e-cigarettes or regular cigarettes, it’s nicotine addiction and it kills,” Democratic state Senator Mark Leno, who introduced the bill, said in a telephone interview. “We’re going to see hundreds of thousands of family members and friends die from e-cigarette use just like we did from traditional tobacco use.” . The bill would add e-cigarettes to the list of tobacco products regulated in the state, which already forbids smoking in workplaces, restaurants, bars and other places. It would also ramp up penalties for selling e-cigarettes, which come in such flavors as bubble gum and chocolate, to minors. . California would be the fourth U.S. state to treat them like regular cigarettes, and the 23rd to regulate e-cigarettes in some way. In California, the most populous U.S. state, 122 cities and counties have banned the use of e-cigarettes in certain public places. . Second-hand e-cigarette emissions contain cancer-causing chemicals, and could put children and others at risk if they are in proximity to users, said Kimberly Amazeen, vice president of public policy and advocacy for the American Lung Association in California.   . The bill was criticized Monday by a group calling itself the American Vaping Association, which said it would harm smokers who are trying to quit by switching to e-cigarettes, which are marketed as a safer alternative to the combustible kind because they do not flood the lungs with smoke. . “California smokers deserve truthful information about smoke-free alternatives, not hype and conjecture designed to scare them away from attempting to quit with these innovative technology products,” Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a press release. . But Leno, whose bill is backed by the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association, said the vapor released by the e-cigarettes contains carcinogens, and the nicotine in them is addictive. |Tue Jan 27 01:02:48 +0000 2015||E-cigarettes would be banned in public places under California bill |5.598791620399022e+17|http://reut.rs/1zQSr2S
Magdalena Mis|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The three West African countries worst hit by Ebola risk a “double disaster” unless a multi-million dollar plan is put in place to help their economies recover, Oxfam said on Tuesday. . In Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone people were struggling to make ends meet having seen their incomes plummet, the aid agency said. . “The world was late in waking up to the Ebola crisis, there can be no excuses for not helping to put these economies and lives back together,” Mark Goldring, Oxfam’s chief executive, said during a visit to Liberia. . He said a post-Ebola “Marshall Plan” should address three areas of urgent need: cash for families affected by the crisis, investment in jobs and support for basic services. . “People need cash in their hands now, they need good jobs to feed their families in the near future and decent health, education and other essential services,” Goldring said. . Research by Oxfam in three Liberian counties found that three in four families had seen their incomes decline, with an average income drop of 39 percent. . Coupled with a loss of income, food prices in Ebola-affected areas have risen. In Liberia, rice prices were 40 percent above the seasonal average. . As a result, some adults said they were cutting back on food in order to feed their children. Oxfam said that 60 percent of people interviewed told them they had not had enough food in the past seven days. . Liberia and Sierra Leone were two of the fastest growing economies in Africa before the Ebola crisis, but in both countries more than half of the population lived below the poverty line. . According to World Bank, since the outbreak of the disease nearly 180,000 people have lost their jobs in Sierra Leone, and half of household heads in Liberia were out of work. . “Failure to help these countries after surviving Ebola will condemn them to a double-disaster,” Goldring said. . The Ebola outbreak has claimed more than 8,600 lives since it was detected in Guinea in March, the World Health Organization said last week. It said West Africa’s outbreak is ebbing. . In the countries directly affected, the virus will result in at least $1.6 billion in lost economic growth this year or over 12 percent of their combined GDPs, according to the World Bank. . Oxfam called for an international pledging conference to discuss recovery plans backed by financial support to help rebuild lives and help crisis-affected economies recover. |Tue Jan 27 00:24:35 +0000 2015||Post-Ebola plan needed to avert 'double disaster' in West Africa: Oxfam |5.598695415480443e+17|http://reut.rs/1Dcn9kU
|NEW YORK (Reuters) - The daughter of late comedienne Joan Rivers filed a medical malpractice lawsuit on Monday against the New York outpatient clinic that treated the entertainer a week before her death last year. . Rivers, who was 81, suffered cardiac arrest during an examination of her throat and vocal cords at the Yorkville Endoscopy center on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and died a week later, on Sept. 4, at a New York hospital. . Earlier this month a government health agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, found the Yorkville facility  had fallen short of the conditions necessary to qualify for coverage as a supplier of outpatient surgical services. . The clinic was given until March to correct its deficiencies or face revocation of its federal accreditation and funding. . The malpractice lawsuit was filed by Rivers’ only child, her daughter Melissa, in New York state Supreme Court seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. . The lawsuit alleges that the Yorkville clinic failed to properly advise the elder Rivers about the risks of her treatment and acted with reckless disregard for her health and safety. |Mon Jan 26 23:05:48 +0000 2015||New York clinic that treated comic Joan Rivers sued over her death |5.598497151065989e+17|http://reut.rs/1zQqMir
|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A seller of green coffee bean supplements has agreed to stop deceptive advertising saying that the treatments help users lose weight, a claim that was made on “The Dr. Oz Show,” the Federal Trade Commission said on Monday. . The FTC charged that Lindsey Duncan, whose companies are Pure Health LLC and Genesis Today Inc, had claimed that an extract made of unroasted coffee beans would help people lose 17 pounds (7.7 kg) in 12 weeks without eating less or exercising more. . “Lindsey Duncan and his companies made millions by falsely claiming that green coffee bean supplements cause significant and rapid weight loss,” said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. . Under the FTC settlement, Duncan and his companies must pay $9 million to refund people who bought the supplements and refrain from making any weight-loss claims unless they can substantiate them with two studies. . A spokeswoman from Genesis Today said that Duncan left the company in 2014 and that the deceptive ads had stopped before the settlement was reached. . “We decided to settle with the FTC. ... It’s a no-fault settlement. We don’t admit any wrongdoing,” said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named.  . In its complaint, the FTC said “The Dr. Oz Show” - hosted by celebrity surgeon and radio show host Dr. Mehmet Oz - approached Duncan, who advertises himself as a “celebrity nutritionist,” to talk about green coffee bean extract as a weight loss aid in 2012. . The complaint said that Duncan, despite never having studied the subject, accepted the appearance request and quickly arranged for his company Pure Health to sell the supplement. . “Duncan did not disclose to ‘The Dr. Oz Show’ producer his relationship to Pure Health,” the complaint said. . On its website, “The Dr. Oz Show” said that the authors of a study on green coffee bean extract “formally retracted their study.” . But elsewhere the site touts “exciting new research (that) demonstrates that you can melt fat all over your body with green coffee bean extract.” It recommends taking 800 mg twice a day. . “The Dr. Oz Show” said in a emailed statement that it applauded the FTC for a “lengthy and thorough investigation of Lindsey Duncan and his efforts to defraud the public using our show.” . “The Dr. Oz Show will retain its eternal vigilance in vetting guests so they meet highest standards,” said the statement. |Mon Jan 26 22:00:37 +0000 2015||U.S. bans deceptive ads by green coffee weight-loss marketer |5.598333107390505e+17|http://reut.rs/1zQa3vK
|LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer is to cut the price of its pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar 13 by 6 percent to $3.10 per dose in poor countries as part of a commitment to the GAVI global vaccines alliance, the U.S. drugmaker said on Monday. . Pfizer’s move comes as GAVI holds a major funding conference in Berlin at which it hopes to raise $7.5 billion from donors to pay for increased deployment of vaccines in the developing world between 2016 and 2020. . The final amounted raised will be decided at the end of talks on Tuesday, although GAVI Chief Executive Seth Berkley said he was confident there would be enough money to immunize another 300 million children as planned.  . “We still have some moving pieces but we are certainly close and we will be able to reach the kids we wanted to reach,” he said in a telephone interview.   . GAVI, which is backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, UNICEF, donor governments and others, funds immunization programs for nations that cannot afford standard prices. . Its bulk-buying power helps it negotiate big discounts, although some have argued it should strike tougher deals on prices. Charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) last week called for the price of pneumococcal vaccines to be slashed. . Pfizer vaccine head Susan Silbermann said its decision had been months in the making and was not related to MSF’s demand. . The U.S. company’s new lower per-dose price will be extended  through 2025, even if developing countries with growing economies become too wealthy to be eligible for GAVI help. . GlaxoSmithKline also extended its price-freeze commitment to 10 years for countries graduating from GAVI support, while Sanofi promised to expand production of yellow fever vaccine to address chronic shortages.     |Mon Jan 26 21:15:31 +0000 2015||Pfizer cuts vaccine price for poor as GAVI group seeks $7.5 billion |5.598219615140741e+17|http://reut.rs/1DbGVNe
Toni Clarke|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday named Dr. Robert Califf, a top cardiologist and researcher, to oversee its drug, medical device and tobacco policy in what experts said is a coup for the FDA. . Califf was named as deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco, the most senior medical products position at the agency after the commissioner and one that has been empty for nearly two years. . “This is a great catch for the FDA,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “Dr. Califf is one of the most eminent physician-scientists of our generation, with a reputation for scientific integrity that will serve the agency well.” . Califf, 63, will take up the position at the end of February. He is currently vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at Duke University, a field focused on translating scientific advances into medical care. . Califf has run countless clinical studies, published more than 1,000 papers, served as an FDA adviser and has twice been interviewed as a potential FDA commissioner. His new appointment potentially brings him closer to that position. . “He is a guy who could very easily be FDA commissioner under any administration,” said Peter Pitts, a former associate director for external relations at the FDA and president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest. “He is one of the few candidates who could sail through the confirmation process because of his universally recognized talents.” . The appointment comes as the FDA faces a sea of challenges.  . Among them: How to ensure drug safety when many products are sourced overseas. How tightly should the agency regulate electronic cigarettes? How can it speed development new therapeutics? How should it regulate copies of biologic drugs, known as biosimilars? . Califf, who has close ties to the drug industry, said on a telephone conference call with reporters that one of his biggest priorities will be to figure out ways to streamline the clinical trial process. . He has worked on many high-profile clinical studies, including the IMPROVE-IT study examining the safety and effectiveness of Merck & Co.’s cholesterol drug Zetia. He will step away from any trials with which he is currently involved. . The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents drug companies, said in a statement that it “looks forward to working with Dr. Califf on creating an efficient and predictable regulatory system for patients.” . Califf will also focus on an initiative being promoted in Congress known as 21st Century Cures that aims to speed new therapies to the market and could shortly result in legislation.  . He is also close with Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s powerful head of pharmaceuticals. Woodcock said in an interview that the two go back 20 years to when she was an FDA reviewer and Califf was a clinical trial investigator. . “We are extremely fortunate to have him come work with us,” she said. |Mon Jan 26 20:57:26 +0000 2015||FDA names cardiologist to senior leadership position |5.598174106526761e+17|http://reut.rs/1DbCwtI
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – Kids who were raised in a Romanian institution for abandoned children have smaller heads, smaller brains, and different white matter structure than similar kids who were moved into high-quality foster care at an early age. . Even those who were moved into foster care by age two have noticeably different brains from children raised in biological families. . The findings show that the brain’s wiring “is profoundly interrupted and perturbed and changed by neglect,” said senior author Charles A. Nelson of Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. . “Some of these changes can be remediated by placement in enriched foster care,” he told Reuters Health by phone. . The Bucharest Early Intervention Project began in 2000 with 136 abandoned babies who had spent more than half of their lives in institutions, which was the standard at the time. At age two, researchers randomly selected half of the babies and arranged for them to be moved into high-quality foster homes. . Ever since then, the researchers have been comparing the kids to similar youngsters in biological families who were never institutionalized. . The institutions had high ratios of babies to caregivers, and children were confined to cribs, with little linguistic or sensory stimulation, to age two. Those babies grew up to have an average IQ of 70. . “On almost every measure we see impairments,” Nelson said. . “We were first concerned that their heads weren’t growing enough,” he said. Then they observed reductions in brain electrical activity and in gray and white matter. . For the current study, the researchers used data from magnetic resonance imaging of 69 of the kids’ brains, taken around age eight. . In analyzing the kids’ white matter “wiring,” they found significant differences in the corpus callosum and in several other areas, including the limbic circuitry and sensory processing areas, according to results in JAMA Pediatrics. . The corpus callosum allows the two halves of the brain to communicate, which is essential for language processing. Other changes may be related to problems with attention and decision-making. . Parents who adopt internationally from countries where this type of institutional orphanage exists may be taking on developmental issues as a result, said Jamie L. Hanson, a postdoctoral Fellow at the Carolina Consortium on Human Development at Duke University who is not part of the Romanian study. . He worked with a population of mostly Russian adoptees now living in Wisconsin, and even after 10 years with their adoptive families, some still face these issues, he said. . “I’ve heard a lot of parents struggle with the constellation of problems that their kids were going through, sometimes a mix of ADHD symptoms, social processing and interacting with peers,” Hanson told Reuters Health by phone.  . Nelson said, “Brain development after birth depends on experience, especially during critical periods. If experiences don’t occur during critical periods, developments don’t happen.” . “The brain expects certain experiences when we come into the world, and not just changing diapers, but investing in that kid,” he said.  . Most measures, but not all, were improved for kids moved to foster care early in life, he said. . Now at the start of their 16th year of follow-up, all of the kids put in high-quality foster homes have remained there, and all but 14 who were left in the institutions have been moved out by the government, Nelson said. . As the study progressed, Romania banned institutionalization for abandoned infants under age three. Today babies will often be reared in group homes or “social apartments” and moved into the institutions when they reach a legal age, Nelson said. . Comparing adopted and unadopted kids in orphanages is often difficult to do – the kids who were adopted may have been better off than the others in some way. But this study sent kids to foster homes randomly, making the results much more reliable, said Michael E. Behen, a clinical psychologist/neuroscientist in the Translational Imaging Center at Children’s Hospital of Michigan, who is not part of the study. . “We do find similar things for kids who are adopted to an enriched environment in the U.S. or Canada,” Behen told Reuters Health by phone. “We sort of find that over time in that adoptive environment some things seem to normalize.” . In the U.S., children are generally not raised from birth in institutions, but there are foster care situations with varying levels of neglect, and these results will be important for policy makers, Behen said. .

|(Reuters) - Pharmacy benefits manager EnvisionRx said on Monday it reached an agreement to provide its customers with Gilead Sciences Inc’s hepatitis C drugs on an exclusive basis, the latest Gilead victory in a market share battle with AbbVie over their new treatments for the liver destroying virus. . EnvisionRx said Gilead’s Sovaldi and its newer two-drug combination pill Harvoni would be available on its formulary, with other hepatitis C drugs, such as AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, allowed only as an exception in some cases. . It was not disclosed how much of a price discount EnvisionRx negotiated from Gilead to secure the agreement. . “The safety and efficacy profile of Gilead’s HCV products, coupled with the most competitive pricing in the drug class, have solidified EnvisionRx’s choice to place Gilead’s products in an exclusive and preferred formulary position,” said EnvisionRx President Dawn Sherman in a statement. . Express Scripts Holding, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) which had complained about the high cost of Gilead’s first to market treatment, fired the first shot in the hepatitis C price war days after the AbbVie rival treatment was approved. It gave Viekira Pak preference on its formulary, excluding Gilead’s drugs. . Gilead then locked up formulary exclusivity for Harvoni with CVS Health, the second largest U.S. PBM. . PBMs negotiate drug pricing for employers and health plans. Health insurers have also chosen sides after negotiating their own discount deals following the Express Scripts move. . Aetna, Anthem and Humana chose Gilead drugs as their preferred treatment, while PBM Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list. . Both treatments have demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients, although Gilead’s Harvoni involves fewer drugs than Viekira. . Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another drug, has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment. Viekira Pak  was listed at about $83,300.  . Analysts believe the companies have been providing discounts of up to 30 percent, although the specific negotiated rebates have not been disclosed. . EnvisionRx provides services for Medicare Part D plans as well as government paid or subsidized insurance through Medicaid, CHIP and individual exchange plans. |Mon Jan 26 19:49:58 +0000 2015||PBM EnvisionRx chooses Gilead hepatitis C drugs for its formulary |5.598004350544937e+17|http://reut.rs/1zPCqKm
Julie Gordon|VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Vancouver area resident has tested positive for the H7N9 avian flu virus in the first documented case of the infection in a human in North America, the Canadian government said on Monday. . The woman, who is in her 50s, had returned to Canada from China and is recovering from the illness in self-isolation, the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement. . “I want to emphasize that the risk to Canadians is very low because there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9,” Gregory Taylor, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, said at a news conference in Ottawa. . Taylor said the woman returned to Canada on Jan. 12 after visiting numerous locations in China and began to feel ill two days later on Jan. 14. . “All evidence is indicating that it is likely the individual was infected following exposure in China,” he said. “We don’t know at this time how the individual contracted the virus.” . The woman’s male travel partner, also in his 50s, has symptoms and was likely infected at the same time, although the second case has not been confirmed, health officials said. . The H7N9 virus passes between birds, but experts say there is not enough evidence to prove it passes between humans. Most cases report contact with poultry, usually in live poultry markets, the Canadian health agency said. . The virus first infected three people in China in March 2013. In 2014, it infected 453 people, killing 175 of them, according to the World Health Organization. . Two people reportedly died of the H7N9 virus in China’s coastal Fujian province earlier this month, and recent human cases have been reported in the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, and Shanghai. . The H7N9 virus has not been detected in birds in Canada. |Mon Jan 26 19:49:58 +0000 2015||Canada resident tests positive for H7N9 avian flu virus |5.598004331712512e+17|http://reut.rs/1DblD2d
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s generic version of AstraZeneca Plc’s blockbuster heartburn drug Nexium, the agency’s first such approval for the drug. . The approval comes as generic drugmakers scramble to get their versions to the market and AstraZeneca is taken to court over so-called “pay-for-delay” settlements to delay the launch of generics to protect its drug’s exclusivity. . Nexium raked in about $1.9 billion in global sales in the first half of 2014, according to AstraZeneca’s latest earnings statement. . Nexium, known chemically as esomeprazole, is a proton pump inhibitor used to reduce acid in the stomach to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). . Teva has won approval to make 20 and 40 milligram capsules of the drug for this indication, the FDA said on Monday. (. ) . Assuming Teva has exclusivity, its generic Nexium would add about 37 cents per share to profit and about 10 cents per share without exclusivity, Bernstein’s Aaron Gal wrote in a note. . Nexium is also cleared to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers associated with use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, to fight the stomach infection Helicobacter pylori, and for use in other conditions where the stomach makes too much acid. . Last month a U.S. federal court ruled it was not anticompetitive for AstraZeneca and India’s Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd to agree to delay the launch of a Nexium generic. . The plaintiffs claim the settlement gave Ranbaxy nearly $1 billion to delay the launch of its generic. . The suit originally also targeted Teva and another Indian generic drugmaker Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, who reached deals with AstraZeneca. Both settled with the plaintiffs. . In November, a U.S. court had denied Ranbaxy’s request to prevent U.S-based Endo International Plc and Dr Reddy’s from making generics after the FDA gave the duo approvals to launch their own copies. . Ranbaxy had planned to launch generic Nexium last year, but the FDA revoked its approval citing problems with the company’s manufacturing process. |Mon Jan 26 19:49:58 +0000 2015||FDA approves Teva's generic version of AstraZeneca's Nexium |5.5980043144321434e+17|http://reut.rs/1zPCsBY
|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A decline in Ebola cases in West Africa must not result in a loss of vigilance because a single new case is enough to reignite an outbreak, international medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Monday. . The downward trend of new cases in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone should be used as an opportunity to focus efforts on addressing weaknesses in the response, otherwise progress made in stemming the deadly virus would be jeopardized, it said. . “We are on the right track, but reaching zero cases will be difficult unless significant improvements are made in alerting new cases and tracing those who have been in contact with them,” Brice de la Vingne, MSF head of operations, said in a statement. . “A single new case is enough to reignite an outbreak.” . In the past week fewer than 150 cases of disease were reported, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . Sierra Leone remains hardest-hit, accounting for 117 of the 145 new confirmed cases, against 184 there the previous week and 248 the week before that, the WHO said on Thursday. . MSF said that there was almost no information sharing between the three worst-affected countries about tracing people who might have been in contact with Ebola patients. . “With people moving frequently across borders, it is essential that the surveillance teams based in each country collaborate immediately so that new cases are not imported into areas considered Ebola-free,” said de la Vingne. . MSF said that there were now just over 50 patients in its Ebola management centers across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. . It said although cases were decreasing, hot spots persisted, for example in Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown.  . On Sunday WHO said it would create a contingency fund and an emergency workforce to respond quickly to crises after criticism of the agency’s response to the Ebola epidemic. |Mon Jan 26 18:49:15 +0000 2015||Single new case can reignite Ebola outbreak if vigilance lost, says MSF |5.597851552176169e+17|http://reut.rs/1zPnUlQ
Mary Wisniewski|(Reuters) - The state of Ohio filed a lawsuit on Monday that claims Obamacare tax assessments against state and local governments for public employee health plans are unconstitutional. . The suit by Attorney General Mike DeWine involves the federal government’s power under the Affordable Care Act’s Transitional Reinsurance Program to levy taxes against health insurance companies and certain employers who offer self-insured group health plans. . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has said it is assessing this tax on state and local governments for their public employee health plans, DeWine’s office said. DeWine said this would destroy the balance of authority between the federal government and the states. . “This action simply protects a tradition as old as our republic that governments do not tax each other,” DeWine, a Republican, said in a statement about the lawsuit. . The assessment costs Ohio $5.3 million, money that could be used for education, roads and other local needs, the statement said. The state wants a refund, said Dan Tierney, a spokesman for the attorney general. . Tierney said the ACA does not include state and local governments as entities that can be taxed under the reinsurance program. . The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio, and plaintiffs include Warren County, the University of Akron and three other state universities. . An HHS representative could not comment on the pending litigation. The reinsurance program helps keep premiums affordable from year to year, according to HHS. . Republicans in Congress, some state governments and others have challenged in court all or part of the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010. . Last week, leading Republican senators introduced a bill to repeal one of Obamacare’s most unpopular provisions: the individual mandate that requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. . The mandate survived a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court challenge seeking to overturn it on constitutional grounds.|Mon Jan 26 18:35:33 +0000 2015||Ohio sues over Obamacare taxes on state, local governments |5.5978170742841754e+17|http://reut.rs/1Db50E5
David Morgan|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Monday unveiled an ambitious plan to control health costs by moving the $2.9 trillion U.S. health systems away from costly fee-for-service medicine, beginning with the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled. . By the end of 2018, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters that 50 percent of traditional Medicare’s $362 billion in annual payments would go to doctors, hospitals and other providers that participate in alternative payment models which emphasize cost containment and quality of care. . Officials, who hope to see the initiative matched by private insurers, employers and state Medicaid programs for the poor, said the move was intended to head off a resurgence in healthcare cost growth from an historically low 3.6 percent in 2013 to a projected 6.6 percent in 2020. . The administration announced its goals after Burwell met with private and public sector stakeholders including insurers, consumer and provider groups and employers Boeing Co and Verizon Communications Inc.  . Wall Street analysts said for-profit hospitals and private insurers would be well positioned to benefit from a new shift toward lower-cost care delivery.    . Groups representing doctors and hospitals said the move could mean greater flexibility for their members in determining care delivery, while consumer representatives said the unprecedented goals could boost the quality of care. . About 20 percent of traditional Medicare payments, a sum worth $72 billion, currently go to providers with cost-saving business models. The remainder are based on fee-for-service payments that reward providers for the volume of care they provide. Fee-for-service has been blamed by policymakers for promoting higher costs, mediocre care and unnecessary procedures. . The administration’s goals would be phased in by first increasing the participation of alternative care models to 30 percent of Medicare payments by the end of 2016.  . Officials described the 50 percent goal for 2018 as a “tipping point” that could help make payment reform mainstream across the U.S. health system.    . Within four years, the administration expects all but 10 percent of traditional Medicare to be linked to new quality and efficiency standards, including most of the remaining fee-for- service providers. . The government has also been experimenting with payment models that officials say have generated $417 million in savings to Medicare. But the effort could face long odds. New care models have shown limited progress in controlling costs and little evidence of being able to sustain cost savings.   |Mon Jan 26 17:46:06 +0000 2015||U.S. government unveils goal to move Medicare away from fee-for-service |5.5976925957718426e+17|http://reut.rs/1zP71Yt
Theopolis Waters|CHICAGO (Reuters) - A California turkey farm has been quarantined after confirmation of the first case of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza strain in the Pacific Northwest and in a commercial flock, the U.S. government said. . The news on Saturday came just weeks after China banned U.S. poultry after an outbreak of another strain of bird flu in the Pacific Northwest. . In the latest outbreak, Foster Farms said in a statement that it had informed the U.S. Department of Agriculture after detecting the H5N8 strain on a single turkey ranch in Stanislaus County following routine testing. . State and government labs confirmed the findings from samples submitted by Foster Farms, which had experienced a spike in bird deaths, according to the USDA. . The USDA’s policy requires that the ranch be quarantined. The agency will humanely kill or destroy the birds to prevent the spread of the disease to migratory and commercial flocks. . In 2013, California produced 13 million turkeys, according to the latest USDA data.  . The agency said H5N8 did not pose a health risk to the public, and birds from the involved flock would not enter the food system. . A few weeks ago, China had banned all imports of U.S. poultry, poultry products and eggs because of recent reports of highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza.   . The ban came after Hong Kong in late December suspended imports of certain U.S. poultry and poultry products after two separate virus strains, including H5N2 in northern pintail ducks, were identified in Whatcom County, Washington, according to the USDA. . Until now, neither virus has been found in U.S. commercial poultry, and no human cases with these viruses have been detected in the United States, Canada or internationally. . The discovery of bird flu on a commercial farm will undoubtedly cause more trade disruptions for the United States, said Rabobank analyst Don Close.  . “That is scary,” he said during a panel discussion at a commodity conference in Miami. |Mon Jan 26 17:01:04 +0000 2015||California turkey farm quarantined after bird flu detected |5.5975792857686835e+17|http://reut.rs/1zOVFDO
Will Boggs MD|(Reuters Health) – There are so many different genetic forms of autism that using the singular term, autism, is misleading, researchers say.  . “We believe a better term to use is ‘the autisms,’ or ‘the autism spectrum disorders’ (that is, plural),” Dr. Stephen W. Scherer told Reuters Health by email. “There are many different forms of autism. In other words, autism is more of a collection of different disorders that have a common clinical manifestation.” . The DNA of affected individuals varies remarkably, his team found. Two-thirds of brothers and sisters with what’s still called autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, showed different genetic changes. . Scherer, from The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is part of a team that aims to identify all the genetic changes in individuals with ASD. . In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 68 children (1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls) have an autism spectrum disorder. Recent estimates in Europe, the CDC says, are that one to two percent of children there are affected. . When Scherer’s team looked for genetic changes in the entire DNA from 85 pairs of brothers and sisters with ASD and their parents, they found an average of roughly 73 genetic changes per set of DNA — but only 36 of the 85 families (42.4 percent) had mutations that researchers could relate to genes already linked in some way to ASD.  . And when they looked at these 36 families, only one-third of the affected brothers and sisters carried the same mutation. Siblings with different mutations showed different autism symptoms, while siblings that carried the same mutations had similar autism symptoms, the researchers reported in Nature Medicine. . “This emphasizes that these kids have different forms of autism (each their own snowflake) and need to be treated in their own special way,” Scherer said. . “Now that we know some of the genes involved in the core features of autism, we have targets to develop new drugs and that is ongoing mainly in biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies,” he said. . In the meantime, he noted, “The best treatment for the core features in the autisms is actually intensive behavioral intervention. For this, for the best outcomes, you need to start early.” . To analyze DNA, the researchers used a technique called whole-genome sequencing. They added the results to the massive Autism Speaks-Google MSSNG database that will ultimately contain genomes of “10,000s of individuals with autism(s),” Scherer said.  . This will pave the way for better treatments, he believes. “In the future, once there is a suspected diagnosis of autism, the (child’s) genome will be sequenced and doctors will compare it to the MSSNG database to find out what form of autism that child has,” he said. “With this information in hand they can then better inform the family of what to do, and equally important, what not to do.”  . More information about MSSNG can be found at . . . SOURCE: .

Lawrence Hurley|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday sent three patent cases, including one dispute over Shire Plc’sLialda drug, back to a lower court for further proceedings in light of a ruling the justices issued last week. . All three cases will now be reconsidered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. . In last week’s ruling concerning a dispute over Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s Copaxone, its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug, the high court said the appeals court had used the wrong legal analysis.  . When considering the scope of patent claims construction, the appeals court must defer to a federal district judge unless there is evidence of “clear error,” the court found. . In the Shire case, the appeals court had in a March 2014 ruling thrown out a lower court decision in the company’s favor over Lialda, a drug that treats inflammatory bowel conditions. The district court had found that a competing product manufactured by Actavis Plc’s Watson unit had infringed on Shire’s patent. . The case is Shire Development LLC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-206. . The other two cases on which the high court acted were Gevo Inc v. Butamax Advanced Fuels LLC and Lighting Ballast Control LLC v. Universal Lighting Technologies Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, Nos 13-1286 and 13-1536. |Mon Jan 26 15:06:09 +0000 2015||Supreme Court sends patent cases back to appeals court |5.5972900653132595e+17|http://reut.rs/1zOtdCc
|DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal reopened on Monday its land border with Guinea, the Interior Ministry said, five months after closing transport links in August to prevent the spread of the worst outbreak on record of the deadly Ebola virus.  . Senegal had already lifted in November a ban on air and maritime traffic with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the three countries worst-affected by the epidemic of the deadly hemorrhagic fever.  . In recent weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the outbreak in West Africa appears to be ebbing as the rate of new infections has declined. In the week to Jan. 18 there were 20 new cases in Guinea, versus 45 the week before, WHO data showed. . “The decision to open the border follows meetings between Senegalese and Guinean authorities, in the course of which the important efforts made by the sister republic of Guinea to fight the Ebola virus were noted,” said a ministry statement.     . Senegal itself recorded a single case of Ebola, a student who crossed the border from Guinea, but a wider outbreak was prevented. Senegal was declared Ebola-free on Oct. 17 but said it would enforce measures to avoid any propagation of the disease. . Experts have warned against border closures and travel restrictions as a means of containing the virus. . In the past year, 21,724 Ebola cases have been reported in nine countries and 8,641 people have died, most of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the WHO. |Mon Jan 26 14:07:37 +0000 2015||Senegal reopens land border with Ebola-hit Guinea |5.597142776582144e+17|http://reut.rs/1D9QUCX
Anjali Rao  Koppala|(Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration approved Rockwell Medical Inc’s drug for treating iron loss in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis, sending the company’s shares up about 15 percent in premarket trading.  . The drug, Triferic, replaces the 5-7 mg of iron patients tend to lose during each dialysis session.  . Anemia is common in kidney disease patients, who lose iron either due to dialysis or because they are unable to produce erythropoietin, a hormone that helps in red blood cell production. . Triferic, which is added to the dialysis solution, is the first drug that allows dialysis patients to maintain target hemoglobin without the need for intravenous iron. . The drug delivers iron directly to the bone marrow, just like dietary iron, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Annabel Samimy said.  . Iron administered intravenously is less efficient as it is encased in a shell, which goes into the liver before being delivered and gets blocked by the immune system, she said.  . Samimy said she expected Triferic to hit peak sales of $200 million-$250 million in the United States. . Rockwell estimates the market for the drug at $300 million-600 million in the United States. The company pegs the global market for Triferic at more than $1 billion, with annual growth of 6-8 percent. (. ) . “(The) approval is important for the company as it will take them into a higher margin drug business ...” Samimy said. . Amag Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Feraheme, which was approved in 2009 for the same indication, is administered as an undiluted injection. . Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc is also testing its drug, Auryxia, in a late-stage trial to treat iron deficiency in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. .

Amarjyoti Borah|GUWAHATI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cases of deadly mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis have risen nearly five-fold in five years in India’s northeast Assam state as a result of warming weather and changing rainfall, health experts say. . Between 2010 and 2014, the number of annual cases rose from 154 to 744, with deaths rising from 41 to 160, according to data from the Assam health department. The disease, which in 2009 was recorded in only half of the state’s districts, now is seen in all of them. . Doctors say climate change has played a major role in the spread of the disease, which once appear largely from May to July, but now is seen as late in the year as November, as mosquitoes survive longer in warmer conditions. . Japanese encephalitis is characterized by inflammation of the brain and high fever. . “Now the temperature ... which is ideal for breeding of the Culex mosquito is present almost until October or so, and as a result of this the cases of the disease are increasing,” said Rabindra Nath Talukdar, a senior official of the Assam health department. . “Initially it was only an upper Assam disease ... but now it has also been detected in lower Assam districts, and (now) cases have been reported from all the 27 districts in Assam,” Talukdar said. . Health department officials said changes in agricultural patterns may be affecting the rise in encephalitis cases. Warmer conditions have allowed farmers to grow more crops of rice each year, which means rice paddies with standing water offer a breeding ground for mosquitoes for a larger part of each year. . “The Culex mosquito breeds on water in the agricultural land, and now since there is water on the field for several more months than before, it gives more time and space for the mosquito to breed,” Talukdar said. . Faced with a surge in Japanese encephalitis cases, the Assam government has announced measures to tackle the problem, including more careful monitoring of cases. . Assam Health Minister Nazrul Islam described the situation as “a huge concern”. . “I have asked the senior officials of the health department to monitor the situation carefully and to report to me on a regular basis,” he said. . Faced with a growing public outcry over the disease’s rapid spread, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has ordered officials of the Assam health department to develop a plan to control the disease. . Plans should include “setting up of an intensive care unit in each district hospital for treatment of emergency cases, along with laboratory testing units,” Gogoi said. . As well, “I have already asked the health department to procure laboratory testing kits for quick diagnosis of the disease, adequate vaccines and medicines for the hospitals, and also to carry out intensive fogging in the affected areas,” he said. . Civil society groups and activists have however questioned why such steps were not taken earlier. . “The data from the state health department itself shows that the disease has taken a deadly turn over the years in the state. Unfortunately the state machinery waited for the disease to go out of control, whereas it should have taken steps to control the disease much earlier,” said Sankar Prasad Rai, of the All Assam Students Union (AASU). . Several influential student groups of the state, including the All Assam Students Union and the Assam Jatiyatibadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), have staged protests over the government’s failure to control the spread of Japanese encephalitis. |Mon Jan 26 11:23:23 +0000 2015||Deadly Japanese encephalitis surges in northeast India |5.596729471627592e+17|http://reut.rs/1zNw0eE
Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday said U.S. health regulators accepted its application to review a potent  cholesterol drug on a priority basis, potentially giving it the upper hand in a fierce race with Amgen to bring a new medicine from the promising class to market. . Regeneron, which is developing the drug, alirocumab, in partnership with Sanofi, said the target date for a Food and Drug Administration approval decision was July 24, following a six-month review period. . That could put the medicine on the U.S. market a month ahead of Amgen’s rival evolocumab. Amgen was first to file its application, but received a standard 10-month review from the FDA, giving it an action date of Aug 27. . Regeneron and Sanofi, which were seen as lagging Amgen, employed an unusual strategy to catch up, purchasing a special priority review voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical for $67.5 million. . The drugs belong to a highly promising new class called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that prevents the liver from removing bad LDL cholesterol from the blood. In clinical trials, they have shown an ability to lower LDL levels by more than 50 percent. . The injectable biotech medicines are expected to be used in high-risk heart patients who are unable to tolerate statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, or those who cannot get LDL levels low enough with statins. They are expected to be expensive, with analysts forecasting annual sales of $3 billion for each of the drugs. . Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding said it was looking at the class with an eye toward negotiating a lower price from one company in exchange for priority status on its formulary for its millions of customers. Express used the strategy with new hepatitis C treatments, getting a lower price from AbbVie and excluding Gilead’s drugs. . The first company to bring a PCSK9 drug to market would not only have a period to launch the medicine without competition, but would set the price for the class. Pfizer is also working on a PCSK9 drug that will likely be third to market. . Regeneron and Sanofi submitted an application for European approval of alirocumab earlier this month. The companies have proposed the brand name Praluent for their product once approved.  |Mon Jan 26 06:37:25 +0000 2015||Regeneron/Sanofi cholesterol drug gets FDA priority review |5.5960098033842176e+17|http://reut.rs/1D8qQIl
Ransdell Pierson|NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new wave of experimental cancer drugs that directly recruit the immune system’s powerful T cells are proving to be immensely effective weapons against tumors, potentially transforming the $100 billion global market for drugs that fight the disease.  . But top oncology researchers are concerned about the two emerging technologies, citing dangers seen repeatedly in clinical trials including the potentially fatal buildup of toxic debris from killed tumor cells and damage to healthy tissue. Such side effects could block regulatory approval if they aren’t controlled, researchers and drug company executives said in interviews with Reuters. . In some trials, the two new approaches, known as CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies, have eliminated all traces of blood cancers in 40 percent to 90 percent of patients who had no remaining options. The drugs could reap annual sales in the tens of billions of dollars for their manufacturers, especially if they can also eliminate solid tumors in such terminally ill patients.  . CAR T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor T cells, are T cells that have been removed from the body and attached through genetic engineering to an antibody fragment that recognizes a specific tumor protein. T cells are an especially powerful disease-fighting kind of white blood cell. The result is a drug with the killing power of a greatly enhanced T cell, combined with the tumor-spotting ability of an antibody.  . Bispecific antibodies are a twist on conventional antibodies, Y-shaped proteins whose two arms grasp for the same protein target found on cancer cells.  . With bispecifics, one arm of the antibody typically grasps a cancer cell while the other arm takes hold of T cells, bringing the mortal enemies into contact. The T cell punches holes into the adjacent tumor cell and injects deadly enzymes. Conventional antibodies, by contrast, don’t directly recruit T cells. . “Unleashing the killing power of the T cell directly on the tumor cells allows a large increase in potency of these antibodies,” said Dr. David Scheinberg, chairman of molecular pharmacology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  . Investor excitement over these therapies have helped boost interest from companies including Amgen Inc and Roche and have fueled a jump in share prices of smaller firms such as Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics and Bluebird Bio. . “We take patients that have failed every treatment, every chemo combination, that have just two to six months to live. You give them a CAR, and within 3 to 4 weeks you can see massive tumors melting away,” said Arie Belldegrun, chief executive officer of Kite. The company went public in June and announced a partnership with Amgen earlier this month.  . CAR T cells could cost $300,000 to $500,000 per patient, if approved, making them among the world’s most expensive drugs and testing the ability of insurers to pay for them, said Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management. The hedge fund owns shares of Kite Pharma. Bispecific antibodies could command prices of $200,000 or higher, he said. . The potency of the experimental drugs comes with some dangerous potential side effects. In the killing process, inflammatory chemicals from the medicines and the tumor cells, called cytokines, are released into the bloodstream and can cause fever, low blood pressure and rapid heartbeat that can be life-threatening. . The drugs, because of their unique structure and how they work, make it harder to predict whether they will go astray, said Dr. Bindu George, team leader of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, who called CAR T drugs perhaps the most interesting new technology.  . Most CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies in development identify blood cancer cells by a specific protein, CD19, found on the surfaces of lymphomas and leukemias. Because the same protein can also be found on non-cancerous cells, the drugs can go off track and attack healthy tissues.  . “Our biggest concern would be an off-target toxicity that wasn’t expected and we didn’t know the cause of it,” George said. In that case, “we might have to ask (the drugmaker) for additional information, how the toxicity happened, what organ it was, and literally go back to the drawing board.” . Researchers have used anti-inflammation medications to tame some of the adverse reactions, not always successfully. A study of CAR T cell treatment sponsored by Juno for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was briefly put on hold after two people died. . Unlike antibodies, which are excreted from the body within days or weeks, engineered CAR T cells are expected to circulate for years or even a lifetime in the bloodstream, potentially providing lasting benefits, but also risks. . “You can start to reject normal tissues; it can kill organs or cause autoimmune disease, and you don’t want that,” said Zelig Eshhar, a professor emeritus of the Weizmann Institute in Israel who pioneered the CAR approach. . To reduce that danger, researchers are attempting to build “suicide switches” into CAR T cells to turn them off after they have wiped out all signs of cancer. . At least 30 bispecific antibodies are believed to be in development, including ones from Roche, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Eli Lilly.  . A growing number of drugmakers are also racing to develop the first CAR T therapies, including Kite, Novartis, Juno, Cellectis and its partner Pfizer Inc, and Bluebird, in partnership with Celgene Corp.  . The FDA in December approved the first bispecific, Amgen’s $178,000 Blincyto for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that did not respond to previous treatment. The cancer, prevalent in children, is diagnosed each year in an estimated 6,020 Americans, killing about a fourth of them.  . One third of patients in the Amgen study had no detectable cancer for nearly seven months after receiving the drug through a month-long infusion. . A main hope for Blincyto is that it will keep patients alive until they can receive stem cell transplants, their best chance of a possible cure. . CAR technology may also come to the rescue where few options remain. . “If doctors and specialists learn how to control this very powerful gun, CAR T cells could save hundreds of thousands of people in the United States,” said Ori Hershkowitz, a Tel Aviv-based fund manager with Sphera Funds, which owns shares of Kite and rival CARs developer Novartis. . A Novartis trial showed 27 of 30 children and adults with ALL had no signs of the disease after being treated with its CAR T drug. Some 78 percent of patients were still alive six months after treatment, while some sustained remission for up to two years. . But everyone in the study developed cytokine release syndrome, including a severe form of it in 27 percent of patients. . “It certainly needs to be watched and evaluated,” said Usman Azam, global head of cell therapies for Novartis. He still believes the drug’s benefits provide “compelling hope that you can potentially cure patients.” . Roche’s Genentech unit is conducting a mid-stage trial of a bispecific antibody to treat head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer. It is studying a dozen others in preclinical trials against cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and inflammatory diseases. . Paul Carter, a Genentech executive, was cautious about the prospects. . “It’s too early to say whether this will be a home run, although there’s optimism it will be at least a base hit that will help us figure out how to go further.”   |Mon Jan 26 06:21:40 +0000 2015||Safety concerns cloud early promise of powerful new cancer drugs |5.5959701850373734e+17|http://reut.rs/1D8ocCb
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Despite moves by some states to allow recreational and medical use of marijuana, a large group of U.S. pediatricians says in a new statement that the substance should remain – for the most part – illegal. . In an update to its 2004 position statement on the matter, the American Academy of Pediatrics also calls for decriminalization of marijuana to lessen the lasting effects of criminal charges brought against youths – especially minorities. . While it doesn’t support legalization, the Academy says the penalties for being caught with the substance should be reduced because a criminal record can have a lasting impact on people’s lives, causing them to have trouble getting jobs, housing and loans for education. . Decriminalization of marijuana “takes this whole issue out of the criminal justice system and puts it into the health system, where it really should be,” said Dr. Seth Ammerman, the statement’s lead author from Stanford University in California.  . “What that would look like - we hope – (is) if you’re found to be in possession of marijuana as a kid, instead of going to jail, juvenile hall or getting some sort of record, you’d be put in some sort of diversion or treatment program,” Ammerman told Reuters Health. . But while people often say marijuana is as benign as alcohol for adults, Ammerman said it’s the Academy’s position that the same is not true for children and adolescents. . “It’s not benign for youth,” he said. “It may be benign for adults, but the Academy feels strongly that alcohol is not benign for youths either.” . The statement says the negative effects of marijuana on adolescents are well documented, including impaired short-term memory and decreased concentration and problem solving. . Marijuana also affects motor control, which may contribute to deaths or injuries through traffic and other accidents. There are also more recent questions as to whether early use of the substance affects the brain. . “There has been some interesting brain development research that shows the brain continues to develop into the mid-20s, and there is some research in regular to heavy users that their brain development is not normal,” Ammerman said. . While the organization is opposed to the legalization of marijuana because of the potential harm to children and adolescents, it supports studies of the effects of legalization, in states where sale and possession are allowed, in order to inform future policies and reduce use among youth. . So far, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia allow recreational sale and/or possession of marijuana by adults. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia allow medical use of marijuana. . The Academy also opposes the legalization of marijuana for medical uses that haven’t been evaluated through proper regulatory channels, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  . One sticking point, according to Ammerman, is that many of the ingredients in marijuana – known as cannabinoids – have not been studied. . “There are over 200 - minimum if not more than that - and we know very little about them,” he said. “These cannabinoids can have therapeutic value, but there have been no studies in children or adolescents.” . The statement does make an exception for children with a terminal illness or debilitating disease, saying marijuana should remain an option for them. . Ammerman said the Academy also recommends that parents not use marijuana around their children. . “They really need to be careful about their use especially around their kids and understand that kids’ brains are different than adults and be good role models,” he said. .

Lisa Rapaport|(Reuters Health) - Twenty-somethings who were born prematurely are less likely to move in with a lover or have sex than their peers born at full term, Finnish researchers find. . These young adults are also less likely to consider themselves sexy. And, more of them have never moved out of their childhood home. . “Previous studies have found that individuals born preterm might be more cautious and less risk-taking than those born at full term, which might also be reflected in our findings of lower likelihood of romantic relations,” said lead study author Dr. Tuija Mannisto, a researcher and fellow in clinical chemistry with the National Institute for Health and Welfare and the Northern Finland Laboratory Centre Nordlab in Oulu, Finland, in email to Reuters Health. . Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. In the weeks immediately after birth, preemies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. Some premature infants also encounter longer term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems. . To examine the romantic prospects of preemies later in life, the researchers reviewed questionnaires completed by people born in Finland between 1985 and 1989. The average age of the study participants was about 23 years. . Overall, 149 participants had been born early preterm (less than 34 weeks gestation), 248 were born late preterm (between 34 and 37 weeks), and 356 were born at full term. . Compared to individuals who were full-term, those born late preterm were 20 percent less likely to have ever lived with a romantic partner and 24 percent less likely to have ever had sex. . The findings were similar for people born early term, though after taking other variables into account, the difference wasn’t statistically significant.   . The researchers also saw that fewer of those born early had ever moved out of their parents’ house, but that difference too was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for other factors. . Asked to rate their sexual attractiveness on a scale of zero to 10, preemies on average gave themselves a lower score. With 10 being the sexiest, full-term participants rated themselves a 6.9 on average, compared with 6.5 for late preterm individuals and 6.2 for early preterm.  . The findings show that social outcomes related to preterm birth aren’t limited to those with the most severe prematurity, and, in fact, extend to many people born even just a week a two early, the researchers note in their report in the journal Pediatrics.  . While the results may have some relevance outside of Finland, babies born there have many advantages not as widely available elsewhere.  For example, Finland has few children living in poverty and offers generous parental leave and allowances for childcare, all factors that can contribute to better outcomes for preterm infants.  . “At the end of the day, one of the best predictors of outcomes is maternal income and education and socioeconomic status,” said Dr. Kristi Watterberg, a neonatologist at the University of New Mexico who wasn’t involved in the study.  . A preemie born to a mother living in poverty in the U.S. who works multiple jobs and has no access to affordable child care is probably going to fare worse than a baby born with more advantages in Finland, she told Reuters Health.  . Still, there are several things parents can do to improve prospects for their preemie, said Watterberg, who also chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn.  . In the weeks immediately after birth, preemies can benefit from skin to skin contact, breastfeeding, and being touched in a gentle, soothing way that doesn’t overstimulate them, she said. Cooing, and mimicking their sounds and actions also helps these babies engage with the world around them and build social skills.  . Watterberg also cautioned that the Finnish study findings may not necessarily mean that preemies grow up to be unhappy adults. . “What we have seen with kids is that babies who are born preterm tend to be more risk averse and shy and more fearful,” Watterberg said. “But on the other hand, we have seen that these kids tend to grow up and develop a good life, a life the kids and their parents are happy with.” .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) - Women with breast cancer often don’t know what kind of tumors they have, a new study found. . Not knowing one’s tumor features isn’t necessarily tied to worse outcomes, but better knowledge might help women understand treatment decisions and take medications as directed, said Dr. Rachel Freedman, the study’s lead author from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. . Also, she said, cancer patients who understand the basis for their treatment are generally more satisfied with that treatment.  . “Nobody to my knowledge has asked how much knowledge someone had of their own disease,” she added. . For the new study, published in the journal Cancer, Freedman and her colleagues asked 500 women from northern California about their breast cancers, which had been diagnosed between 2010 and 2011. . Participants were asked about their tumor grade, tumor stage and whether or not their cancer feeds off the hormone estrogen or a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  . Fifty-five percent of women said they knew if their tumor fed off estrogen, and about a third said they knew their HER2 status. About a third said they knew their tumor’s grade, which is the cancer’s aggressiveness. And 82 percent of women said they knew their tumor’s stage, which is how advanced the cancer is. . Based on their medical records, only 56 percent of women reported the correct estrogen status, 58 percent reported the correct HER2 status and 57 percent reported the correct stage. Only about one in five women reported the correct grade. . Overall, only 8 percent of women correctly answered all four questions, but the lack of knowledge was more pronounced among minority women, the researchers report. . “Even though all these questions were low for all women, we did see difference by race and ethnicity,” Freedman said. . “What’s really nice about finding something like this is that it’s a modifiable problem,” Freedman said. “If you can improve education and provider awareness of this, you can do something about this in the clinic.” . Dr. Michelle Shayne of the James P. Wilmot Cancer Center at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in Rochester, New York, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health, “Breast cancer patients in general are a very savvy group of individuals.” . They “tend to read a lot and bring a lot of clippings in to their oncologist and ask a lot of questions,” she said, so the study findings surprised her. . The results show that oncologists need to tailor their discussions about cancer to individual patients as much as they tailor the treatments, she said. . Also, she said, cancer survivors should receive detailed treatment histories and information about their tumors for future medical care. . Freedman said that in her own practice, she’s been trying to explain patients’ cancers in more detail, writing down the specifics and making sure they understand the information. . “I think this raises awareness of the issue,” she said. “This may be a more important issue than we previously appreciated.” .

Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday it will create a contingency fund and an emergency workforce to respond quickly to crises after strong criticism of the agency’s delay in confronting the Ebola epidemic. . Director-general Dr. Margaret Chan said at an emergency meeting called to discuss the agency’s Ebola response that the outbreak showed the need to strengthen WHO’s crisis management and to streamline procedures for recruiting frontline workers. . Ebola has been “a mega crisis and it overwhelmed the capacity of WHO”, she told a news briefing. “Member states truly understand that the world does need a collective defence mechanism for global health security.” . In the past year, 21,724 Ebola cases have been reported in nine countries and 8,641 people have died, according to the WHO, which says West Africa’s outbreak is ebbing. . A resolution seeking major reforms, brought by the United States and South Africa, was adopted by consensus at the meeting of the 34-member executive board. . “The WHO we have is not the WHO we need, not the WHO we needed to respond to health emergencies of the magnitude of Ebola,” Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told the talks. . In the debate, he said that political considerations often overruled technical expertise at the United Nations agency. . “We have given some structure to what we expect in May, which is far-reaching reforms,” said Frieden, referring to the WHO’s annual meeting of health ministers in May.  . Major donors welcomed agreement on the emergency fund, which a WHO committee had recommended in 2011 should contain $100 million after the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic. Chan told reporters that the figure was “a good starting point”. . Bruce Aylward, WHO assistant director-general in charge of the Ebola response, said the agency would need about a workforce of about 1,500 for such emergencies, up from 1,000 currently. . “What you see here is the potential for some of the most wide-ranging and sweeping reforms in any area of WHO that we’ve seen almost since the organisation was established,” he said. . Dr. Dirk Cuypers of Belgium’s health service said on behalf of the European Union: “We need to ensure that a clear line of command for all levels of the organisation is in place for emergency operations and we need a global work force ready to be deployed in a effective and timely manner.” . Ebola cases are declining in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, Chan said. “But we must maintain the momentum and guard against complacency and donor fatigue.” |Sun Jan 25 13:44:31 +0000 2015||Ebola waning, but WHO must respond better next time, Chan says |5.593460747801846e+17|http://reut.rs/1D63mn8
|LONDON (Reuters) - A British nurse who had been critically ill with Ebola after working in Sierra Leone has been discharged from a London hospital after making a full recovery.  . Pauline Cafferkey was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in north London on Dec. 30 after falling ill on her return from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for the charity Save the Children at a treatment center outside the capital, Freetown.  . Cafferkey was the first person to have been diagnosed with Ebola on British soil. . “I am just happy to be alive,” she said in a statement released via the hospital. “I still don’t feel 100 percent, I feel quite weak, but I’m looking forward to going home. I want to say a big thank you to the staff who treated me - they were amazing.” . The Royal Free, Britain’s main center for Ebola cases, also successfully treated British aid worker William Pooley who contracted the virus in West Africa. |Sat Jan 24 19:21:34 +0000 2015||British nurse makes full recovery from Ebola |5.590685108409631e+17|http://reut.rs/1D3sfzU
Ben Hirschler|DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - A steep fall in Ebola cases in Liberia will make it hard to prove whether experimental vaccines work in a major clinical trial about to start in the country, the head of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Saturday. . The NIH might have to move some testing to neighboring Sierra Leone, while regulators could end up approving Ebola shots based on efficacy data from animal tests backed by only limited human evidence, Francis Collins told Reuters. . Liberia, once the epicenter of West Africa’s deadly Ebola epidemic, has just five remaining confirmed cases of the disease, a senior health official has said.  . The sharp decrease in cases is clearly good news, but it poses a problem for scientists from the NIH, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck, who want to enroll 27,000 people at risk of infection in the pivotal Phase III Liberian study. . “It’s going to be a hard trial,” Collins said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. “It’s possible we may have to move some of the effort to Sierra Leone, which is unfortunately in not quite such a good position as Liberia.” . The big Liberian trial, the first of several planned for West Africa, aims to enroll at-risk people such as healthcare staff, family members and burial workers. It will test a GSK vaccine, a rival one from Merck and NewLink, and a placebo. . “It may, at this point, be hard to find 27,000 people at risk,” Collins said. “It is going to be challenging.” . Nonetheless, vaccines could still be submitted to regulators using efficacy data from non-human primate experiments, plus proof of safety and immune system response in humans. . “That is the default and certainly the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has that particular pathway available. If it is not possible to get the rigorous human data, it is still possible a vaccine could be approved,” Collins said. . Healthcare experts meeting in Davos this week have stressed the need to keep up the fight against Ebola until there are zero cases in West Africa, where more than 8,600 people have died from the disease. . Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain’s Wellcome Trust health charity, said vaccines and drugs were still needed for the current epidemic and to fight future ones.   . Johnson & Johnson, working with Bavarian Nordic , also has an Ebola vaccine in earlier-stage clinical tests.     |Sat Jan 24 15:47:47 +0000 2015||Liberia Ebola vaccine trial 'challenging' as cases tumble |5.590147103483781e+17|http://reut.rs/1D2Nce7
|DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Two new tools to fight AIDS should be available by 2030 in the form of a vaccine and new intense drug treatments, ending most cases of a disease that has killed millions in the past 30 years, Bill Gates said. . The Microsoft founder, whose philanthropic foundation has poured millions of dollars into medical research, told the World Economic Forum in Davos the “two miracles” were within reach in the coming years. . “We’re pretty optimistic in this 15-year period we will get those two new tools,” Gates told a session late on Friday. . A vaccine is seen as pivotal in preventing new infections among susceptible populations, while new kinds of intense drug treatments should do away with the need for life-long pills, he said. . Gates, whose Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plays a major role in funding medical research, is also optimistic about the fight against malaria, where work on a vaccine is more advanced than for AIDS. . GlaxoSmithKline filed the world’s first malaria vaccine for approval in July last year.   . “We won’t see the end of AIDS,” Gates told the forum. “But both for malaria and AIDS we’re seeing that the tools that will let us do 95 to 100 percent reduction, those tools will be invented during this 15-year period.” . Bill and Melinda Gates predicted in their annual letter on the work of their foundation this week that the lives of people in poor countries would improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history.   |Sat Jan 24 11:58:21 +0000 2015||Gates sees 'miracle' tools for AIDS by 2030 in vaccine and drugs |5.5895696927361434e+17|http://reut.rs/1D2d1uZ
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The leading U.S. pediatrician group on Friday urged parents, schools and communities to vaccinate children against measles in the face of an outbreak that began at Disneyland in California in December and has spread to more than 80 people in seven states and Mexico. . The American Academy of Pediatrics said all children should get the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella between 12 and 15 months of age and again between 4 and 6 years old. . “A family vacation to an amusement park – or a trip to the grocery store, a football game or school – should not result in children becoming sickened by an almost 100 percent preventable disease,” Errol Alden, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. . The California Department of Public Health has reported 68 confirmed measles cases among state residents since December, most linked to an initial exposure at Disneyland or its adjacent Disney California Adventure Park. . Fourteen more cases linked to Disney parks have been reported out of state - five in Arizona, three in Utah, two in Washington state and one each in Oregon, Colorado, Nevada and Mexico.     . The outbreak is believed to have begun when an infected person, likely from out of the country, visited the resort in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20. The health department said others with measles are known to have visited Disney parks in January while infectious but did not elaborate. . Among those infected are at least five Disney employees and a student from a local high school that has ordered its unvaccinated students to stay home until Jan. 29. . The outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked theories suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated. . The Los Angeles Times blasted the anti-vaccination movement in an editorial last week for what it called an “ignorant and self-absorbed rejection of science.” . Asked if the anti-vaccination movement contributed to the latest outbreak in California, a spokesman for the state health department Carlos Villatoro, said in an email: “We think that unvaccinated individuals have been the principal factor.” . Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group calling for “informed consent” for parents regarding vaccinations, said the Disneyland outbreak had touched off a “media frenzy.” . “There’s a lot of name-calling going on rather than talking about substantive policy issues,” she said. . Homegrown measles, whose symptoms include rash and fever, was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But health officials say cases imported by travelers from overseas continue to infect unvaccinated U.S. residents. The sometimes deadly virus, which is airborne, can spread swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Sat Jan 24 00:33:35 +0000 2015||Pediatrician group urges measles vaccinations amid Disneyland outbreak |5.5878464556813926e+17|http://reut.rs/1zEGu04
Toni Clarke|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc’s drug Natpara to treat a rare hormone disorder, validating a bet by Shire Plc, which recently agreed to acquire NPS for $5.2 billion. . Natpara is designed to treat hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which the body’s parathyroid gland does not secrete enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). The hormone works with vitamin D to regulate body calcium. . Analysts expect the drug to generate peak annual sales of $542 million by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data. . The FDA approval is for patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone. It stipulates that the drug’s label include a boxed warning that bone cancer has been observed in rat studies with the drug. NPS is also required to track patient use under a risk evaluation and mitigation program. . “All of that was well known and well anticipated, so there was for us no surprises in both the label and the follow-up requirements,” said Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov. . NPS said it plans to launch sales of the drug in the second quarter of this year, but declined to comment on what the price will be. Shire’s acquisition of the company is expected to close in the first quarter.  . Shire, which makes Adderall and Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is seeking to expand its position in the field of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders and rare diseases. . About 180,000 people globally suffer from hypoparathyroidism, according to New Jersey-based NPS. In about 40 percent of cases, the condition cannot be controlled with the current treatment of high doses of calcium and vitamin D. . That uncontrolled population is the audience that NPS initially plans to target, which in the United States is about 20,000 patients, the company said. . Low levels of PTH can cause tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle spasms, fatigue, muscle aches, hair loss, dry skin, headaches, mood swings and memory problems. . Natpara is a bioengineered version of the hormone itself. . The condition can be caused by congenital disorders or surgery.  . Data from a late-stage clinical trial of Natpara showed that 53 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to reduce their calcium and vitamin D supplements by 50 percent or more, compared with 2 percent of placebo-treated patients. . NPS has filed for approval of Natpara in Europe. |Sat Jan 24 00:17:52 +0000 2015||FDA approves NPS drug, in move validating Shire takeover deal |5.587806871769784e+17|http://reut.rs/1zEE2Xf
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Children from poorer areas in the UK are less likely to be diagnosed with celiac disease - but it’s not clear why, researchers say. . “We really don’t have any information from this piece of research to say why there are differences” between children from relatively poor areas compared to those from the least deprived areas, said Laila Tata, the study’s senior author from the University of Nottingham in the UK. . Her team found roughly one new diagnosis of celiac disease for every 7,000 children living in wealthy areas, compared to about one new diagnosis for every 12,800 children living in the most deprived areas. . In celiac disease, the immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Eating foods with gluten damages the small intestine and keeps it from absorbing nutrients.  . Tata and colleagues think the likeliest explanation for their findings is that in poorer areas, children’s celiac disease is – for some reason – less likely to be noticed by doctors. . As reported in the journal Archives of Childhood Diseases, the researchers analyzed medical records from a nationally representative sample of UK children and teens, who visited doctors between 1993 and 2012. . Overall, there was about one new diagnosis of celiac disease for every 10,000 children per year, with diagnoses more common among girls. . The incidence of celiac disease increased over time, which is what other researchers have reported from other countries. . For example, the overall incidence of new cases increased from about one per 12,048 children between 1993 and 1997, to one per 6,897 children between 2008 and 2012. . While the rate of diagnosis among children younger than two years remained stable, the rate almost tripled among those ages two to 18. . Patterns have been “very similar across the world,” said Dr. Stefano Guandalini, medical director of the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center. . As for the finding that poorer children were less likely to be diagnosed with celiac disease, he said the odds of a diagnosis may be lower, but it may also be that – for some reason – children from poorer areas are somehow protected. . Guandalini, who was not involved with the new study, said researchers have suspected that breastfeeding and the timing of introduction of gluten to babies' diets played a role in the risk of developing celiac disease. Recent studies have not supported that theory, however - including one published earlier this week (see Reuters Health story of January 19, 2015 here: . ) . “We still really don’t know the reason, to be honest,” Guandalini said. “There are other factors that people have been looking at.” Those include infections early in childhood and the use of antibiotics. . “We will probably not know a clear answer to these questions for five to 10 years, but studies are there and people are working toward it,” he said. . 	In the meantime, Guandalini said, people should not start a gluten-free diet until they’ve been checked for celiac disease. “You cannot make a self diagnosis” just on the basis of feeling better by avoiding gluten, he said. .

Emma Batha|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Scientists looking for Ebola in bats have identified 16 other viruses in the animal which could jump to humans and potentially cause a disease outbreak on a similar scale to the West African crisis, a health security expert said on Friday. . Humans can contract Ebola from bats, which are carriers of the virus, as well as from other animals.  . Professor Nigel Lightfoot said the additional viruses had been identified by scientists from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa.  . “They tell me they have got 16 other (viruses)...which are just waiting to spread to humans and cause the next (epidemic),” he told a conference in London on tackling serious infectious diseases.  . “So you shouldn’t be saying if there is a next one. The message is when is the next emerging public health threat that is going to follow Ebola.” . More than 8,600 people have died in the epidemic that began in Guinea a year ago and has led to more than 21,700 cases reported across nine countries. . Lightfoot said the World Bank would shortly announce hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in infrastructure in the three countries worst affected by Ebola – Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. . The crisis has hit Liberia and Sierra Leone particularly hard because recent civil wars have left their health services in tatters, the conference hosted by think tank Royal United Services Institute heard. The conflicts also fueled a brain drain as doctors left to work in the West. . Lightfoot, who is executive director of Connecting Organisations for Regional Disease Surveillance (CORDS), an international NGO which aims to flag up potential risks, said early communication was key to preventing outbreaks turning into epidemics. . As a result of the Ebola crisis, CORDS is setting up a specialized West African network which is partly funded by the World Bank. . Lightfoot said it was vital for disease prevention specialists to work with people on the ground to build fast, smart surveillance systems.  . He said it was also important not to forget traditional healers who can play a key role in stopping Ebola and other diseases. In some places 60-70 percent of people visit healers. . In Democratic Republic of Congo, which has seen several Ebola outbreaks, health experts are teaching traditional healers how to spot patients with certain symptoms and direct them to the health system. . In addition to bats, humans can also contract Ebola from other animals such as monkeys which have come into contact with infected bats. The danger lies in exposure to infected blood in the killing and preparation of the animals. . But Lightfoot said it was pointless to tell people to stop eating monkeys which are a valuable source of protein and have been eaten for thousands of years. . “Talking to the prime minister of Guinea, he said, ‘Don’t tell my people not to eat monkeys because it doesn’t work. I know, he said, I tried to say you shouldn’t eat bush meat, bats and monkeys. It doesn’t work and people will continue to eat it’.” . Lightfoot said the answer was to minimize the risks by teaching people how to butcher animals safely and cook the meat well “so it’s monkey stew, not monkey tartare.” . He told Thomson Reuters Foundation there was no indication as to how serious the 16 newly identified viruses were. |Fri Jan 23 21:19:57 +0000 2015||Ebola experts say 16 other bat viruses could infect man |5.587359161778422e+17|http://reut.rs/1D0hfmJ
|MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia, once the epicenter of West Africa’s deadly Ebola epidemic, has just five remaining confirmed cases of the disease, a senior health official said on Friday, highlighting the country’s success in halting new infections. . The worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed more than 8,600 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Earlier this year at the height of the outbreak in Liberia, hospitals without beds for new patients were forced to turn away victims and bodies were left in the streets. . But a massive international response — including the deployment of hundreds of U.S. troops to build treatment centers — plus a public awareness campaign, contributed to a steep decline in infection rates.  . “We have five confirmed Ebola cases in Liberia as of today,” said Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah, who heads Liberia’s Ebola taskforce.  . “It means that we are going down to zero, if everything goes well, if other people don’t get sick in other places.” . Three of the remaining cases were in the capital Monrovia and the other two in Bomi and Grand Cape Mount Counties, he added.  . Nyenswah said last week that Liberia could be free of the virus by the end of next month.  |Fri Jan 23 18:31:10 +0000 2015||Just five Ebola cases left in Liberia, government says |5.5869344002922906e+17|http://reut.rs/1CZJylc
Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters Health) - After a school-based prevention program, European teenagers were about half as likely to attempt suicide or to feel suicidal, a new study shows. . Danuta Wasserman, a professor of psychiatry at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said the program was likely successful because students “felt that the power of mastering their feelings, coping with stress and choosing solutions was in their hands and not decided or forced by adults.” . Suicide is the third leading cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Suicide attempts are even more common, with some research suggesting that 4 to 8 percent of high school students try to kill themselves each year, the CDC says. . Those most at risk have a history of suicide attempts, mental illness or substance abuse, or a family history of mental illness and access to lethal methods. . In 10 European countries, Wasserman’s team randomly assigned 168 high schools - with more than 11,000 students overall - to provide one of three suicide prevention programs, or no program at all.  . The three programs took different approaches. One program, called Question, Persuade, and Refer, focused on training teachers and administrators to recognize kids at risk. A second, the Youth Aware of Mental Health Program, targeted all students with lectures, role-playing exercises and education about mental health and suicide risk. A third program used mental health professionals to screen at-risk pupils who were referred to them. . The researchers compared the number of suicide attempts by students as well as reports of suicidal thoughts after three months of having the programs in place, and again after a year.  . At three months, none of the programs showed a significant effect. After a year, however, schools with the Youth Aware of Mental Health program had half as many suicide attempts and reports of suicidal ideation as the comparison schools with no intervention. The other two programs showed much smaller differences from the no-intervention schools. . In schools with the Youth Aware of Mental Health program, 14 students attempted suicide over the course of the year, and 15 students reported having suicidal thoughts. In the no-intervention schools, there were 34 suicide attempts and 31 reports of suicidal thoughts. . In schools with the faculty-focused program, there were 22 suicide attempts and 29 reports of suicidal thinking among students. In the program that used screening by professionals, there were 20 suicide attempts and 22 reports of suicidal thoughts. . Dr. David Brent, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh wrote an editorial on the new study in The Lancet. He told Reuters Health that education about suicide, and early detection and treatment, are two important aspects of effective prevention programs, and the Youth Aware of Mental Health program meets both standards.  . Wasserman said the universal prevention model used in that program is effective because it offers treatment before students show outward signs of risk, and it does not stigmatize anyone. . Prediction is very difficult because so many suicide attempts are impulsive, Brent said in an email. . He said one weakness of the study is its exclusion of students who had recently attempted suicide, so it is unclear how well the programs would have worked for students at the highest risk. . Despite these reservations, Brent said he has faith in such programs and that “suicidal behavior is preventable in adolescents through a school-based intervention protocol.” . U.S. schools offer several programs that focus on suicide prevention, he said, and the University of Southern Florida publishes a booklet full of resources on effective school-based suicide prevention called The Guide (. ).  . Wasserman urges parents to advocate for programs like Youth Aware of Mental Health and to convince school authorities that “the health of young people is important.” . SOURCE: .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) - In a small new study, skipping the flu vaccine was associated with a higher risk for trouble with a sense of smell or taste. . Researchers say the results are preliminary, but since respiratory viruses are a common cause of a lost ability to smell, it’s possible that the flu could be a contributing factor. . Respiratory viruses can damage olfactory nerves directly and indirectly by causing inflammation. Sometimes the effect is temporary, but not always, Dr. Zara Patel and colleagues at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia write in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. . “Patients who suffer from decreased or total loss of smell, called ‘hyposmia’ or ‘anosmia’ are deeply affected by this problem,” Patel told Reuters Health by email. . “Compared to the other special senses, for example, loss of vision or hearing, the loss of smell is often thought of as relatively inconsequential, but this is far from the truth,” Patel said. . People who can’t smell may lose important safety mechanisms, such as the ability to smell smoke or spoiled food, Patel said. And 80 percent of taste is linked to smell, so a total loss of smell could ruin a person’s ability to enjoy food and beverages and have a negative effect on their social life. . “This can (and often does) lead to deep depression and a drastic reduction in quality of life,” Patel said, adding there is currently no established cure for the problem. . Patel said hundreds of different respiratory viruses might have an effect like this, including some 200 viruses that cause the common cold. But the influenza virus may be preventable with vaccines. . “I saw this as a potential opportunity to (look for) any association between rate of vaccination and rate of (olfactory) loss, and see if there’s a way to eventually use this information,” she said. . Patel and colleagues identified 36 patients with olfactory problems that started after upper respiratory infections. The average duration of loss of smell was about 19 months but ranged from three to 48 months.  . They compared those patients to 38 patients of the same race, age and gender, but without olfactory problems.  . Overall, only 19 percent of the group with smell problems had been vaccinated against the flu, compared to 42 percent of the group who had no loss of smell.  . It’s important to note this is a small study, and more research needs to be done, Patel cautioned. . Now her team needs to look at this same subject with more rigorously designed studies, she said.  . Patel said viruses aren’t the only cause of smell dysfunction - sinus disease, trauma and tumors are other potential causes.   . She said a few people will spontaneously recover their sense of smell after losing it, but this chance decreases as time passes from the first month after the loss.   . “If people realize they are not able to smell or taste as well as they used to, they should seek care from an otolaryngologist as soon as possible,” Patel said. “Because the longer the amount of time that passes before they are able to start treatment, the less chance they have for recovery.” .

Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The leading U.S. pediatrician group on Friday urged parents, schools and communities to vaccinate children against measles in the face of an outbreak that began at Disneyland in California in December and has spread to more than 50 people. . The American Academy of Pediatrics said all children should get the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella between the ages of 12 and 15 months old and again between 4 and 6 years old.  . “A family vacation to an amusement park – or a trip to the grocery store, a football game or school – should not result in children becoming sickened by an almost 100 percent preventable disease,” Errol Alden, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. . “We are fortunate to have an incredibly effective tool that can prevent our children from suffering. That is so rare in medicine,” Alden said. . The California Department of Public Health has reported 59 confirmed measles cases among state residents since December, most linked to an initial exposure at Disneyland or its adjacent Disney California Adventure Park. . Nine more cases linked to the parks were reported out of state - one in Mexico, three in Utah, two in Washington state and one each in Oregon, Colorado and Arizona. . Officials say the outbreak began when an infected person, likely from out of the country, visited the resort in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20. . Among those infected are at least five Disney employees and a student at Huntington Beach High School, some 15 miles (24 km) from the park. The school has ordered its unvaccinated students to stay home until Jan. 29. . The outbreak has renewed the debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked science suggesting a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated. . The Los Angeles Times blasted the anti-vaccination movement in an editorial last week for what the newspaper called an “ignorant and self-absorbed rejection of science.” . The percentage of children vaccinated for measles in California is slightly below the national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group calls for “informed consent” for parents regarding vaccinations, said the Disneyland outbreak had touched off a “media frenzy” around the issue. . “I think this discussion has become polarized. There’s a lot of name-calling going on rather than talking about substantive policy issues,” she said. . Homegrown measles, whose symptoms include rash and fever, was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But health officials say cases imported by travelers from overseas continue to infect unvaccinated U.S. residents. The sometimes deadly viral disease can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia.  |Fri Jan 23 16:54:34 +0000 2015||Pediatrician group urges measles vaccinations amid Disneyland outbreak |5.586691305269125e+17|http://reut.rs/1CZn0kD
Saliou Samb|CONAKRY (Reuters) - Angry residents are blocking access for health workers to dozens of remote villages in Guinea, in a sign of persistent mistrust that could threaten President Alpha Conde’s aim to eradicate Ebola from the country by early March. . The worst Ebola outbreak on record began deep in the forests of southeastern Guinea in December 2013 and has since spread to other countries in the impoverished region, killing more than 8,600 people. . Like its West African neighbors Liberia and Sierra Leone - the worst-affected nations - Guinea has recorded a sharp fall in infections in recent weeks, fuelling hope that the tide has turned against the epidemic.  . But with some people still denying the incurable disease exists, experts say it could prove difficult to trace those who had been in contact with the infected and to change traditional behavior such as burial rituals involving touching the dead. These steps are seen as vital to defeating the disease.  . “We are at a turning point. However, we cannot say that we have completely defeated the disease until we know what is happening inside these reticent villages,” said Fode Tass Sylla, spokesman for the national committee for the fight against Ebola.  . In a sign of the resistance and distrust, medical kits sent by the government to schoolchildren were destroyed by villagers in Ourekaba, southern Guinea. Sylla said that locals thought the kits had been sent to contaminate the children. . Two security officials who arrived to investigate reports of a secret Ebola burial were lynched last week by a crowd in Sinkine, in the Forecariah region about 100 km from the capital Conakry, a police source said. . While in Sierra Leone, some communities have been reluctant to change their behavior, the problem in Guinea appears more acute, with health workers still being denied access altogether.  . Health experts also worry that some of the southern areas lie dangerously close to the borders of Liberia and Sierra Leone and that imported cases could reverse some of the significant progress made in those two countries in recent weeks.  . The hemorrhagic fever, which kills roughly two-thirds of people it infects, is endemic to central Africa and had never before struck in the west, taking communities by surprise. . About 1,800 people have died from Ebola in Guinea. But in the week to Jan. 18 there were 20 new cases, versus 45 the week before, World Health Organization data showed. . Sylla said the number of patients in treatment centers had fallen sharply in recent days: there were just five in the main unit at Donka, in Conakry, and three in Gueckedou, in the remote southeast, he said. . “But we need to be vigilant because there are 36 villages that are reticent about receiving our sensitization and health agents,” Sylla said.     . The epidemic in Guinea has taken an unpredictable course. Healthcare experts believed it was ending in May, only to see it return ferociously weeks later as it emerged that locals had hidden the sick away rather than take them to treatment centers that became regarded as “death traps”. . Many villagers were appalled by attempts by officials to change their behavior - seeing it as an attack on their culture. In an effort to halt one of the main sources of transmission, authorities had banned traditional funerals. . Burials are important in West African culture, with mourners often touching the corpse in intimate, spiritual farewells to their loved ones. Ebola spreads via contact with bodily fluids of infected people or with corpses of someone killed by it. . While the United States deployed marines to Liberia to help build Ebola treatment units and Britain sent 800 troops to its former colony Sierra Leone to help battle the outbreak, France has not extended similar military aid to Guinea.  . In Guinea’s inaccessible southern forest region, far from the coastal capital and the heartland of President Conde’s Malinke ethnic group in Upper Guinea, the government is often viewed with mistrust.  . Locals here have seen little benefit from the multi-billion dollar bauxite and iron ore mining contracts that have helped make the fortunes of a small elite in Conakry.  . Tensions can spill over into violence. In September, a team of eight people trying to educate locals on the risks of Ebola were killed by a mob in southeastern Guinea.     . While case numbers are falling in Guinea, the virus continues to spread geographically. The Boffa district reported cases last week for the first time since late June. . “We are going into a phase where they need delegate to the districts and trust people in the bush to get things done,” said Philippe Maughan, senior Ebola operations manager at ECHO, the European Commission’s humanitarian aid branch. . “The end game will be tough in Guinea.” |Fri Jan 23 16:54:34 +0000 2015||Anger, mistrust in Guinea villages hinders battle to beat Ebola |5.586691288072274e+17|http://reut.rs/1zDo93e
Daniel Gaitan|(Reuters Health) - Portable X-ray services are becoming more popular as patients seek medical care in familiar surroundings.  . Proponents say-home X-ray services help frail patients avoid difficult and potentially hazardous trips to hospitals. Other patients seek in-home providers out of convenience, as an ankle or chest X-ray can take less than 20 minutes. . “We go to the patient and take the X-ray, rather than having the patient go to the doctor’s office,” said Paul Fowler, founder of Specialty Portable X-Ray, Inc. in New York.  . “Usually, in about an hour after we take an X-ray we give these results directly to the doctor,” he told Reuters Health. “With the digital X-rays, we are using probably less exposure than you would at the hospital.” . Patients must have a doctor’s prescription for an x-ray, or for an ultrasound exam, which can also be done at home. Fowler’s company charges about $300 for a visit for patients without health insurance, he said. Some celebrities seek his services to avoid paparazzi and unwanted attention. . “The very wealthy who don’t want to go to the emergency room, they feel like they’re above that, they’ll call us and say, ‘I twisted my ankle, can you come over and take an X-ray of my ankle,’ “ he added. “I’ve been doing it for 35 years, it’s just gotten bigger and better over the years.” . Jacob R. Wuerstle, president of Diagnostic X-ray Service, Inc. in Pennsylvania, said portable X-rays are also used in assisted living facilities and prisons.  . “We keep the patients in a setting that they’re familiar with, that they’re comfortable with,” he told Reuters Health. The option for home X-rays is especially helpful for elderly patients in snowy parts of the country. . His technicians scan more than 30,000 patients per year. Sessions cost about $200. “We use state-of-the-art equipment and we transmit right from the patient’s bedside to the radiologist,” he said.  . Wuerstle said baby boomers are the fastest growing segment of clients.  . Dr. James C. Carr, a professor of radiology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, believes trained technicians using portable machines can provide quality scans for patients in rural areas or unable to move.  . “As long as the equipment is being regulated and the technologists are satisfactorily trained, concerns can be mitigated,” he told Reuters Health. . But portable X-ray machines, while convenient, may be less accurate.  . Dr. David Levin, professor and chairman emeritus of the Department of Radiology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia said he would not recommend in-home X-rays for mobile patients. . “The quality of those images is usually not very good. If you compare the quality of those kinds of studies with the quality of a study that was performed in a hospital in a radiology department or in a private radiology office, there is going to be no comparison,” he told Reuters Health. “If a portable X-ray is absolutely necessary because of the patient’s clinical condition, then it’s justifiable.” . As the portable X-ray market grows, state and federal regulations for radiation protection must be followed, said Dr. William Thorwarth, Jr., chief executive officer of the American College of Radiology in Virginia.   . “You want to be very certain that the technologist who’s acquiring the images is appropriately trained and qualified,” he told Reuters Health. “There needs to be appropriate precautions so that other people in the house are not exposed.”|Fri Jan 23 16:54:34 +0000 2015||Portable X-ray services becoming more common |5.5866912667233485e+17|http://reut.rs/1CZn0kI
Jessica Dye|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for thousands of women suing Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc over transvaginal mesh devices are fighting back against the company’s claim that illegal phone solicitations may have resulted in baseless lawsuits. . Plaintiffs’ lawyers said in a court filing late Thursday there was “no evidence of fraud” tainting nearly 23,000 federal mesh injury lawsuits, which have been consolidated before U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia.  . The filing came in response to a motion last week from Johnson & Johnson asking Goodwin to allow an investigation into whether women are being illegally solicited to join mesh litigation by unknown callers, some of whom seemed to have knowledge of private medical data. The company said it was concerned the calls may have resulted in bogus claims.  . J&J has asked Goodwin to make plaintiffs offer proof they had been injured by an Ethicon device, and have their lawyers answer questions under oath about any knowledge of solicitation calls. . While strongly denouncing the “rogue call center’s shenanigans,” lead plaintiffs’ lawyers said J&J was using the calls to justify imposing unnecessary and burdensome measures that “would grind this litigation to a screeching halt.” . Lead plaintiffs’ counsel said they had raised a similar issue more than a year ago with Goodwin, after several clients told them they had received, unsolicited, a letter from a call center bearing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s logo and promising $25,000 in compensation. They turned the letter over to the judge and asked him to investigate, the filing said.  . “We thought it was improper at the time, and still do,” said plaintiffs’ lawyer Henry Garrard in an email.  . J&J could show no direct link between the calls and plaintiffs’ firms, the filing said. Furthermore, random sampling of the Ethicon cases last year showed that plaintiffs had all been implanted with mesh, although a handful had mistakenly identified the maker of their device, the filing said.  . Ethicon spokeswoman Samantha Lucas said the company was still reviewing the filing. . “Based on the reports we received, we were compelled to report these activities to the judge,” she said in a statement.  . Ethicon is one of seven companies that collectively face more than 70,000 suits before Goodwin over transvaginal mesh devices, used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Women claim the devices were defective, resulting in painful complications like infection, nerve damage and bleeding. |Fri Jan 23 16:54:33 +0000 2015||Plaintiffs’ lawyers reject J&amp;J claims of fraud in mesh lawsuits |5.58669124713599e+17|http://reut.rs/1zDo7Zj
Liisa Tuhkanen|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two weeks after floods first swept across southern Africa, tens of thousands of people urgently need clean water, food, shelter and medical care, aid agencies said on Friday, as more rain was forecast for worst-affected Malawi. . Torrential rain triggered floods in early January, affecting some 900,000 people across Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Zimbabwe, with almost 250,000 people 7forced to leave their homes, the United Nations said this week. . In Malawi, one of the world’s poorest countries with a population of 16 million, 62 people have been confirmed dead and 153 registered as missing. In neighboring Mozambique, 86 people had lost their lives, the United Nations reported on Friday.  . Aid groups said more funding was needed to provide basics such as food, and water and sanitation to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases including diarrhea, malaria and cholera. . “There are thousands of displaced families living in camps now with no food. The needs are dire. There is no water, limited sanitation facilities as parents and children share the few toilets available,” said Robert Kisyula, national director for World Vision Malawi, in a statement. . “These were unprecedented floods. They have shocked all of us: from government, to donors to the people,” he added. . The floods, the worst the region has seen in decades, have submerged wells, washed away fields and livestock, and destroyed roads and bridges making it hard for aid groups to reach the hardest-hit areas to assess needs. . Thousands of people have been trapped in remote or flooded areas, cut off from medical care and other aid. Others are staying in cramped emergency shelters, where the risk of infectious diseases is high, aid workers said. . “Water sources and latrines have been flooded and displaced people in camps do not have basic water and sanitation facilities, placing them at risk of diarrhea and malaria,” said Oxfam spokeswoman Christina Corbett. . Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said the disaster was likely to create long-term health challenges in the region where one in seven adults is HIV positive.    “Along with everything else people lost the antiretroviral drugs that they need to take every single day without fail, otherwise they risk having their health deteriorated and possibly building resistance to treatment,” Amaury Grégoire, MSF’s head of mission in Malawi, said in an emailed response to questions from the Thomson Reuters Foundation. . The U.N. World Food Programme said up to 370,000 people in Malawi need urgent food aid.  . WFP said on Friday it had started distributing high-energy biscuits to people stranded by floodwaters in southern Malawi’s Nsanje district, and aims to deliver food to 150,000 people in Malawi by the end of the week. . However, plans to scale up the emergency response have been hindered by a lack of funding, aid groups said. . The government of Malawi has said it needs $81 million to expand its emergency response and prevent further loss of life, but faces a funding gap of $67 million. . WFP said it needs $18 million to continue distributing maize, beans, vegetable oil and high-energy biscuits to survivors. |Fri Jan 23 16:38:41 +0000 2015||Dire needs of southern African flood survivors unmet two weeks on |5.586651333048648e+17|http://reut.rs/1CZjc2Q
Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - Halting the spread of Ebola in West Africa will depend on mobilising funds and aid workers before the rainy season hits in April-May, otherwise it could up to take a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Friday. . But the WHO is set to run out of cash in mid-February, a key period as it tries to halt the deadly disease, a senior WHO official said.  . “It is a programme that can stop transmission if we have the money and the people, and we don’t have either,” Dr. Bruce Aylward, WHO assistant director-general in charge of the Ebola response, told a news briefing before a special session of WHO’s Executive Board on Sunday. . The number of Ebola cases week-on-week has declined for each of the past four weeks in hard-hit Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which is promising, he said after a tour of the region.  . There has been a “real substantive reduction” in cases in the past 21 days, corresponding to the incubation period for the haemorrhagic fever, a crucial barometer for tracking its spread. . “We run out of cash in mid-February, that is four or five months before that virus is going to stop in a best-case scenario,” Aylward said. “So it is a bit of a race against time right now.” . The U.N. health agency still needs $260 million for its $350 million budget for Ebola for the next six months, Aylward said. It is seeking to raise the money from donor countries. . The key target was getting down to zero new infections. . “You’re looking at months...it really depends on the progress they can make between now and the wet season. Because if you go into a real wet season with this disease you’re looking at another hard year of work or plus.” . The rains could wash away roads, complicating logistics for aid delivery and movement of health care workers, the WHO says. . In all, 21,724 cases of Ebola have been reported in nine countries in the past year since the epidemic began in Guinea, including 8,641 deaths, the WHO said on Thursday.   . It currently deploys 700 experts in Ebola zones, but needs another 300 to help with identifying cases and tracing contacts of those who are infected, Aylward said. . “There tends to be a false sense of security that this is somehow a controllable disease. There is no such thing as Ebola control, it has got to drive to zero,” he said. . “It’s still an incredibly dangerous situation.” . The first batch of GlaxoSmithKline’s experimental Ebola vaccine has been dispatched to West Africa and is expected to arrive in Liberia later on Friday, the British drugmaker said.   |Fri Jan 23 14:48:19 +0000 2015||WHO runs low on cash for Ebola but progress key before rainy season |5.586373581540065e+17|http://reut.rs/1CYRbsh
|LONDON (Reuters) - Europe recommended seven new drugs for approval on Friday, including two antibiotics for skin infections and a new treatment option for HIV. . Regulator European Medicines Agency gave the green light to The Medicines Company’s oritavancin and Cubist Pharmaceuticals tedizolid phosphate for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. . It also recommended for approval Merck & Co’s combination of lamivudine and raltegravir for HIV, and Santen’s  ciclosporin for severe keretitis. . The Medicines Company’s drug cangrelor for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events was also recommended for approval, as was its Raplixa, a fibrinogen and thrombin powder, for improvement of haemostasis. . Novo Nordisk, the world’s biggest insulin maker, said on late Thursday it has received a positive opinion from the European regulatory authorities for its obesity treatment Saxenda.   |Fri Jan 23 13:22:54 +0000 2015||Europe recommends seven new medicines for approval |5.5861586216985395e+17|http://reut.rs/1zCLmmc
Ben Hirschler|DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The worst-ever Ebola epidemic is waning, but after ravaging three West African nations and spreading fear from Dallas to Madrid, it has hammered home the message that the world needs a better detective system for emerging diseases. . Risks posed by pandemic threats such as deadly strains of flu and drug-resistant superbugs have shot up the agenda of global security issues at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos as politicians and scientists grapple with the lessons from an Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 8,600 people. . One thing is certain: more epidemics are coming and dense urban living, coupled with modern travel, will accelerate future infectious disease outbreaks. . “Viruses do not need visas to get across borders,” said World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan, who admitted the international response in future needed to be much better co-ordinated. . Her own organization has been criticised for failing to move faster to tackle Ebola and has acknowledged that it lacked the staff and tools to fight the epidemic adequately early on. . Part of that is down to a failure to learn from the past. . After the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, a WHO review committee called for an internationally-funded “global public health reserve workforce” to be set up, as well as a contingency fund for emergencies and revamped research. . The plea was ignored at the time, but it is finally getting attention. .     “The whole world needs a new early-warning system for these diseases,” said Alpha Conde, the president of Guinea - where Ebola went undetected for three months in early 2014. .     It is not the first time a disease has been able to fester under the radar in Africa. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was missed for decades before finally bursting onto the world stage after it took hold in the United States. . In recent years, however, public fears about infections have ebbed, especially after the flu pandemic of six years ago turned out to be mild. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that humankind will be as lucky next time. . Asked to list the top infectious disease threats for the years ahead, Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said: “I think we’d all start with flu.” . But another big danger is the emergence of drug resistance to bacteria which causes diseases from tuberculosis to gonorrhoea, as well as resistance to parasites like malaria. . “Drug resistance has to be put into the same category as the emerging infectious diseases. In my view, it will be the most important emerging infectious disease in the 21st century,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity. . Being prepared for such future threats requires not only improving healthcare systems in the developing world, from city hospitals to village clinics, but also more forward thinking by scientists and drug companies. . “If we had been ready with protocols for testing new experimental drugs and vaccines when the Ebola epidemic started, we could have had a bigger impact,” said Peter Piot, one of the scientists who first identified the virus almost 40 years ago. . Despite an unprecedented scramble, clinical trials testing vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline and others in Africa are only now getting under way, just as the number of new cases drops sharply.   . One other question that needs answering is whether it is time to switch the focus from individual diseases - such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria - to improving countries’ healthcare systems as a whole. . There is little doubt that Ebola would not have taken hold on the scale it did in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea if the health systems in those countries had been stronger. . “We often talk about a disease-specific approach to the way we build systems,” said the WHO’s Chan. “No country in the world can afford to have a health system for HIV, a health system for TB, one for maternal and child health, and one for public health ... we need an integrated approach.” |Fri Jan 23 13:04:51 +0000 2015||After Ebola, flu and drug resistance top pandemic threats |5.586113167644549e+17|http://reut.rs/1zCHjq1
|ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis said on Friday its drug Jakavi has been recommended by European health regulators for wider use, boosting the sales prospects for the medicine. . European Medicines Agency (EMA) experts recommended that Jakavi — which is already approved to treat myelofibrosis, a form of blood cancer — be given the green light as a treatment for polycythemia vera, a chronic incurable blood cancer.    . Recommendations for marketing approval by the agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. |Fri Jan 23 13:04:50 +0000 2015||Novartis' Jakavi drug wins EU green light for wider use |5.5861131491518054e+17|http://reut.rs/1CYsP1Q
|LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s drug regulator said on Friday it had recommended the suspension of a number of drugs which were approved on the basis of clinical studies conducted at GVK Biosciences in Hyderabad, India. . The European Medicines Agency said the recommendation was based on findings from an inspection that raised concerns about how GVK conducted studies at the Hyderabad site on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies.  . The move follows a similar decision from state regulators in France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg in December to suspend the marketing approval of 25 generic drugs due to concerns over the quality of data from clinical trials conducted by the Indian firm.  |Fri Jan 23 13:04:49 +0000 2015||EU regulator recommends suspension of drugs over Indian data |5.58611308397228e+17|http://reut.rs/1zCHl1e
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The first batch of GlaxoSmithKline’s experimental Ebola vaccine has been dispatched to West Africa and is expected to arrive in Liberia later on Friday, the British drugmaker said. . The World Health Organization said on Thursday the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the worst in history, appears to be waning but cautioned against complacency. The epidemic has seen 21,724 cases reported in nine countries since it started in Guinea a year ago. Some 8,641 people have died.   . The shipment of an initial 300 vials of GSK vaccine will be the first to arrive in one of the three main Ebola-affected African countries, the company said in a statement. . It will be used in the first large-scale vaccine trials in coming weeks, in which healthcare workers helping to care for Ebola patients will be among the first to get it.  . Researchers hope eventually to enrol up to 30,000 people in the trial, a third of whom would get GSK’s candidate vaccine.  . The vaccine, co-developed by the National Institutes of Health in the United States and Okairos, a biotechnology firm acquired by GSK in 2013, is now being tested in phase I safety trials in Britain, the United States, Switzerland and Mali involving around 200 healthy volunteers in total. . “Initial phase I data...are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases...which will involve the vaccination of thousands of volunteers, including frontline healthcare workers,” said Moncef Slaoui, GSK’s Global Vaccines chief. . The vaccine uses a type of chimpanzee cold virus to deliver safe genetic material from the Zaire strain of Ebola, the strain responsible for the unprecedented West African epidemic. . Data show the vaccine is safe in people, including in a West African population and in a range of dose levels, GSK said. It has now chosen the most appropriate dose for the Liberia trial. . Slaoui stressed that GSK’s shot, like other candidates from a NewLink Genetics and Merck collaboration, and from Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic, remains in development and cannot be deployed unless and until it proves safe and effective. . Commenting on progress against the outbreak and on developing vaccines, Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain’s Wellcome Trust health charity, said: “This is certainly not the time for...efforts to be reduced. There is no doubt that we need vaccines and therapeutics for this epidemic and to try to prevent and respond to the inevitable future epidemics.”    |Fri Jan 23 06:28:22 +0000 2015||First GSK Ebola vaccine shipment due to arrive in Liberia |5.5851154101295514e+17|http://reut.rs/1CXfeHZ
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disneyland sought on Thursday to reassure visitors that the theme park was safe amid a measles outbreak that began there in December and prompted state health officials to urge parents not to bring their unvaccinated children. . The California Department of Public Health reported 59 confirmed measles cases among state residents since the end of December, most linked to an initial exposure at Disneyland or the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park. . Nine more cases linked to the two Disney parks were reported out of state - one in Mexico, three in Utah, two in Washington state and one each in Oregon, Colorado and Arizona.  . The outbreak is believed to have begun when an infected person visited the Anaheim resort, likely from out of the country, from Dec. 15 to Dec. 20. . Among those infected are at least five Walt Disney Co employees and a student at Huntington Beach High School, some 15 miles (24 km) from the park, which earlier this week ordered its unvaccinated students to stay home until Jan. 29.On Wednesday Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state health department, told reporters that anyone immunized for measles should have no concern about visiting the theme parks. . “But if you are unvaccinated, I would worry about it,” Chavez said. “And if you have a minor that cannot be vaccinated – under the age of 12 months, I would recommend that those children are not taken to places like Disneyland today.” . In an updated statement on Thursday, Chavez said his words of caution extended to “any place where large numbers of people congregate,” including airports and shopping malls. . Asked about Chavez’ remarks, Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown said, “We agree with what Dr. Chavez said that it is absolutely safe to visit Disneyland if you have been immunized.” She added that Disneyland attendance had been unaffected by the outbreak. . Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and resorts, has said that Disney was offering its cast members vaccinations and measles tests. . “Realistically, when you think about Disneyland, you’ll have 30,000 to 40,000 people visiting on any given day. It’s like a small city. And just like a small city it has to deal with this kind of thing,” said Jim Hill, writer of a popular blog about the company. . Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by red rash that often starts on the face and spreads downward. The sometimes deadly viral disease can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Fri Jan 23 02:25:22 +0000 2015||Disneyland seeks to reassure public amid measles outbreak |5.584503887358853e+17|http://reut.rs/1CWB0vB
Victoria Cavaliere|SEATTLE (Reuters) - A drug-resistant superbug infected 32 people at a Seattle hospital over a two-year period, with the bacteria spreading through contaminated medical scopes that had been cleaned to the manufacturer’s recommendation, officials said on Thursday. . Eleven of the patients infected at Virginia Mason Medical Center between 2012 and 2014 eventually died, the hospital and city health officials said. But those patients were critically ill before being infected and it was unclear what role, if any, the bacteria played in their deaths. . The patients were infected with drug-resistant bacteria, including the rare Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, which are difficult to treat because they have high levels of resistance to antibiotics, said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a senior official at Public Health - Seattle & King County.  . The report follows similar incidents in Pittsburgh in 2012 and Chicago in 2014, where contaminated endoscopes infected dozens of patients, health officials said. No fatalities were directly linked to the infections. . In the Seattle case, public health officials said the germs apparently spread from patient to patient by endoscopes used to treat liver and pancreatic illnesses. Duchin said the scopes are typically used for thousands of procedures each year in U.S. hospitals. . The scopes at Virginia Mason Medical Center were sterilized to existing standards before each use, public health officials and the hospital said. . “This is a national problem,” Virginia Mason Medical Center said in a statement. “We determined that the endoscope manufacturer’s, as well as the federal government’s, recommended guidelines for processing the scopes are inadequate.” . Duchin said it took investigators months to pinpoint the contamination, and the hospital has since instituted a rigorous decontamination process that exceeds national standards. . There are three major manufacturers of the scopes, called duodenoscopes: Olympus Corp, Fujifilm and Pentax. Their disinfection recommendations were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . The FDA said in a statement it was actively engaged with manufacturers and other government agencies to develop solutions to minimize patient risk. . Olympus, which supplies many of the Seattle hospital’s scopes, said in a statement it was “monitoring this issue closely.” . It was unclear how many people were exposed to the superbug, officials said. The bacteria can cause serious infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections and meningitis.  . Neither the hospital nor local health officials notified the public about the outbreak because “there was not a strong rationale for doing so,” Duchin said. |Fri Jan 23 00:59:41 +0000 2015||Superbug spread through contaminated scopes sickened dozens in Seattle |5.5842882261878784e+17|http://reut.rs/1CWjGqi
|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone’s President Ernest Bai Koroma on Thursday removed Ebola district quarantine measures intended to curb the spread of the disease, declaring “victory is in sight” after a sharp drop in transmission. . Since the worst outbreak on record began in West Africa over a year ago, Sierra Leone has recorded more than 10,340 cases, making it the country that has been hardest hit. But signs are growing that the tide is turning against the disease. . “We are now entering a transition phase. Given the progress being made against the disease, we must take action to enable economic and social recovery,” Koroma said in a televised address to the nation late on Thursday.  . Quarantine measures were previously in place in six of 14 districts in the poor nation of farmers, fishermen and diamond miners.  . Koroma, who aims to get to zero cases in the former British colony by the end of March, said that restrictions on trading hours in Freetown would also be eased. . Individual households with known Ebola contacts will remain under quarantine. . “Though victory is in sight, we must not relent, we must continue to soldier on,” Koroma said, urging people to refrain from touching the sick and the dead. Ebola spreads via contact with bodily fluids of infected people such as blood and vomit. . In the latest health report on Jan. 21, Sierra Leone reported just 9 new confirmed cases versus 60 cases daily in late 2014. Neighboring Liberia has also reported significant progress in rolling back Ebola, thanks partly to U.S. military assistance, and it is now confined to just two counties.  . But in a setback on Thursday, the mayor of Paynesville in the capital Monrovia said that 25 people had been placed under quarantine following a new confirmed case. . Guinea, where the outbreak first began 13 months ago, is still battling the disease although case numbers are thought to have stabilized.  |Thu Jan 22 23:02:33 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone lifts Ebola quarantine measures amid progress |5.583993476213842e+17|http://reut.rs/1CVW19x

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Children who had their “lazy” eye treated with an experimental mobile game continued to benefit for an entire year, according to a new study. . “Lazy” eye, known medically as amblyopia, occurs when the eye cannot clearly focus. Sometimes it’s caused by a person’s eyes being misaligned. . The usual treatment is to wear a patch over the “strong” eye, “to force the use of the amblyopic or weak eye,” said Eileen Birch, the study’s senior author. Patching the strong eye forces the brain to rely on the weak eye. . “That does work, but there’s been some research lately (suggesting) that’s not really the right approach,” said Birch, who is senior scientist at the Retina Foundation of the Southwest in Dallas. She said the condition often recurs after patching. . Additionally, Birch said, the treatment for amblyopia should also teach both eyes to work together. . For the new study, the researchers continued to follow children who were treated for amblyopia in an earlier study using an experimental game on an iPad. The game required the children to stack falling blocks while wearing glasses with lenses that are different colors. . By playing with the color and contrast settings for the game, researchers were able to require each eye to work toward stacking the blocks. Additionally, they were able to require the children’s eyes to work together. . After a few weeks, the researchers found children who used the game had improved visual acuity, which is how much detail they’re able to see. Another research team also found improvements in visual acuity among adults. . During the first study, the researchers found that the children’s improved vision remained stable for three months after they finished treatment. The new study, reported in JAMA Ophthalmology, found the improvement lasted for an entire year. . In the new study, the researchers found the improvement in vision among kids who used the game did not differ between children who used an eye patch in an attempt to make the benefits last and those who didn’t. . “The kids who had no patching afterwards did just as well as the kids who tried the maintenance patching,” Birch said. . While the app is not available to the average person, she said there is a new trial underway to test the game’s effectiveness in a much larger group of children. . “There is a lot of interest in it,” Birch said. “We’ll find out in a clinical setting whether it’s helpful for children to have this.” .

Bill Berkrot|(Reuters) - A panel of experts on Thursday voted to recommend that U.S. health regulators approve Astellas Pharma Inc’s drug for the treatment of rare, often fatal invasive fungal infections that can target patients with blood cancers. . The Anti-Infective Drugs advisory committee panel voted 11-0 that the Japanese drugmaker had demonstrated sufficient safety and efficacy to support approval of the drug, isavuconazonium to treat invasive aspergillosis. . The panel voted 8-2 with one abstention to recommend the medicine to treat invasive mucormycosis. . The Food and Drug Administration, which typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels but is not obligated to do so, is expected to make its approval decision by March 8. . “We’re extremely excited and think this medicine will address significant unmet medical needs in both of these indications,” Bernie Zeiher, Astellas’ head of global development and immunology and infectious diseases, said in a telephone interview. . In clinical trials, the drug proved at least as safe and effective in reducing mortality as voriconazole, which Pfizer sells under the brand name Vfend, the current standard of care for aspergillosis. . The Astellas medicine, which would be sold under the proposed brand name Cresemba, was granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA, which is given as incentive to develop drugs for rare diseases and comes with seven years of market exclusivity if approved. . The FDA also designated isavuconazonium as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, which provides for a priority review and a five-year extension of market exclusivity in the United States. . Invasive aspergillosis is a rare, life-threatening fungal infection seen predominantly in patients with compromised immune systems, such as those with leukemia. Mucormycosis is a very rare, rapidly progressing invasive fungal infection also with high rates of morbidity and mortality. . Panelists cited limitations of current medicines and the need for additional treatment options for the devastating infections in recommending the Astellas drug. |Thu Jan 22 20:51:59 +0000 2015||FDA panel backs Astellas drug for invasive fungal infections |5.583664869020959e+17|http://reut.rs/1CVqEMc

But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Thu Jan 22 20:15:59 +0000 2015||Disneyland seeks to reassure public amid measles outbreak |5.5835742814078566e+17|http://reut.rs/1zA71eX
David Beasley|ATLANTA (Reuters) - Prescription painkillers are used widely by U.S. women of childbearing age, a federal report released on Thursday found, and health officials said exposure to such drugs during pregnancy could increase the risk of birth defects. . Of women aged 15-44, more than a third on Medicaid and a fourth on private insurance filled prescriptions for so-called opioid pain medications each year between 2008-2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Opioids include medications such as hydrocodone, codeine and oxycodone that are taken to treat moderate to severe pain. The study was the first by the CDC to specifically examine their use by women of reproductive age. . Taking the drugs during pregnancy, particularly in the early weeks, can increase the chances that babies will be born with birth defects, the CDC said. . Given the popularity of the painkillers, a thorough health assessment of women of reproductive age is crucial before they are prescribed, officials said. . “Many women of reproductive age are taking these medicines and may not know they are pregnant and therefore may be unknowingly exposing their unborn child,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement. . Prescription rates of opioids for reproductive-aged women were highest in the South and lowest in the Northeast, the CDC study said. . The study did not address why more patients on Medicaid, the federal government’s health insurance plan for the poor, use prescription painkillers. One reason could be that they have more health problems that require pain medication, said CDC epidemiologist Jennifer Lind, one of the study’s authors. . “There may be more women on Medicaid who are manual laborers, jobs that cause more chronic pain,” Lind said in an interview. . Half of all births in the United States are to mothers on Medicaid, according to the CDC. . The federal health agency has launched a program called “Treating for Two” to increase awareness on the potential dangers of prescription painkillers to women of child-bearing age, Lind said. . “What we’re trying to do is expand research and also develop reliable guidance so that women and healthcare providers can have conversations and make informed decisions on what the safest options may be,” she said. |Thu Jan 22 20:00:30 +0000 2015||Wide use of prescription painkillers found in U.S. women of childbearing age: CDC |5.58353533050028e+17|http://reut.rs/1CVdUFs
|(Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Thursday that they are planning to start larger, decisive clinical trials in Liberia in the next two weeks to determine if two new Ebola treatments under development are safe and effective.  . One of the treatments is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline and another by Newlink Genetics Corp with Merck & Co.  . The U.S. government and leading drugmakers have accelerated their efforts to bring a vaccine or treatment to market since the Ebola outbreak reached crisis proportions in West Africa last year. That includes speeding to human trials treatments that had only been tested in non-human primates.  . The treatments are advancing even as the World Health Organization said the epidemic in West Africa appears to be ebbing. . There have been 21,724 cases of Ebola reported in nine countries in the past year since the epidemic began in Guinea, including 8,641 deaths, according to the latest WHO figures. . The officials, speaking on a conference call, also said that they expect to soon start phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials - an earlier stage than the trials for the other two treatments - of the ZMapp Ebola virus treatment that is being developed by privately held Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc.  . They said they believe they have produced enough ZMapp to supply the trials, which are awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and will likely start two to three weeks later.  . Dr. Robin Robinson, Director of the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said it expects to have thousands of doses of the ZMapp drug available by the end of the year for commercial use if the treatment is proved effective in the trials. . In Liberia, about 27,000 people are expected to take part in the trial for the treatments from GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and NewLink. In Sierra Leone, where the officials said they are also considering moving forward with a trial, they are targeting healthcare workers and expect to include about 6,000 people. Sierra Leone has yet to decide which treatment would be used in that trial, the officials said.  |Thu Jan 22 19:35:44 +0000 2015||U.S. health officials say Ebola treatment trial to start soon in Liberia |5.583472986281779e+17|http://reut.rs/1zzZH31
|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sierra Leone has given anti-malaria drugs to more than 2.5 million people in Ebola-affected areas and significantly reduced the number of patients with fever that might have been mistaken for Ebola, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday. . Malaria symptoms - fever, headache, aching joints - are similar to those of Ebola in its early stages, resulting in malaria patients going to Ebola treatment centers, putting pressure on health services and exposing themselves to infection.  . To reduce malaria transmission and deaths, the WHO recommended the mass administration of anti-malarial drugs in Ebola hotspots in the West African country. . “This intervention was done to reduce the number of febrile patients in the community so that people with fever caused by malaria would not be sent to the Ebola holding centers where they would be at risk of contracting Ebola,” Daniel Kertesz,  WHO representative in Sierra Leone, said in a statement. . Without such pre-emptive action, malaria deaths could potentially double in the country of 5.7 million, the WHO said.  . Sierra Leone mobilized 8,330 health workers for the door-to-door distribution in eight districts this month through its national malaria control program and several aid agencies. . People responded positively to the campaign, with numbers of people wishing to receive anti-malarial medicines higher than expected, the WHO said.  . More than 1.7 million people contracted malaria in Sierra Leone last year, resulting in 4,326 deaths, according to WHO data.     |Thu Jan 22 18:53:55 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone emergency anti-malaria drive reaches 2.5 million people |5.5833677623095296e+17|http://reut.rs/1zzQPKD
Ben Hirschler|DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The GAVI global vaccines alliance is seeking to raise $7.5 billion at a funding conference in Berlin next week, as its battle to prevent infectious diseases in millions of children reaches an expected peak. . The non-profit organization, launched in Davos 15 years ago, aims to immunize another 300 million children between 2016 and 2020, saving an estimated 5-6 million lives. . The economic benefits of that will be some $80 billion and $100 billion, underscoring the cost-effectiveness of vaccines as a centerpiece of public health, Chief Executive Seth Berkley told the World Economic Forum on Thursday. . Berkley said GAVI had already received extremely strong support from several governments but other major donors that have backed past funding rounds, notably the United States, have yet to show their hand ahead of the Jan. 26-27 Berlin talks. . One factor complicating the financing request is the strength of the dollar. GAVI buys its vaccines in the U.S. currency, while some donors will face higher costs in local currencies. . “We made our original requests almost seven months ago and exchange rates have dramatically changed. That is a challenge that we will have in front of us and will be discussed by the donors,” Berkley said. . GAVI, which is backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, UNICEF, donor governments and others, funds immunization programs for nations that cannot afford standard prices. . The group targets common but deadly diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea and cervical cancer. . GAVI uses its bulk-buying power to negotiate big price discounts with drugmakers like GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, although some have argued it should strike even tougher deals with companies. . A full budget will also position GAVI to intervene in emergency situations such as Ebola, where it has already pledged to fund vaccine purchases once products are developed. . The coming 2016-20 period will be the busiest in GAVI’s history, as it ramps up vaccine purchases to 2.7 billion doses from 2.1 billion in the preceding five years. . Beyond 2020, however, GAVI’s immunization programs are set to tail off, as many countries with growing economies become too wealthy to be eligible for its help. . “This is peak GAVI,” Berkley said. “We actually discussed whether we should consider going out of business and we looked at 2030 as a possible date, but the challenge is that there will still be about 20 eligible countries, assuming the modeling is correct, and the majority are pretty fragile states.” |Thu Jan 22 18:53:55 +0000 2015||Vaccines group seeks $7.5 billion as disease fight reaches peak |5.583367745993482e+17|http://reut.rs/1CUWU21
|LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Leprosy sufferers worldwide face discriminatory laws affecting their right to work, travel and marry, according to an advocacy group which called upon governments to follow U.N. guidelines and abolish such legislation. . Around 20 countries, including India, Thailand and Nepal, have or continue to pass laws that discriminate against people with leprosy, the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP) said ahead of World Leprosy Day on Sunday. . There were more than 200,000 new leprosy cases reported worldwide in 2013, yet this number has shrunk by 20 percent since 2006, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). . The U.N adopted a resolution in 2010, urging governments to abolish all discriminatory laws against people affected by leprosy and their family, ILEP said.  . “Some countries have repealed their laws and started public education campaigns to stop stigma against men, women and children affected by leprosy... we applaud those which have taken such action,” ILEP President Jan Van Berkel said in a statement.  . Millions of people and their families still suffer from the stigma associated with the disease, which is perpetuated by outdated laws and regulations, ILEP said. . India has at least 15 laws discriminating against those with leprosy, prohibiting them from standing for election or hold a driver’s license, according to the anti-leprosy federation.  . People can also be forcibly removed from residential areas and segregated from society even if they have been cured. . The study said India, home to 60 percent of the world’s new leprosy cases in 2013, was reviewing its discriminatory laws. . Thailand, Nepal and Singapore were among countries  discriminating against leprosy sufferers when it came to marriage, divorce and employment, while Malaysia and South Africa have segregation and separation laws for those affected. . The Philippines and Namibia can refuse entry visas to people with the disease, and people from Pakistan living in the Gulf states face immediate repatriation if diagnosed with leprosy.  . Dainius Pūras, U.N. special rapporteur on the right to health, urged all governments to give consideration to the U.N. resolution and follow in the footsteps of Greece, China, Ethiopia, Oman, Ukraine, Estonia and Ecuador in repealing discriminatory laws, ILEP said.  . Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease causing disfiguring skin ulcers and nerve damage in the arms and legs.  . In the past leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, was regarded as incurable, and patients often became social outcasts, but it can now be treated with antibiotics. |Thu Jan 22 18:53:54 +0000 2015||Laws deny leprosy sufferers right to work, travel, marry: study |5.583367724476662e+17|http://reut.rs/1zzQPKG
Caroline Humer|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc and AbbVie Inc are in a price war over their hepatitis C treatments that is driving costs lower and has changed the way drugmakers price new medicines, a top executive for pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts said on Thursday.  . Gilead’s hepatitis C drug Harvoni, which can cure a majority of patients who take it, has a retail price of $94,500 and is now facing its first competition with AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, which was priced about $10,000 lower, or at $83,319.  . Express Scripts was able to secure a discount that has brought the AbbVie price down to Western European levels for Gilead’s hepatitis C treatment, Chief Medical Officer Steven Miller told Reuters. Such prices overseas range from about $51,000 to $66,000.  . The gap in price between Harvoni and Viekira has stayed about the same as both have fallen, Miller said. . The dynamic will save Express Scripts customers $1 billion in 2015, with a total of $4 billion in savings across the United States when all payers and employers are included, Miller said. He expects over 170,000 people will be treated for the liver-destroying virus in the United States in 2015, up from 100,000 last year. . “This is the first time in the history of the pharmaceutical industry that someone has been able to create a price war,” Miller said in an interview.  . Gilead set off a national debate about the affordability of drugs last year after it priced its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at $84,000 per treatment, or about $1,000 per pill. That drug has been followed by a combination pill that is more expensive called Harvoni.   . An estimated 3.2 million people in America have the virus, and many health insurers and payers said the cost of treating all of them would be unaffordable. . Express Scripts Holding Co, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits manager, has been the most vocal critic of Gilead for its pricing. When U.S. health regulators approved AbbVie’s Viekira Pak in late December, Express Scripts announced within days that it was dropping coverage of Gilead’s treatments from its largest list of reimbursable drugs, except under certain medical exceptions.  . Express Scripts and its clients are reaping new savings as prices head lower from both Gilead and AbbVie, but that will not change Harvoni’s place on its reimbursement list in the near future. . “They cannot buy their way back onto the national preferred formulary at this time,” Miller said of Gilead. Express Scripts’ agreement with AbbVie spans multiple years but Miller declined to say how many. . Beyond hepatitis C, other drugmakers are showing much more willingness to discuss pricing early on in the development of new treatments, Miller said. That includes more detailed talks on how many patients would most benefit from a new therapy. . The industry is closely watching two new areas to see how the pricing dynamics will play out - PCSK9s for high cholesterol and PD-1s for cancer.  . “More companies are coming to us, telling us about their pipeline and wanting to know what kind of data we want to see,” Miller said. |Thu Jan 22 18:53:54 +0000 2015||Express Scripts' Miller says hepatitis C price war to save billions |5.58336770849665e+17|http://reut.rs/1CUWU25
|(Reuters) - A Nebraska hospital on Thursday announced it has discharged an American healthcare worker who was at high risk for the Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone but who did not develop the disease. . The patient had been monitored at the University of Nebraska Medical Center since arriving on Jan. 4 after a flight from Sierra Leone to Omaha, hospital officials said. . “We are happy to report the patient showed no clinical or laboratory evidence of Ebola infection,” Phil Smith, medical director of the Biocontainment Unit at the hospital, said in a statement. “The patient was regularly tested for the disease since arriving here in early January and every test came back negative for Ebola.” . The patient has left the Omaha area, the statement said. . The hospital did not disclose the age or gender of the patient, but did release a statement from the person. . “The hardest part of the last few weeks was leaving my patients in Sierra Leone, who were some of the sickest I have ever seen,” the patient said. “I hope to return to West Africa to help in the fight against Ebola but for now I am looking forward to spending some time with my family and friends.” . Three other patients were treated last year for Ebola in the Biocontainment Unit last year, said hospital spokesman Taylor Wilson. Two of those patients were treated successfully and a third, who was gravely ill upon arrival, died. . Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever. The latest outbreak, first identified in Guinea’s remote southeast in early 2014, has struck six West African nations, with Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia bearing the brunt of the more than 21,000 infections and more than 8,600 dead. |Thu Jan 22 18:53:53 +0000 2015||Nebraska hospital releases patient found not to have Ebola |5.5833676909644595e+17|http://reut.rs/1zzQQ0Y
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – Contrary to most treatment guidelines for uncomplicated headaches, doctors are ordering expensive scans and referring patients to specialists more often, racking up unnecessary healthcare costs, a new study finds. . “In U.S. healthcare we have a general overtreatment problem and headache is no different except that with headaches a lot of the overtreatment is potentially low value and high cost,” said lead author Dr. John Mafi, an internal medicine fellow at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. . The great majority of people will experience a headache at some point in life, and about one in four Americans have recurrent severe headaches such as migraines. About 12 million Americans visit their doctors complaining of headaches each year at an annual cost of about $31 billion, Mafi and his colleagues write in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. . Most evidence-based guidelines for headaches advise conservative treatments such as counseling about stress reduction or avoiding dietary triggers for headaches, and reserve imaging or specialty referrals for “red flag” headaches that stem from neurologic problems, cancer, trauma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the authors note. . “Oftentimes less can be more, particularly for things like uncomplicated headache where the vast majority of times they’ll go away on their own with very conservative treatment and by listening to your body and really paying attention to the triggers,” Mafi told Reuters Health.  . Mafi thinks many people have a misconception that more referrals and tests equal better care than simple, but often effective, lifestyle counseling. . To analyze trends in headache treatment from 1999 to 2010, Mafi and colleagues looked at national healthcare databases. They examined more than 9,000 physician visits that were representative of the 144 million total visits for headache during that time period. The study team omitted visits for headaches associated with red flag conditions.  . The researchers discovered that use of advanced imaging procedures such as CT scans and MRIs rose from less than 7 percent of visits in 1999-2000 to almost 14 percent in 2009-2010. Referrals to other physicians increased from about 7 percent to 13 percent.  . The use of over-the-counter medications remained stable at approximately 16 percent, but use of anti-migraine medications such as triptans and ergot alkaloids rose from about 10 percent to more than 15 percent. Opioid and barbiturate use remained unchanged.  . The study team also found that clinician counseling for lifestyle changes dropped from almost 24 percent of visits to less than 19 percent.  . Mafi doesn’t blame primary care providers, saying they’re overworked, and there are financial and medico-legal pressures to order excessive testing procedures. . He thinks the current “20-minute model” of healthcare is broken and suggests moving toward one that reimburses electronic communications and secure messaging, along with patients’ ability to enter their information online. . “There’s less time than ever in the primary care visits because the doctors are increasingly hurried, it’s just that much easier to click a button, order the test and move on because it takes so much more effort and time to actually counsel the patient and to explain to the patient why a test is unnecessary,” he said. . In their report, Mafi’s team notes that the increase in the use of scans such as CT and MRI is “of particular concern” because of the added costs and potential harms of the scans themselves. In addition to the anxiety provoked in patients, scans may lead to unnecessary follow-up tests and incidental findings. . Moreover, contrast dyes used for some kinds of scans can provoke allergies or kidney problems, they note. Finally, they write, the unnecessary exposure to radiation is also a hazard, pointing to an estimate that 4,000 additional cancers were created by the 18 million head CT scans performed in the U.S. in 2007. . For busy clinicians, Mafi said, “One of the most important things that primary care can do is to stress nonpharmacological therapies, so just going over common dietary triggers like caffeine, chocolate and alcohol.” . He added that counseling patients on good sleep hygiene and stress reduction are also important. “And most important (counseling on) just leading an overall healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting plenty of exercise.” . Mafi said that having patients keep a daily diary of the events leading up to a headache is critical in helping to identify the patient’s personal triggers.  . “And when they can identify all the different triggers in their life, they can make active changes that actually prevent headaches from starting, which could actually lessen the need for more tests, medications and even doctor visits,” he said. .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Heath) - In a study of Dutch professional footballers, a bone deformity at the hip was much more common among men who started playing the sport at least four times a week before age twelve. . If the bones of the hip don’t develop normally during childhood, a so-called cam deformity can occur, with extra bone growing near the ball-shaped top of the femur, potentially leading to joint damage and pain, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS).  . Cam deformities begin to show up on X-rays in early adolescence, and tend to be more common among males and athletes in high-impact sports, the authors of the new study note in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. . “It is in youth, during growth, that bone activity is high and bone is very responsive to loading,” said lead author Igor Tak of the Sports Rehabilitation and Manual Therapy Department at Physiotherapy Utrecht Oost in The Netherlands. . “For girls this is between 10-14 and for boys this on the average 1.5 years later,” Tak told Reuters Health by email. “This suits our findings that when the threshold of loading with a high and low frequency is set at 12 years or 13 years of age, differences are visible between hip morphology of these boys later in life when being an elite player.” . For the new study, Tak and his coauthors studied X-rays of the hips of 63 players from two Dutch football clubs. The players’ average age was 23.  . The researchers also used preseason player questionnaires, which include questions about their the men’s age when they started playing football and the age when they transitioned from playing three or fewer times per week to playing four or more times per week. . On average, the players had started practicing soccer at an amateur level around age six, and entered a professional football club, which would require four or more sessions per week, between ages 12 and 13.  . The study team found that 40 of the 63 footballers had some type of cam deformity in one or both hips, while 18 had a “pathological deformity” at an angle severe enough to be associated with developing hip osteoarthritis at an older age. . Considering the 63 players’ total of 126 hips individually, 40 percent of those who had started playing in a professional club after age 12 had a cam deformity, compared to 64 percent of those who started before age 12. There was a similar difference in the number of pathological deformities. . Cam deformities make the “ball” part of the hip’s ball-and-socket less round, which can increase the risk of osteoarthritis later, Tak said. People who play ice hockey, football and basketball often have cam deformities, he said. . Athletes may work their hip joints more and begin to experience hip pain earlier, but exercise does not cause cam deformities, according to the AAOS. . Regular people who do not become elite athletes may experience the same thing if they play high-impact sports frequently during bone development, Tak said. Young people should moderate their high-impact sport participation around the age of the “growth spurt,” and it would be helpful to more exactly define when that is, but more information is needed on this topic, he said.  . Almost a third of white males develop a cam deformity, and only a small number will develop clinical complaints of restricted range of motion or osteoarthritis pain, even at an older age, said Dr. Emmanuel Audenaert, an orthopedic surgeon at Ghent University in Belgium, who was not involved in the new study. . For the hips, growth plates stay open until age 16 to 18, which is relatively late, Audenaert said. . “During puberty and as a result of changing testosterone hormone balance, the growth plate weakens around the age of 12-13, making it even more sensitive to displacement or deformity,” Audenaert told Reuters Health by email. . “Severe muscular training and high loading activities should be restricted until skeletal maturity for any joint and sport,” he said. “At young age sportsmen should train on endurance, and maybe most of all technique.” . The results would likely be similar for non-elite athletes, but they would not have the same close medical follow-up and their hip problems may not be detected until middle age, he said. . The results of other investigations have been mixed and the new study only looks back at the pasts of current adult players, said Dr. Kasper Gosvig of Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark, who was not involved in the Dutch report. Another study following kids as they play sports and their cam deformities emerge is needed, he told Reuters Health by email.|Thu Jan 22 16:28:48 +0000 2015||Heavy soccer playing before age 12 tied to later hip deformities |5.583002553061499e+17|http://reut.rs/1y35qHI
|ABUJA (Reuters) - An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Nigeria has spread to 21 commercial farms in seven different states, with more than 140,000 birds having been exposed to the virus, the agriculture minister said on Thursday. . Authorities said the deadly virus had arrived in Lagos, in the southwest, and Kano, in the north, last week. . Agriculture Minister Akinwumi Adesina said it had now spread to five other states across the country: Ogun, Delta, Rivers, Edo and Plateau. . Around 100,000 of the birds exposed were in Kano, Adesina said. . “All the farms have been quarantined and decontaminated. Other locations in Ikorodu, Ojo and Lagos Mainland have already been quarantined, while awaiting confirmation,” he said. . “Nigeria will successfully control the bird flu outbreak. We have successfully controlled it in the past,” he added. . Africa’s most populous country and biggest economy was the continent’s first country to detect bird flu in 2006, when chicken farms were found to have the H5N1 strain. In 2007, it reported its first human death from the disease. . H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths. |Thu Jan 22 11:33:42 +0000 2015||Nigeria H5N1 bird flu now in 7 states, suspected in 140,000 birds: minister |5.582259926665953e+17|http://reut.rs/1y1PrJU
Sara Ledwith|LONDON (Reuters) - From Apple Pie to Bubbly Bubble Gum, Irish Car Bomb or Martian bar – from Mars!, the flavors of electronic cigarette offer something for every taste. . Researchers have counted 7,764 varieties of ‘vape.’ That adds up to one of many challenges - from practical constraints to conflicts of interest - in working out how safe e-cigs are, and whether they help smokers quit. . Most scientists agree e-cigs have potential as a stop-smoking aid. They can be used with or without nicotine and are free of the thousands of toxins in conventional cigarettes. But e-cigs also throw up some unusual obstacles. . Drug firms usually test one treatment against another. With e-cigarettes, the huge variety of constantly evolving products means it would be prohibitively expensive to test every flavor and vaporizer. . “E-cigs are really the first product I’m aware of that have challenged pharma in this way,” said Chris Bullen, an associate professor at the University of Auckland and author of one of two randomized trials of e-cigs in a recent major review of the science. “I guess many alternative ‘natural’ products raise similar issues when they start to make health claims.” . E-cigarettes can look like ordinary smokes but are metal and plastic battery-powered gadgets that heat flavored liquids into a cloud which users suck in, then exhale as dense white plumes. Invented in their present form in China about a decade ago, e-cigarettes generated $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in 2014, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm. . The gadgets themselves come in hundreds of brands and are constantly morphing, at the hands of both users and the small-scale distributors who sell them online. . Because they are a strange hybrid between smoking – which kills nearly 6 million people a year – and stop-smoking medications, e-cigs rival both tobacco and pharma. Tobacco companies have responded to that threat by buying up e-cig businesses, and are now funding research. Pharma firms have kept their distance.  . The products have also opened a rift between researchers who see their goal as eliminating nicotine in all its forms, and others who believe it makes more sense to reduce the harm of smoking. . “You’ve got people who’ve taken a position and they’re looking at the evidence only in relation to the position they’ve got,” David Sweanor, an e-cig enthusiast and law professor at the University of Ottawa, told an e-cigarette symposium in London in November.     . There are more than 2,000 papers on e-cigarettes in the scholarly journals covered by the Web of Science, a database. Of those in the highest impact journals, most have been funded by public bodies. Only a few contain original research; methodological problems or potential bias are common, scientists have found. . Last month, in an attempt to clear matters up, Bullen and other scientists in Britain and New Zealand published their assessment of the most impartial studies. Known as a Cochrane Review - a study of the best science on a subject - it aimed to see if e-cigs can help people stop smoking. . The review concluded that e-cigs may help smokers quit, and that there is little sign that they hurt users. . But it found the evidence thin and data poor. Of almost 600 studies analyzed, only 13 published papers were up to the Cochrane standard. Just two were randomized controlled trials, the most rigorous test. . Big Pharma is not helping. The pharmaceutical industry has backed efforts to restrict e-cigarettes and is not sponsoring a single current e-cigarette trial in the U.S. National Institutes of Health database.  . For drugs firms, smoking cessation is a small business, generating $2.4 billion in sales in 2013, according to Euromonitor. That’s just a fraction of the $206 billion the industry generated in global consumer health products. . “We’ve decided we’re not going to play (in e-cigs),” GlaxoSmithKline Chief Executive Andrew Witty told Reuters. “We’ve consciously had a think about it but we’re not going to play.” . This leaves e-cigarette companies to fund their own research, giving rise to concerns over conflicts of interest. . In 2010 one European e-cig distributor, Italian firm Arbi Group Srl, sponsored a significant body of work by a team at Catania University in Sicily. Catania researchers are among the most prolific, records in the Web of Science show; they conducted the second of the two randomized trials included in the Cochrane Review and are working on nine of the 48 trials on e-cigarettes logged with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). . The Catania randomized trial took 300 smokers who did not intend to quit and found that, with or without nicotine, e-cigarettes cut cigarette consumption and helped some people stop completely, without significant adverse effects. That supported claims e-cigarettes had a role reducing the harm of smoking. . “At the end of the day we were stuck accepting money from e-cigarette owners because there was no other way to carry out research,” said Catania professor Riccardo Polosa, who designed the trial. He said he had also received funding from pharma. . That, says Charlotta Pisinger, a Danish doctor who runs stop-smoking clinics, is a problem. Last October she published a review which found one in three e-cigarette studies had a conflict of interest because they were funded by e-cig manufacturers, pharma or tobacco, or a combination. She saw evidence of bias: “We must exercise the utmost caution in trusting their conclusions,” she wrote. . Experienced medical researchers say industry funding to test new products is the norm. . “The majority of clinical research is sponsored by the manufacturers,” said David Tovey, editor in chief of the Cochrane Library, which vets Cochrane Reviews. Another Cochrane study has found that scientific studies sponsored by private industry generally reported greater benefits and fewer harmful side effects than studies industry did not sponsor. . E-cigarette opponents are also being scrutinized for bias. . A 2014 U.S. review of the literature, carried out for the World Health Organization at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), said that the two randomized trials had shown e-cigarettes were no better than other nicotine replacement therapies at helping people quit. . In August, the World Health Organisation recommended that smokers should be encouraged to try already approved treatments, rather than e-cigs.  . Stanton Glantz, a veteran campaigner in the war against Big Tobacco and professor at UCSF, was one author of the U.S. review. But some researchers say activists like Glantz may have been prejudiced against e-cigarettes by their past battles with the tobacco industry. . Robert West, a professor at University College London, is an e-cigarette enthusiast who has been funded by pharma, but not by e-cig makers. He says some opponents present themselves as unbiased, but “their professional and moral stance represents a substantial vested interest.” . Glantz says he started his review “completely agnostic.” . To add to the controversy, Big Tobacco is getting more deeply involved. E-cigarettes are a threat to the $722 billion retail sales of conventional cigarettes globally in 2013, but they are also an opportunity. Fewer people are smoking in the rich world. Shane MacGuill, senior tobacco analyst at Euromonitor, calls tobacco a “terminally sick” industry. E-cigarettes may offset the decline. . Firms including Reynolds American Inc. and Imperial Tobacco Group PLC have sponsored seven of the e-cig trials in the NIH trials database. . Tobacco executives mingled with researchers and anti-smoking activists at the London symposium last November. The conference was held at the Royal Society, an association of scientists whose fellows include around 80 Nobel Laureates. Beneath portraits of such illustrious figures as Stephen Hawking, delegates puffed on vaporizers. . Some delegates said they found being in the same room as tobacco firms discomfiting. The industry’s history of suppressing the truth about tobacco’s risks still prompts some universities and academic journals to shun tobacco, and the World Health Organization is forbidden from collaborating with it. . E-cigs are helping tobacco companies transform their image. Firms that for years denied tobacco’s harms now emphasize that nicotine itself is not harmful, we just need safer ways to administer it. Some are stepping into smoking cessation: British American Tobacco already has a medical license for a medicinal nicotine inhaler. A Reynolds subsidiary sells nicotine gum.  . Big Tobacco has some support among those in public health who think it won’t be necessary to eliminate nicotine, so we should reduce the harm of smoking. But as universities ban association with tobacco firms, it will become even harder for independent researchers to study vaping. |Thu Jan 22 11:33:42 +0000 2015||The smoke around e-cig science |5.582259910685737e+17|http://reut.rs/1uxn5N4
Stephanie Nebehay|GENEVA (Reuters) - The Ebola epidemic in West Africa appears to be ebbing, with fewer than 150 cases reported in the past week, but efforts must be pursued to stamp out the deadly disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday. . Sierra Leone remains hardest-hit, accounting for 117 of the 145 new confirmed cases, against 184 there the previous week and 248 the week before that, the WHO said in its latest update. . “Case incidence continues to fall in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone,” the United Nations agency said, adding that  disease surveillance was being stepped up in border districts of Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal. . Every 10 days the number of new cases is halving in Guinea — where, at 20, the figure was the lowest since early August, it said. In Liberia, where confirmed cases last week fell to 8 from a peak of more than 300 per week in August and September, it takes two weeks to halve, and in Sierra Leone nearly 20 days. . In all, there have been 21,724 cases of Ebola reported in nine countries in the past year since the epidemic began in Guinea, including 8,641 deaths, the WHO said.  . The virus has been stamped out in Mali, Nigeria and Senegal, and there have been no further cases among foreign health workers returning to Britain, Spain or the United States, although a British nurse is recovering in hospital in London. . To date, 828 health care workers have been infected in the three worst-hit countries, including 499 who died, it said.  . U.N. agencies need a final $1 billion to fight the deadly Ebola epidemic as experts move to a new phase involving a massive detective operation to trace remaining cases, U.N. Ebola chief David Nabarro said on Wednesday. . “Incidents of community resistance to safe burials and contact tracing continue to be reported in all three countries, although they are most common in Guinea,” the WHO said. . The WHO’s Emergency Committee on Ebola said on Wednesday that passengers should still be screened on leaving Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone for temperature or other signs of infection.  . The independent experts said in a statement that “more than 40 countries have implemented additional measures, such as quarantine of returning travelers and refusal of entry. Such measures are impeding the recruitment and return of international responders.  . “They also have harmful effects on local populations by increasing stigma and isolation, and by disrupting livelihoods and economies.” |Thu Jan 22 11:06:43 +0000 2015||Ebola ebbing in West Africa but vigilance needed: WHO |5.582191997731717e+17|http://reut.rs/1y1IPLO
Andrew Osborn|LONDON (Reuters) - The British government plans to introduce a law before May forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets without branding in England, ending years of debate and lobbying. . The move, aimed at improving public health and cutting the number of child smokers, is likely to crimp tobacco firms’ profits and would emulate Australia, which two years ago enacted a groundbreaking law forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain olive green packaging with images showing the damaging effects of smoking. . Cigarette sales have dropped in Australia since plain packaging was introduced on Dec. 1, 2012, prompting Britain to act before its national election in May even as Australia battles international legal challenges from other countries and manufacturers. . Jane Ellison, a junior minister in Britain’s health ministry, said introducing plain packaging was “a proportionate and justified response” because of the health risks associated with smoking.  . “In doing so we would be bringing the prospect of our first smoke-free generation one step closer,” she said in a statement. . The new law, which is likely to be approved comfortably, would take effect in 2016. . The government previously said it wanted to ban cigarette branding but would hold a final consultation, stirring suspicion it wanted to further delay legislation.  . Tobacco firms have fiercely resisted the new law, saying plain packs infringe on intellectual property rights covering brands and will only increase counterfeiting and smuggling. . “Legal action is always a last resort but when legislation is published we will be considering our options,” said a spokesman for Imperial Tobacco. Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco company and maker of Marlboro cigarettes, has already indicated it would be prepared to sue the government.  . Shares in tobacco groups drifted down on Thursday morning, with FTSE 100 group Imperial Tobacco down 1.3 percent.     . The opposition Labour Party welcomed the move, but criticized the government for moving too slowly after MPs voted for the change almost a year ago. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will need to consent to legislation introduced in England. . Around 3.4 percent fewer cigarettes were sold in Australia in 2013, compared with 2012, according to Treasury Department data. The government had previously withheld data on sales to protect commercially sensitive information, and has yet to release the figures for 2014. . A quintet of tobacco-producing nations — Indonesia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Ukraine — are challenging the Australian law at the World Trade Organization. Hearings are due to begin in May with a decision unlikely before 2016. . Philip Morris Asia Ltd is contesting the packaging issue in the international Permanent Court of Arbitration under Australia’s bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The court ruled last year Australia could challenge Philip Morris’ right to contest the laws on the grounds the company only bought shares in its Australian arm to bring the case.  |Thu Jan 22 08:53:58 +0000 2015||UK aims to pass law to ban branding on cigarette packs before May |5.581857934462198e+17|http://reut.rs/1y1eigZ
Eric M. Johnson|SEATTLE (Reuters) - Washington state could become the only U.S. state to raise its legal age for smoking tobacco to 21 from 18 under a measure proposed on Wednesday by its top law enforcement official. . The legislation, if enacted, would also put the legal age for purchasing and possessing tobacco and nicotine-vapor products on an equal footing with the state’s minimum drinking age of 21, with the goal of restricting access to teens and lowering healthcare expenses. . The measure, however, would cost the state some $20 million a year in estimated tax revenue. . “Research shows the young adult brain, still developing between 18 and 21, is highly susceptible to nicotine addiction,” Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement.  . “We must do more to protect our youth from tobacco’s grip, and this bill is an important step toward keeping nicotine out of the hands of kids and young adults,” he said. . The legislation would bring the cigarette-purchasing age in the Democratic-leaning Pacific Northwest state in line with the threshold for buying recreational marijuana products, which state voters opted to legalize in 2012 for residents at least 21 years old. . Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths annually, or one of every five deaths overall, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   . Most U.S. states set the legal smoking age at 18, while a handful have set it higher at 19. Some cities and counties, including New York City and Hawaii County, have already raised the smoking age to 21. . The U.S. West as a region has a lower smoking prevalence rate than other parts of the country, at 14.2 percent, according to 2012 census data. The rate in the Midwest stands at 26 percent, the South at 19.7 percent and the Northeast at 16.5 percent, the CDC said. . Ferguson was joined by two Washington state lawmakers, Republican Senator Mark Miloscia and Democratic Representative Tina Orwall, who said they expect opposition from the tobacco industry as well as from some colleagues in the legislature. . Altria Group Inc, which owns Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. .  More than 90 percent of smokers began the habit in their teens, Ferguson said, citing federal data from 2012. He said smoking kills 8,300 Washington residents annually and contributes $2.8 billion in healthcare costs. |Thu Jan 22 03:27:20 +0000 2015||Washington state attorney general seeks to raise smoking age to 21 |5.581035926878986e+17|http://reut.rs/1uvRPya
|(Reuters) - Five employees of Disneyland have been infected with measles in an outbreak traced to the California amusement park, although three of them have recovered from the viral disease and are back on the job, company officials said on Wednesday. . Orange County health officials told the Disneyland resort on Tuesday that two employees had tested positive and had been placed on medical leave, the fifth case since last Thursday, a Disney spokeswoman said. . “Cast members who may have come in contact with those who were positive are being tested for the virus,” Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pamela Hymel said in a statement. . California health officials earlier this month linked the worst outbreak of measles in more than a decade to Disneyland, saying anyone who visited the amusement park in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and 20 may have been exposed.  . More than 50 people have become infected in California as well as other U.S. states and Mexico, health officials said. . Disneyland began offering vaccinations and medical screenings after it learned of the outbreak on Jan. 7, a spokeswoman said. Last Thursday, it learned one employee tested positive. Three have been treated and are back at work. . On Tuesday, Huntington Beach High School, about 15 miles (24 km) from Disneyland, told students who had not been vaccinated for measles to stay home for two weeks after learning one of their classmates was infected.  . The California Department of Public Health said there have been 59 confirmed measles cases among California residents so far in 2015. Of those, 42 cases have been linked to exposure in December at Disneyland.  . This includes the five employees, four of whom worked there and one who is believed to have been infected as a guest. Of the cases outside California linked to the Disneyland outbreak, there has been one in Mexico, three in Utah, two in Washington state, and one each in Oregon and Colorado. . Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by the appearance of a red rash that typically starts on the face and spreads downward. The sometimes deadly viral disease can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Thu Jan 22 01:28:01 +0000 2015||Five Disneyland employees infected with measles in California |5.580735657494692e+17|http://reut.rs/1uvpW9s
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - Video-based therapy for families with babies at risk of autism improves infants’ engagement, attention and social behavior, and might reduce their risk chances of developing the condition, the findings of a small scientific study show. . Researchers publishing the findings in The Lancet Psychiatry journal said they showed that using video feedback-based therapy to help parents understand and respond to their baby’s early communication style might help modify emerging autism symptoms. . “Targeting the earliest risk markers of autism, such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement, during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later,” said Jonathan Green, a Manchester University professor of child and adolescent psychiatry, who led the study. . People with autism have varying levels of impairment across three areas: social interaction and understanding, repetitive behavior and interests, and language and communication. . The exact causes of the neurodevelopmental disorder are not known, but evidence shows they are likely to include a range of genetic and environmental factors. . As many as one in 50 school-age children in the United States are diagnosed with autism, although some of these will be milder cases. In Europe, the rate is around one in 100 children. . In this study, a specially adapted Video Interaction for Promoting Positive Parenting Programme (iBASIS-VIPP) was delivered to babies aged seven to 10 months who had a higher risk of autism because they had an autistic older sibling. . Fifty-four families with a high-risk baby were randomly assigned to get either iBASIS-VIPP or no intervention. The video group got at least six home visits, where a therapist used video feedback to help parents respond to the baby’s communication and improve attention, language development and social engagement. . After five months, families who received video therapy showed improvements in infant engagement, attention and social behavior, suggesting the therapy may be able to modify the emergence of autism-related symptoms, the researchers said. . They also noted, however, that babies in the video group appeared to have a reduced responsiveness to language sounds. . Experts not directly involved in the research praised it as robust and gave a cautious welcome to its findings: . “It will be important to document whether any such changes observed in the children’s behavior persist in the absence of continued intervention,” said Melissa Allen, a psychology lecturer and autism specialist at the University of Lancaster. . “Whether these changes are long lasting and can prevent an autism diagnosis remains an open and essential question.” |Thu Jan 22 00:27:34 +0000 2015||Video-based therapy may help babies at risk of autism: study |5.5805835561772646e+17|http://reut.rs/1xZwrfg
|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said counterfeit versions of the erectile dysfunction drug Cialis were found in the mail en route to a customer in the United States, and it is alerting consumers and doctors to be on the lookout for fakes. . FDA laboratory analysis showed the counterfeit versions contain multiple active ingredients, which if used could result in adverse effects or harm, the agency said in a notice posted on its website on Wednesday.  . Genuine Cialis, a rival of Pfizer’s widely used Viagra, is sold by Eli Lilly and Co. . The FDA is not aware of any consumer adverse events related to the use of counterfeit Cialis, it said, adding that health care professionals and consumers should report any such problems related to the use of suspect medications to FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. . There is no indication that the legitimate supply chain is at risk, so consumers can be confident that prescription medicines received through legitimate state-licensed pharmacies located in the United States are safe, the agency said. . It cautioned against purchasing prescription medicines online, noting that some websites may be selling unsafe products.  . The FDA listed several differences in the packaging of the counterfeit bottle of 20 milligram Cialis seized in the mail, including different patterns and colors on the label and a misspelling of Cialis on the side of the bottle. The agency posted pictures of a genuine Cialis bottle and the counterfeit, highlighting the differences. . The origin of the counterfeit Cialis was not disclosed. . In late 2011, fake versions of Roche’s multibillion-dollar cancer drug Avastin turned up at several U.S. oncology practices, setting off an international investigation and heightened scrutiny of the pharmaceutical supply chains. |Wed Jan 21 23:56:01 +0000 2015||Counterfeit Cialis found entering U.S. by mail: FDA |5.5805041619451904e+17|http://reut.rs/1uv4bq7
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Young people who are more receptive to alcohol ads on TV may be at higher risk of problem drinking over the next few years, according to a new study. . “If you compare low- to high-receptivity kids, their risk of transitioning to binge drinking was over four times higher,” said Dr. James Sargent, the study’s senior author from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College in Lebanon, New Hampshire. . Sargent and his colleagues write in JAMA Pediatrics that in 2013, about two thirds of U.S. high school students reported drinking. About a third reported drinking in the past month, and about one in five reported recent binge drinking, that is, five or more drinks on one occasion. . Previous research tried to establish a link between TV alcohol advertisements and young people’s drinking behaviors, but with conflicting results. . For the new study, the researchers applied a method previously used to find a link between smoking shown in movies and people’s smoking behavior. The method involves showing people ads stripped of brands, to see what they can recall from having seen the ad on TV. . In 2010 and 2011, more than 3,000 people ages 15 to 23 answered a series of questions over the phone and then finished the image portion of the study online. Two years later, 1,596 participants completed follow-up surveys.  . The youngest participants were only slightly less likely than the oldest ones - about 23 percent versus 26 percent - to report having seen alcohol ads, to like the ads they saw and to identify the alcohol brands in the ads. . Liking and remembering ads was considered a sign of greater receptivity to the advertising message. And at the two-year follow-up, participants who had scored highest for receptivity were more likely to have transitioned to drinking, binge drinking and hazardous drinking. . “This study suggests that alcohol marketing does affect subsequent drinking behaviors,” Sargent said. . He said they also checked for a link between fast food TV ads and drinking behaviors. There was no connection, which reduces the chance that children who progressed to drinking were simply more susceptible to ads in general. . Sam Zakhari, chief scientist of the Distilled Spirits Council, wrote in a statement to Reuters Health that new research is driven by advocacy – not science. . “The clearest indication of this is that according to the U.S. government, underage drinking is at historic lows, yet advertising and marketing are at all-time highs,” Zakhari said. “The multiple flaws in this study undercuts the credibility of its conclusions.” . Zakhari, a former director at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said, “research shows that advertising does not cause someone to begin drinking alcohol or to drink more.” . Previous studies have found links between advertising and drinking behaviors, however. . Last year, researchers found that the preferred brands of alcohol among underage drinkers match brands advertised in the most popular magazines in that age group. . David Jernigan, lead author of the 2014 study, said the new work by Sargent and colleagues is “yet another study showing that exposure to alcohol advertising on TV is associated with young people progressing to more hazardous drinking.” . “This is the kind of research we need to inform a robust policy debate about what we can do that will actually protect kids,” said Jernigan, who directs the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and was not involved in the new study. . Jernigan said his research suggests there are ways for companies to target people of legal drinking age on TV without influencing underage viewers. One way is to target ads at people closer to 30 and older. . “Alcohol advertising is aimed at 21 to 25 or 28 year olds,” said Sargent. “Given the similarity in terms of psychology of 21 year olds and 18 year olds and 17 year olds, and the similarity of the programs that they watch, it’s really absurd that you can have advertisements that target 21 year olds without influencing  a 17 or 18 year old. It’s just really common sense.” . SOURCE: .

Toni Clarke|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People who smoke high-voltage e-cigarettes have greater exposure to formaldehyde, a suspected carcinogen, than those who keep the voltage low, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. . The study, which critics say is misleading and lacks context, is the latest contribution to a debate on the safety of e-cigarettes that has so far has yielded little long-term data, though most experts believe they are less toxic than combustible cigarettes.     . Researchers from Portland State University took flavored nicotine liquid made by Halo Cigs, a private company, and tested it in a personal vaporizer from Innokin. The vaporizer allows consumers to adjust the voltage from 3.3V to 5.0V. The higher the voltage the greater the nicotine kick, but also the greater the amount of formaldehyde. . E-cigarette liquids typically contain propylene glycol, which when heated is known to release formaldehyde gas. “Vaping” at high voltage also produced formaldehyde-containing compounds known as hemiacetals, the researchers found. . Formaldehyde inhaled as a gas been associated with an increased risk of leukemia and nasopharyngeal cancer, which affects the upper part of the throat behind the nose. . It is not known exactly where formaldehyde contained in hemiacetals gets deposited in the body or whether it is similarly toxic, said James Pankow, one of the study’s authors.         . “There has never been a cancer study with hemiacetals,” Pankow said in an interview. . Absent such a study, the authors estimated the formaldehyde-related cancer risk associated with e-cigarettes by extrapolating from data on formaldehyde in cigarettes. . They concluded that the life-time risk of developing formaldehyde-related cancer at roughly 1 in 200 for high-voltage e-cigarettes versus 1 in 1,000 for cigarettes - at least five times higher. They found no increased risk for people vaping at a low voltage. . Dr. Neal Benowitz, a nicotine expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said the study could prove useful to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as it prepares to regulate e-cigarettes, potentially including limits on formaldehyde. . But he questioned the legitimacy of comparing the effect of formaldehyde delivered in a cigarette to that delivered via hemiacetal, in droplet form, in an e-cigarette. The effect on organs could be entirely different, he said.  . Other critics said that in the real world most “vapers” do not push the voltage to the levels seen in the study as the taste would become unpalatable. They also noted that the overall health risk of conventional cigarettes, which contain 70,000 toxins in addition to formaldehyde, is far greater than any formaldehyde risk associated with e-cigarettes. . “Lifelong smokers face a greater than 1 in 2 chance of dying from smoking-related diseases, including a roughly 1 in 10 chance of dying from lung cancer,” said Jed Rose, director of the Center for Smoking Cessation at Duke University Medical Center. . Pankow conceded that the study could have contained more context about overall relative risk, but said the authors “just wanted to get it out.” . They submitted it to the NEJM in the form of a letter, which a spokeswoman for the journal said was peer-reviewed. Pankow said letters tend to be less detailed than other studies. . David Abrams, executive director of the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at the anti-tobacco group Legacy, said he was concerned the study would be taken out of context “in the worst possible way.”  . For most vapers who use e-cigarettes as intended, he said, the findings show “there are non-detectable levels of formaldehyde ... which means people can use them to help them quit smoking lethal cigarettes.” |Wed Jan 21 22:26:04 +0000 2015||Ramping up e-cigarette voltage produces more formaldehyde: study |5.5802777618036326e+17|http://reut.rs/1uuITJd
Laura Zuckerman|SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - Idaho officials said avian flu was confirmed in backyard chickens in the southwest of the state on Wednesday as Washington state quarantined poultry and eggs in areas where the virus was detected in chickens, geese and ducks. . The highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian flu was first found in Pacific Northwest states in December, when U.S. officials confirmed the existence of that strain, and of a separate one in northern Washington state near its border with Canada, where H5N2 has killed thousands of birds.  . The virus is fatal for domestic birds like chickens and for two types of falcons that contracted it while in captivity. But it does not appear to affect wild birds such as ducks, which carry and spread it through feces or other means, said Mark Drew of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. . There have been no human illnesses associated with the detection of H5N2 or any other strains of the ailment, and such viruses have not been found in commercial poultry, state and federal agriculture officials said. . The cases coincide with the winter’s southern migration of wild waterfowl, which if infected can pass the virus to domestic birds via feces, or when they are killed and fed to raptors such as captive gyrfalcons and peregrine falcons, Drew said. . Agriculture officials in Idaho quarantined a flock of backyard chickens in Canyon County this week after several birds sickened and died. Another 25 birds were euthanized. . The H5N2 strain also was confirmed in southwest Idaho in the deaths of three falcons that were part of a private, non-commercial flock that has since been quarantined, officials said. . The detection this week in Washington state of the flu strain in backyard chickens, geese and ducks in a flock 125 miles northwest of Seattle was the third outbreak in recent weeks in that state and prompted its second quarantine. . Washington’s initial quarantine went into effect earlier this month in the southeastern part of the state, where H5N2 was found in two flocks of mixed poultry. . The practice of keeping backyard poultry has grown in popularity in the Pacific Northwest in recent years and federal and state agriculture agencies are cautioning bird owners to keep their flocks away from migratory birds. . The cases of avian influenza led China last week to ban all imports of U.S. poultry products and eggs. |Wed Jan 21 22:26:03 +0000 2015||Idaho confirms avian flu cases as Washington imposes new quarantine |5.5802777291720704e+17|http://reut.rs/1xZ3DDt
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – Since the late 1990s, almost 30 percent more adults age 65 and older are likely to say they have had a recent fall, according to a new study. . The rise – from 28 percent of seniors reporting a fall in 1998, to 36 percent in 2010 – may be due in part to increased awareness of fall risks, but it is not just a result of the population aging, study authors say. . “Initially, I presumed our findings would just be due to the fact the older adult population itself is aging and there are more 80 and 90 year-olds, but when we looked at the data closely, it turned out there was increased self-reporting of falls across all ages,” said Dr. Christine Cigolle at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, who led the study. . “So we looked at individual ages - 65, 66, 67, etcetera, and there was an increase in reporting of falls across all ages from about 65 into the late 80s, and in fact it was somewhat more marked in the ‘young old’ versus the ‘oldest old,’” Cigolle told Reuters Health in an interview. . Falling is the most common cause of injury among older adults, and other research also shows that about one of every three older Americans falls each year, Cigolle and her colleagues write in JAMA Internal Medicine. . For their study, Cigolle’s team analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large survey of middle-aged and older Americans conducted every two years. The researchers looked at surveys done from 1998 to 2010 and tallied participants’ reports of having fallen at any time in the period between surveys. . In the 1998 survey, 28.2 percent of seniors reported a fall in the past two years. That percentage steadily rose until 2010, when 36 percent reported a fall. But the increase was almost exclusively among seniors younger than 85, the authors note. . Cigolle noted that the findings were not influenced by gender, income, specific diseases or disability. “This increased self-reporting of falls was fairly pervasive across all categories, we didn’t find an easy answer to explain why older adults are saying they’re falling more,” she said. . “It could be that older adults are more aware of falling,” Cigolle said. “There have been different awareness campaigns and interventions to make older adults aware so it may be in part due to better self-reporting on the part of older adults.” . It could also be that older adults are engaging in riskier behaviors than in the past and participating in activities that make it more likely for them to fall, she added. . A third possibility is that aggressive medical management of conditions and diseases such as hypertension and heart disease may be contributing to fall risk, Cigolle said. . “Physicians can be pretty aggressive with medications and certainly there are many medications that can affect different aspects of mobility and we know can lead to increased falling,” she said. . “What it really was saying was that universally, patients that are 65 to 89 years old are really at a higher risk for falls,” said Dr. Jessica Zwerling, a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. . “Most of us really have the idea that it’s only the oldest old that will fall, but actually in this study it was the opposite, that it’s universal to no age, no demographic and no disease correlates, so it’s a very important study,” said Zwerling, who is assistant director of the Einstein Center for the Aging Brain and was not involved in the new study. . Zwerling said the study emphasizes the importance of identifying patients who may be at a risk for falling at an earlier age, in order to prevent falls.  . It’s also important to get checked by a doctor after you’ve fallen, she said. “As we get older the brain can get smaller, so the bridging veins can have small bleeds and patients may need to be screened cognitively with an examination as well as imaging to look for subtle chronic subdural hematomas that can interfere with walking and cognition and cause chronic complaints,” she said. . Zwerling noted that after falling, patients may develop a fear of falling again, and that fear actually becomes a risk factor for future falls. . She added that it’s important to think about safety, such as making sure areas are well lit, using higher toilet seats and identifying other risk factors around the home. . Cigolle also encouraged older adults and their families to be aware of things about the environment that could lead to falls, slips and trips, such as throw rugs and furniture that might block walking pathways. She also suggests speaking with physicians about any medications that might increase the older person’s risk of falling. . SOURCE:  .

|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Schools in Sierra Leone will reopen in March, the West African nation’s government said on Wednesday, eight months after students were sent home and classes shuttered following the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. . The reopening of schools is another sign the tide may be turning against the outbreak, the worst on record, as infections and the spread of the virus is gradually brought under control.  . The outbreak has killed about 8,626 people in the three worst-hit West African nations - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - and infected nearly 21,700 people, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. . Sierra Leone’s government said in a statement that the decision to reopen schools, one area of life badly hit by the outbreak, was made after a consultative meeting chaired by President Ernest Bai Koroma on Wednesday. . It added that facilities would be provided to ensure that students and teachers were safe. . “We are planning to make sure our schools are safe and disinfected so that we can get back our children to school,” said the education minister, Dr Minkailu Bah. . He said teachers would be trained to use thermometers to take the temperatures of pupils and other staff members, and chlorinated water buckets will be made available in all schools. . Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids, and one of the early symptoms of the disease is a fever. . Bah said that school fees would be subsidised for all pupils in secondary schools to help parents and the ministry would also provide teaching and learning materials. . The head of Britain’s Ebola Task Force in Sierra Leone, Donal Brown, called for a proper risk assessment and the state of the disease and conditions on the ground before schools reopen.  . Several schools throughout the country are currently being used as Ebola care centres to treat patients. |Wed Jan 21 21:54:27 +0000 2015||Sierra Leone to reopen schools in March as Ebola infections slow |5.5801982156538675e+17|http://reut.rs/1xYW2op
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters Health) – Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities have their own specific needs when it comes to health and medicine, according to experts. . Yet LGBT people often avoid seeking medical care because they’re afraid they might face discrimination or that doctors might not understand their special health needs, said Barbara Warren, an expert on LGBT health and health policy, speaking at a discussion on LGBT health sponsored by the Thomson Reuters Pride At Work chapter in New York City on January 15. . Or they may seek medical care, but not “come out” to their healthcare providers.  . Does it matter if healthcare providers know whether a patient is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender? Yes, said Warren, who is director of LGBT Programs and Policies in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. . Warren said LGBT health concerns should be discussed for several reasons. . First, people will have better health outcomes if they feel comfortable with their providers. Additionally, the LGBT community suffers from the stress of being a minority, which can impact people’s health. And certain clinical issues are different in the LGBT community. . For example, she said, members of the LGBT communities – especially lesbian and bisexual women - may be at an increased risk for some cancers and conditions if they don’t get regular healthcare. . “We do know that a percentage of LGBT people avoid and delay screening and care because of fear about or experience of stigma, discrimination or simply lack of knowledge about LGBT people and their health amongst providers,” said Warren. “If you avoid or delay screening and care and you have an issue that may be precancerous, by the time you get into screening and care you’re there because it has become acute and you already have a progressed disease.” . “All of those are factors that go into why it’s important both for your providers to be trained and sensitive and to get it, and why it’s important for you to come out to your providers as who you are and be as open as you can be,” Warren said. . She said the National LGBT Cancer Network advocates training providers to be sensitive in helping a person come out and to do all the screenings that are necessary. . While estimates vary, a 2014 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about 97 percent of U.S. adults identify as straight, about 2 percent as gay or lesbian and about 1 percent as bisexual. . The LGBT community also faces an increased burden of mental health concerns, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse - but this doesn’t mean LGBT people are inherently mentally ill, Warren said. . Instead, she said, LGBT mental health issues are largely related to the stresses of belonging to a minority group. “We can change that by changing the way the world perceives, treats and includes LGBT people.” . Kellan Baker, also speaking at the Thomson Reuters event, said there has been a lot of progress on U.S. policy issues regarding LGBT health. . “We have seen an incredible explosion of initiatives that are inclusive of or focusing on LGBT communities from the federal government over the last five years,” said Baker, a senior fellow with the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C. . He highlighted Healthy People 2020, which lists the nation’s objectives on health and includes a topic area specific to LGBT health.  . Also, Baker said, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - better known as Obamacare - “has a lot to offer LGBT community members. One of the biggest things is simply the expansion of health insurance coverage.” . Baker said access to coverage ties into many of the topics Warren mentioned, such as getting screened for certain conditions and seeing a healthcare provider on a regular basis. . However, more work is needed to connect LGBT people with the information they need to get health insurance and access to healthcare, he said.|Wed Jan 21 21:15:54 +0000 2015||LGBT health concerns need special attention: experts |5.58010119158784e+17|http://reut.rs/1xYL1n3
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) – Although pediatric high cholesterol levels in the U.S. have gone down since 1999, about one in 10 kids still has high blood pressure, according to a new study. . By 2012, approximately 20 percent of U.S. kids ages 8 to 17 had unhealthy cholesterol levels, and 10 percent had hypertension or borderline hypertension. . These measures tend to track from childhood into adulthood, and in adults they are associated with heart problems and death, the authors note in the introduction to their JAMA Pediatrics report.  . “Our research suggests there were modest improvements in blood cholesterol levels and stable blood pressure levels among children between 1999 and 2012,” lead author Dr. Brian K. Kit told Reuters Health. . “Because cholesterol levels and blood pressure in childhood are associated with cholesterol levels and blood pressure in adulthood, changes during childhood may have long-term significance,” said Kit, who is with the U.S. Public Health Service at the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Maryland. . For the new study, Kit and his colleagues used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, which includes direct measurements of fat and cholesterol in the blood and blood pressure readings, from seven surveys between 1999 and 2012. . The analysis looked at blood cholesterol data and blood pressure readings for about 1,500 kids ages eight to 18. . In the most recent survey, conducted in 2011-2012, some 20 percent of the kids had an “adverse lipid concentration” - meaning they had high total cholesterol, high bad cholesterol or low good cholesterol. Eleven percent had high or borderline-high blood pressure readings, based on cutoff points for the child’s sex, age and height. . Unhealthy cholesterol levels had become a little less common since the 1999 survey. For example, in 1999 just over 10 percent of kids had high total cholesterol, which fell to 7.8 percent in 2012. . There were also fewer kids with high blood pressure over the decade, a decrease from 3 percent to 1.6 percent. But the number of kids with borderline high blood pressure remained steady, and when the borderline and high categories were lumped together, these too were steady from 1999 to 2012. . “Cholesterol levels and blood pressure are influenced by many factors including diet, physical activity and exposure to smoke,” Kit told Reuters Health by email.  . The study didn’t explore why rates of unhealthy cholesterol and blood pressure had declined or plateaued. And Kit noted that complications from those conditions are uncommon during childhood.  . But, he emphasized, screening and prevention in kids and teens is important to prevent these important heart disease risk factors form persisting into adulthood.  . Bernard Rosner, professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, noted that in a similar study he conducted, almost twice as many kids qualified for high blood pressure because he used blood pressure standards based on healthy-weight children.  . The new study, in which he was not involved, used standards based on a combination of healthy-weight and overweight children, Rosner noted. . Rosner also cautioned that the demographics of the NHANES survey sample may have changed over time, which might explain some of the shifts in rates of adverse cholesterol or blood pressure. . The National Institutes of Health have issued guidance for pediatricians to help kids with high cholesterol or high blood pressure improve their diets or physical activity or for prescribing medications for them, Kit said. .

|SEATTLE (Reuters) - Washington state’s top lawyer was set to unveil legislation on Wednesday seeking to raise the legal smoking age to 21 from 18 in a move that could make the state the first in the nation with such a threshold, his office said. . Attorney General Bob Ferguson will announce the bill later on Wednesday in Olympia, the state capital, his office said. . “The drive behind this is the health and well-being of our youth in the state of Washington,” spokesman Peter Lavallee said. “Some other jurisdictions have raised the age and seen some real impact on youth smoking rates.” . Consumers age 18 and up can buy cigarettes in many U.S. states, with four states – Alabama, Alaska, New Jersey and Utah – selling to those ages 19 and older, Lavallee said. Some cities and counties, including New York City and Hawaii County, have already raised the smoking age to 21, he said. . Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths, or one of every five deaths, each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . The U.S. West has lower smoking prevalence rates than other U.S. regions, at 14.2 percent, according to 2012 census data. The rate in the Midwest stands at 26 percent, the South at 19.7 percent and the Northeast at 16.5 percent, the CDC said. . In Washington state, where voters in 2012 opted to legalize recreational marijuana for adults age 21 and older, elected officials can propose legislation and seek the backing of state lawmakers. |Wed Jan 21 19:18:49 +0000 2015||Washington state attorney general seeks to raise smoking age to 21 |5.579806566813532e+17|http://reut.rs/1utPZ0A
Janice Neumann|(Reuters Health) – A large study that tracked thousands of nurses over decades suggests many years of night-shift work may raise a woman’s risk of dying from heart disease or certain cancers. . The women on rotating night shifts for six years and longer were 19-23 percent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease and 11 percent more likely to die of any cause than those with little or no night-shift work. Women with 15 years or more on rotating night shifts also had a 25 percent increased risk of lung cancer death. . “I think the important message in this study is really the longer you work rotating night shifts in your career, your risks for developing cardiovascular disease or cancer increase,” said Carol Landis, an expert in sleep and health at the University of Washington School of Nursing in Seattle.   . “If you think about it, it’s really minimal exposure (only three or more rotating shifts in a month),” Landis, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health. . Past research has tied late-night work hours to increased risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The authors of the new study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine also point to observed associations between night shifts and high blood pressure, chronic fatigue, sleep problems and excess weight. . The body’s circadian “clock” system is believed to influence many aspects of health, and the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin is thought to have antitumor effects, the authors note. So it’s plausible that night shift hours could disrupt melatonin and disturb systems that control heart rate, inflammation and metabolism of blood sugar and fats, they write. . “I became interested in studying the health impact of night work on health during my residency and clinical fellowship, when I began to suffer from near-to-constant sleep deprivation and feeling jet-lagged,” said the study’s senior author Dr. Eva Schernhammer of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “Simultaneously, I observed the many different health issues my colleagues who worked rotating night shifts had to cope with.” . Schernhammer’s team used data from the Nurses’ Health Study, and included nearly 75,000 female registered nurses in their analysis. The researchers followed the women from 1988 to 2010, at which point 14,181 women had died.  . The team then looked at the women’s weight, diets, lifestyles and other factors as well as their causes of death.  . Overall, women who worked rotating night shifts for longer periods were older (mean age 66) and heavier, but more physically active than others. They were also more likely to smoke and less likely to take postmenopausal hormones or multivitamins. They tended to drink less alcohol and eat less daily cereal fiber and were more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. . Among women who had done 15 or more years of night shifts at least three nights per month, there were 1,430 deaths, 364 from cardiovascular disease and 506 from cancers (150 from lung cancer).   . “We examined overall mortality in these women, and observed significantly higher overall mortality, as well as higher mortality from cardiovascular disease in women with several years of rotating night shift work, compared to nurses who had never worked night shifts,” Schernhammer said in an email. . The results held even after they were adjusted for weight, smoking and other factors that might explain the link between shift work and disease. . Landis pointed out that one limitation of the study was that all the nurses were married, so the results might not be applicable to younger, single women. . “What really struck me about the study was it’s a really large sample and they did a very nice job of controlling variables, so the risk even though it’s modest, is over and above what other risk factors exist,” Landis said. . Women who need to work night shifts should avoid smoking cigarettes, be sure to eat a nutritional diet high in fiber and reduce light exposure when they get off work in the morning, Landis said. . “So if they wear dark glasses, even if the sun is not out, if they take melatonin, that’s shown to be very good for helping night shift workers to sleep during the day . . . they should really follow a very specific schedule and probably better to not go to sleep right away and be sure to get at least six to eight hours of sleep,” she said. .

|(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novartis AG’s injectable drug, Cosentyx, to treat adults with a moderate to severe skin disease called plaque psoriasis. . Cosentyx was approved on Wednesday with a medication guide warning about a greater risk of infection as it affects the immune system. . Psoriasis is a skin condition caused by dysfunction of the immune system. Patients with plaque psoriasis, the most common form of the disease, develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales.  . The active ingredient in Cosentyx, secukinumab, is part of an eagerly anticipated class of drugs that have shown unprecedented success in treating psoriasis by targeting the inflammation-causing protein interleukin-17 (IL-17). . An advisory panel to the FDA unanimously recommended approval for the injectable biologic, or protein-based drug cultured from living cells, in October.  . Novartis’ drug will soon face competition from rival IL-17 inhibitors. . Eli Lilly and Co will begin marketing its IL-17 inhibitor ixekizumab in the first half of 2015, while Amgen Inc and AstraZeneca Plc’s brodalumab reported positive results from a late-stage trial in May. . Another class of biologics called tumor necrosis factor blockers — including Amgen’s blockbuster Enbrel and AbbVie Inc’s Humira — are widely used in psoriasis but have potentially serious side effects. |Wed Jan 21 18:04:41 +0000 2015||FDA approves Novartis's psoriasis drug |5.579619985549025e+17|http://reut.rs/1xXSz9S
|YANGON (Reuters) - An international medical group has resumed work in an area of northwest Myanmar after a nine-month government ban on its presence in one of the poorest parts of the country over allegations of bias. . Médecins Sans Frontières-Holland (MSF) said Tuesday it was allowed to resume work on Dec. 17 in Rakhine State, where it has provided health and emergency assistance since 1992. . The government ordered the international medical group out of Rakhine in February 2014 after the group said it had treated people it believed were victims of sectarian violence. . The government denied an attack had taken place and accused MSF of being biased in favor of members of the minority Muslim Rohingya community. . Aid groups have drawn the ire of some Buddhists who accuse them of favoring the Rohingya. Humanitarian groups reject accusations of bias in favor of Muslims. . Almost 140,000 of Myanmar’s 1.1 million Rohingya, most of whom of whom are stateless, remain displaced after deadly clashes with Buddhists in Rakhine in 2012. . The withdrawal of the agency, which had operated in the area for more than 20 years, left half a million Rohingya without access to reliable medical care. . “We hope to continue this dialogue with the authorities to ensure that those who need it most in Rakhine state are able to access the healthcare they need,” Martine Flokstra, MSF Myanmar operational adviser in Amsterdam, said in a statement.  . The organization said that since restarting its clinics last month, it had done more than 3,480 consultations, mostly with people with diarrhea, respiratory infections, and chronic conditions. . MSF is the largest provider of HIV/AIDS care in Myanmar, currently treating more than 35,000 HIV patients nationwide, as well as 3,000 people for tuberculosis.  |Wed Jan 21 16:39:19 +0000 2015||MSF resumes work in Myanmar state after government ban |5.579405160008909e+17|http://reut.rs/1xXuwrq
David Morgan|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hip and knee replacements, two of the fastest-growing U.S. medical procedures, are subject to huge - and apparently random - price variations within the same geographical areas, a new insurance industry study said on Wednesday. . The study by Blue Cross Blue Shield [BCBSFL.UL] health insurers adds to the evidence of massive disparities between what different hospitals and medical practices charge in the world’s most expensive healthcare system.  . It examined claims in 64 healthcare markets over three years and found the biggest price swings for hip surgery in Massachusetts, where the same type of care varied by more than 313 percent, from a low of $17,910 to a high of $73,987. . The biggest gaps in total knee replacement surgery appeared in Dallas, Texas, where prices varied 267 percent from $16,772 to $61,584, according to researchers. . Nationwide, typical knee and hip replacements cost an average of just over $30,000, the study found. Both procedures ranged as low as $11,300 in Alabama. But while the price of knee replacements soared to more than $69,000 in New York City, hip surgery climbed even further, to nearly $74,000, in Boston. . The study, which looked at claims for more than 53,000 procedures from 2010 to 2013, underscores the inconsistencies in medical pricing at a time when employers are increasingly shifting healthcare costs to workers through high-deductible insurance plans. . Researchers described the variations as “seemingly random” and said the data demonstrated the need for transparent pricing in medicine.  . “Extreme price variation in healthcare can have obvious financial consequences for individuals and employers,” the study’s authors said. “And from a macroeconomic perspective, it can have serious implications for the sustainability of (the) U.S. healthcare system.” . Researchers also noted that a lack of price variation can penalize consumers in markets where prices are consistently high, such as Fort Collins, Colorado, where knee replacements exceeded the national average by nearly $25,000 but varied locally by less than 1 percent.   . Data contained in the study reflects money that insurers and patients paid to hospitals, doctors, labs, physical therapists and others involved in procedures that are expected to increase as the U.S. population continues to age.            . The study cited independent research estimating that knee replacements tripled and hip replacements doubled between 1993 and 2009. General spending on healthcare is expected to grow 5.7 percent annually over the next decade as health coverage expands under the Affordable Care Act, according to government forecasters. |Wed Jan 21 16:32:18 +0000 2015||U.S. insurance study charts huge price gaps for hip, knee surgery |5.5793875135655936e+17|http://reut.rs/1ut2Yja
Ben Hirschler|DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - United Nations agencies need a final $1 billion to fight West Africa’s deadly Ebola epidemic as experts move to a new phase involving a massive detective operation to trace remaining cases, the U.N. Ebola chief said on Wednesday. . David Nabarro estimated that an overall total of $4 billion in new money, equivalent to all the aid committed so far, was needed by relief agencies and the worst affected countries themselves to end the epidemic and “help these countries to get back to the economic trajectory they had”. . The unprecedented outbreak has so far killed more than 8,400 people, overwhelmingly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and the international response has included balance of payments and military support as well as medical help. . So far, U.N. bodies have received around $1 billion, two-thirds of a target set last year. Nabarro, who heads the U.N. response, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the World Food Programme now needed the same amount again. . Although the rate of infection is slowing, experts in Davos said tracking down remaining cases so that the disease cannot flare up again will be a major task. . Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain’s Wellcome Trust international medical charity, said the epidemic would have “a long and bumpy tail”. . A priority for the next few months will be scaling up efforts to trace all the contacts of infected people. Nabarro said that would require perhaps 1,000 epidemiologists, since there are still around 50 micro-outbreaks in the region: . “I can’t say how long it will take, but it is that last part of getting down to zero that might be the most difficult.” . Drugmakers and research institutions are meanwhile racing to develop Ebola vaccines, which could yet have a role to play in protecting healthcare workers and other at-risk groups, depending on how much longer the epidemic lingers. |Wed Jan 21 15:33:35 +0000 2015||U.N.

Emma Farge|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Here at the front line of the Ebola epidemic, the tide seems to be turning against the disease.  . A military-style operation to fight the outbreak in Sierra Leone - the worst-affected country - has helped to dramatically reduce new cases, in what health officials say is a major step towards defeating Ebola. . Since it was launched about one month ago, the drive has doubled the number of ambulances for patients in the densely populated west of a country where more than 3,000 people have died. . Police halt vehicles at checkpoints in the tumble-down streets to check temperatures, while posters proclaim in the local Krio language: “Togeda we go stop ebola.” . Aid workers also report success in changing behavior in rural areas, notably discouraging people from burial rituals involving direct contact with the dead - a major source of transmission. . As a result, transmission of the hemorrhagic fever has slowed sharply in the West African country, which has recorded more than 10,000 cases since May. There were just 184 new cases in the week to Jan. 11 - the lowest in five months.   . More than half of beds in treatment centers across Sierra Leone are now empty - a stark contrast from a peak in November when centers in Freetown overflowed, patients waited days for ambulances and bodies were unburied, or interred secretly in backyards.    . This has prompted President Ernest Bai Koroma to say he believes his government - helped by the nearly 800 British soldiers and more than $450 million in foreign aid - can stamp out Sierra Leone’s last case by the end of March. . Some health specialists and aid workers are more cautious.  . They hope the success in Freetown and its environs is a big step towards beating the epidemic - which has killed more than 8,400 people - now that Liberia and Guinea also appear to have stabilized, but are wary of calling the end of an outbreak that last April seemed to wane in Guinea, only to return ferociously. . “The Sierra Leone problem is turning the corner. I think we’ll get close to zero there by March so long as there are no surprises,” said Philippe Maughan, senior Ebola operations manager at ECHO, the European Commission’s humanitarian aid branch.  . “But ... there will be cases popping up here and there over the next six months to a year and we’ll need to snuff them out.” . United Nations Ebola chief David Nabarro told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that U.N. agencies needed a final $1 billion to fight the epidemic in West Africa. . The National Ebola Response Centre (NERC), a new military-style body chaired by Koroma, launched “Operation Western Area Surge” last month in Sierra Leone - a country of six million people where the main industries are fishing and farming but which has huge, largely untapped, mineral reserves. . A jingle is played repeatedly over loud speakers at the command center: “Ebola go, we don’t tire!” . Freetown’s main Kingtom cemetery has been expanded and highly contagious bodies are buried in deep graves within 24 hours according to strict protocols to prevent transmission.  . Burials are important in West African culture, with mourners often touching the corpse in intimate, spiritual farewells to their loved ones. Ebola spreads via contact with bodily fluids of infected people or with corpses of someone killed by it. . The Ebola center has noted pockets of resistance in the capital, which officials attribute to mistrust of authorities due to the weak response before the surge. . In one home in the Devil Hole neighborhood outside Freetown where a nine-year-old boy was taken away by medics, relatives said he caught Ebola from malaria drugs handed out by the government. . “The challenge is this last small group of people who aren’t changing their behavior,” said Joanna Reid, head of Britain’s Department for International Development in Sierra Leone. “That’s the last mile.” . Aid workers say overcoming misperceptions and changing behavior was critical to breaking transmission chains in rural hotspots like Kailahun, where case counts have fallen to zero. The same must now happen in Freetown, they say. . David Heymann, head of Britain’s Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security, said both current success and future progress is largely due to communication. . “They’ve finally got strong communication ... probably through traditional leaders and others who are helping communities understand how to prevent transmission. From my past experience with outbreaks, when communities learn how to communicate the risks and how to prevent infection, the outbreak stops - it’s as simple as that.” . Some are taking matters into their own hands, such as Ebola survivor Mohamed Mansaray, 61, who lost six family members to the virus in the fishing village of John Thorpe on the outskirts of Freetown.  . “People were attributing the deaths to witchcraft, that’s why people died,” Mansaray said, sitting on a bench beneath a mango tree. Calling himself an “Ebola Evangelist”, he goes from house to house trying to educate locals about the disease. . In a sign of change, John Thorpe residents are starting to hand over the sick to a new center built by charity Oxfam.         . It has proved harder to change attitudes in Freetown than in rural areas, despite a high case density there of one in around 300 people – a factor that would normally increase awareness. . A November survey showed less than half of respondents in and around Freetown had comprehensive knowledge of Ebola - the nation’s lowest level.  . “In Freetown, many live roaming lives so the possibility of transmitting correct messages is lower than in rural districts,” said British anthropologist Paul Richards, who has 30 years of experience in Sierra Leone. . He said some people resisted because stopping transmission involved attacking key cultural values: “You have to abandon some of the basic features of being a good person - visiting the sick and doing the decent thing for the dead.”  . In a positive sign, the percentage of corpses picked up by burial teams around Freetown testing positive for Ebola has dropped below 10 percent, from 30 percent before the surge, as families report suspected cases for treatment earlier. . There is still much to be done. There is not yet a central database of Ebola contacts and there are only nine contacts for each Ebola case, versus an average of 10-15 for Liberia. . Even if contacts are established, officials often get lost searching a country with no postcodes and where street numbers are often not sequential.     . Speaking from the NERC situation room, a converted court room used to try criminals from the 1991-2002 civil war, its director OB Sisay says a key challenge is deploying resources quickly.  . NERC needs approval from partners like the World Bank to allocate budgets - a safeguard against embezzlement. . “Let’s say I need food to quarantine a community. It can take two weeks,” said Sisay in an interview interrupted every few minutes by demands from medics and local chiefs.  . Since Guinea’s outbreak began in December 2013, officials have become aware Ebola can rear up from a single imported case, as occurred in Mali in October. . President Koroma now wants to decentralize the Ebola response to handle isolated rural cases. But in a densely-forested country where less than 10 percent of roads are paved, it’s hard to get patients in the “wet phase” - vomiting and sometimes bleeding from the eyes and ears - into care. . “We are getting there,” said Karline Kleijer, operations manager for Medicins Sans Frontieres in Sierra Leone. “Major steps have been made, but we still have a long way to go.” |Wed Jan 21 15:33:35 +0000 2015||On Ebola front line, first glimpse of end to epidemic |5.5792397312066765e+17|http://reut.rs/1usMYOd
Kate Kelland|LONDON (Reuters) - The chemical bisphenol A, used to stiffen some plastic food containers, poses no health risk to consumers of any age, including unborn children, at current levels of exposure, Europe’s food safety watchdog said on Wednesday. . Some studies have suggested possible links to everything from cancer to heart disease to infertility to kidney and liver problems, prompting European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to re-evaluate the potential risks of BPA. . BPA belongs to a broad class of compounds called endocrine disruptors. It is found in plastics used to make food containers, bottles and coatings in tin cans, and is also commonly used in thermal paper in cash register receipts. . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPA from baby bottles in 2012, but said there was not enough evidence for a wider ban and has found the chemical safe at low levels. . The EFSA acknowledged in its assessment that BPA residues could migrate into foods and drinks and be ingested by consumers, and that BPA from thermal paper, cosmetics and dust could be either inhaled or absorbed through the skin.  . But it found that exposure to BPA was “considerably under” the safe level known as the “tolerable daily intake”, or TDI. . It said that after weighing up “a significant body of new scientific information on its toxic effects”, EFSA’s expert panel concluded that high doses of BPA — hundreds of times above the TDI — were likely to adversely affect the kidney and liver, and might also cause effects animals’ mammary glands. . But at current levels — which it said were often three to five times lower than the TDI of 4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day — it found “no consumer health risk from bisphenol A exposure”. |Wed Jan 21 13:43:23 +0000 2015||BPA plastics chemical poses no health risk, says European watchdog |5.578962415612109e+17|http://reut.rs/1usk4h9
Christina  Farr|SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Texas company that makes brain-training games for children has settled a complaint over unsubstantiated health claims, the U.S. government said on Tuesday. . The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Focus Education claimed in an advertisement and on its website that it could permanently improve a child’s focus, memory and school performance. The company also said its technology had proven to be “highly beneficial” for children with learning impairments such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). . In a statement, the FTC said the company must stop making such claims for products including the Jungle Rangers computer game.  . The FTC said Focus Education generated sales of some $4.5 million between 2012 and mid-2013.  . Focus Education did not respond to an email request for comment.  . It stressed on its website that its game was developed through a collaboration of scientists, researchers, doctors and parents.  . The case was among the first in which the commission has cracked down on an application developer for making unsubstantiated medical claims. Previously, the FTC fined two app developers who falsely claimed that their smartphone apps could treat and cure acne. . Some industry experts believe the FTC will increasingly become the watchdog for the fertile field of mobile health. . “We could well see FTC taking the primary enforcement role,” said Bradley Merrill Thompson, a Washington D.C.-based attorney with the firm Epstein Becker & Green. That the FTC took action, rather than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, represents an important shift, Thompson added. . To avoid federal oversight, app makers should be “precise, accurate and careful” with their marketing claims, said Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology, an organization that represents app developers. |Wed Jan 21 02:28:03 +0000 2015||Brain-training game maker settles with U.S. FTC over unsupported claims |5.577262871132447e+17|http://reut.rs/1uq0q5t
Ronnie Cohen|(Reuters Health) - Exercising the body and mind may be the best way to keep an older brain sharp, suggests a new study. . “The best medicine is physical activity,” lead researcher Ralph Martins told Reuters Health. . “At the end of the day, the two together – physical activity and cognitive training – gave us an additional benefit,” said Martins, who directs the Center of Excellence for Alzheimer’s Disease Research and Care at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia. . Martins and his colleagues studied 172 people from ages 60 to 85 years, assigning them randomly into four groups.  . One group walked three days a week for an hour and did 40 minutes of resistance training twice a week for 16 weeks. Another group did hour-long computer brain-training exercises five days a week, also for 16 weeks. A third group did both the physical exercise and the computer activities. A fourth group maintained their regular routines. . The researchers write in Translational Psychiatry that only the group that engaged in both physical activity and computerized brain training showed significantly improved verbal memory, which helps people remember words and language. . The researchers note that the study failed to show benefits for executive functions that control focus, attention to details and goal setting. They also didn’t find benefits for visual memory, processing speed or attention. . Martins said physical exercise had the most profound and constant effect. . Dr. David Merrill also sees physical activity as the most useful aid to maintaining memory and cognitive ability as people age, but the combination of physical and mental exercise may offer “synergistic” benefits. . “What’s good for the muscular-skeletal system is good for the cardiovascular system, and it’s also good for the brain,” said Merrill, who is a geriatric psychiatrist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. . “Physical exercise sets the stage for the brain to be responsive to new information,” said Merrill, who was not involved with the new study. “You’re all ready to build new synapses, new connections.” . Both Martins and Merrill recommend that older people exercise regularly and stay intellectually involved. Both favor real-life challenges over computerized brain exercises. . Martins urges retirees to join service organizations, like the Rotary Club, and to dance for the physical exercise and mental acuity. . “Full retirement doesn’t make sense for graceful aging,” Merrill said. “People should try to keep working not only to maintain their self-identity but to challenge their brain.” . Merrill said the new research is the most recent of a handful of studies showing that a combination of interventions can help seniors remain mentally alert. . He advocates building up to more strenuous exercise than people did in the study. . “There’s lots of data that shows that being physically active is good for the brain,” he said. “It’s almost so intuitive that it defies logic that so few people are active physically.” . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that older adults perform moderate and vigorous aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week. . SOURCE: .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters Health) – Smartphone fitness applications aim to change people’s behaviors, but often without the most effective tools, a new study shows. . “Behavior change techniques are the tools that have emerged out of decades-old research on behavior change which have shown some level of effectiveness at helping people to modify their behavior,” said David Conroy, the study’s lead researcher from Northwestern University in Chicago. . The “app space” is “exploding,” Conroy said in a phone call. “There are new apps coming out every week, even every day, and I think it would be really hard to tell which one you want to use if you were a consumer.” . More than half of American adults own smartphones - and half of those owners use some type of fitness app, Conroy and colleagues wrote in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. . But, Conroy said, for the vast majority of these apps, there is no research on their effectiveness. One way to start that evaluation would be to look at what types of behavior-changing techniques the apps use. . In November 2013, Conroy and colleagues identified the 100 top-selling health and fitness apps in the Apple iTunes and Google Play marketplaces. Half were free; the other half were available for a fee. . The researchers looked for any of 93 possible behavior-changing techniques in the apps, including social support, instructions, demonstration, feedback, goal settings, prompt and self-monitoring of behavior. . Altogether, the apps used 39 behavior change techniques. Each app had from one to 21 techniques, with an average around seven per app. . The study team discovered that apps generally fell into two categories. About 48 percent focused on support and feedback through social support, approval from others and feedback on behavior. The other 52 percent offered support and education through social support, approval from others, demonstrations and instructions. . “It seems like almost all of the apps now are trying to find ways to help connect with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram,” Conroy said. “They want people to have a social connection.” . The study shows that social media integration is pervasive, Conroy said, even though there is only limited research showing social media can positively affect behavior. . The researchers only looked at what techniques were include with each app, they did not test whether or not any of the apps were effective in helping people become or stay more physically active. . Sherry Pagoto, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, said in a phone interview that the range of behavior change strategies being used in health-related mobile apps is narrow compared to what’s used in clinical practice. . “So I think (there’s) just so much more room to grow when it comes to these health apps,” said Pagoto, who wasn’t involved with the new study. “They don’t really seem to reflect the behavioral sciences and what we know about behavior change.” . Pagoto said the good news is there are some evidence-based strategies in some of these apps, but app developers could do more. . Conroy said that while some apps have more behavior change techniques than others, none of them are silver bullets. They shouldn’t replace the guidance of fitness and health professionals. . “A lot of these apps, it turns out, are kind of hollow,” he said, adding they look nice and have many features, but no techniques to motivate people who aren’t currently active. .

Victoria Cavaliere|SEATTLE (Reuters) - A third outbreak of avian flu has been detected in Washington state, prompting agriculture officials on Tuesday to warn bird owners to keep their flocks away from migratory birds that have spread viruses from Oregon to British Columbia. . State and federal agriculture officials culled about 120 backyard chickens, geese and ducks in Clallam County, 125 miles (200 km) northwest of Seattle, on Sunday after confirmed infections of the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian flu. . “All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, need to continue practicing good biosecurity, preventing contact between their birds and wild birds and reporting sick birds or unusual bird deaths,” said U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Joelle Hayden. . The virus has not been found in commercial poultry and there was no immediate public health concern, federal agriculture officials said. . Most strains of bird flu viruses do not infect humans, although some strains can be dangerous or deadly.  . In December, the USDA confirmed two separate virus strains of bird flu in Washington’s northern Whatcom County, near the Canadian border, with infections detected in pintail ducks and captive Gyrfalcons that were fed hunter-killed wild birds. . Earlier this month, the Washington State Department of Agriculture imposed an emergency eight-month quarantine of poultry and eggs in parts of Benton and Franklin counties, in the state’s southeast, after the H5N2 strain was found in two flocks of mixed poultry there. . The virus is extremely contagious among poultry and can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 48 hours. The H5N2 strain of bird flu has killed thousands of birds on two Canadian farms in British Columbia. . Last week, China banned all imports of U.S. poultry products and eggs following the discovery of avian influenza in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the USDA said. All poultry shipped to China after Jan. 8 was to be returned or destroyed, the agency said.  |Tue Jan 20 21:35:16 +0000 2015||New outbreak of avian flu found in Washington state |5.5765260576230195e+17|http://reut.rs/1xSW2q6
Randi Belisomo|(Reuters Health) – Researchers will soon be tracking 3,000 senior drivers as part of an unprecedented project to better understand the safety and transportation needs of aging Americans. . The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety is directing $12 million to Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health so researchers there can study driving behavior and health factors affecting older drivers for the next five years.  . This latest phase in the foundation’s Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) project is expected to clarify the effects of risk factors, like prescription drug use and deteriorating vision, on driving. The study will also explore decisions to stop driving, and mobility options for seniors who no longer drive.  . “We honestly don’t feel that if you were to interview traffic safety experts, they would admit that we know enough today about how to absolutely guarantee that we can provide the best guidance services, training and vehicle design to take into consideration limitations older drivers may have,” said Peter Kissinger, CEO of the AAA Foundation.  . This month, five study sites in California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan and New York will begin recruiting drivers between the ages 65 and 79. Their vehicles will be fitted with GPS devices to capture real time driving patterns; the data will let researchers assess maneuvers they make, along with where and when seniors choose to drive. Traffic and accident records will also be followed. Participants must receive yearly medical examinations to measure physical and cognitive functions.  . “It’s a very comprehensive data collection,” said Columbia University epidemiologist Guohua Li, the LongROAD project’s principal investigator. “We want to be ahead of the curve to address emerging issues rather than looking back and relying on retrospective data.” . Little data exists about the relationship between aging and driving safety, and the National Institute on Aging has identified this knowledge gap as a key strategic priority. Study researchers say doctors and families often rely on anecdotal evidence when encouraging older patients or loved ones to stop or limit driving.  . Li says the most critical outcomes of the new study will be assessments of medication impact on driving safety, and evaluations of emerging vehicle technologies that benefit older drivers, like cameras, navigation systems and crash warning signals. . “Seniors need to be protected more in a vehicle,” said Kara Macek of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “Due to their fragility, their bodies are not always able to withstand the same amount of force the older they get.” . Macek said seniors are not poor drivers, as they are often represented to be. In many cases, they may even be more cautious as they make up for other abilities that diminish with age. Teens remain the most over-represented population in vehicle crashes in terms of volume, and until now, they have been the AAA Foundation’s largest investment in research.  . Dr. Alice Pomidor, chair of the American Geriatrics Society Public Education Committee, believes the project will ultimately allow more aging Americans to remain mobile. . “We want to try to let people drive as long as possible, because driving is such a critical component to life in the United States,” Pomidor said. “Getting a car means you have come of age and you are independent. Asking someone to relinquish that is pretty much asking someone to relinquish independence. Many see it as the first step in a long slippery slope to landing in the nursing home.” . Safely staying behind the wheel is often essential to overall health, she said. When seniors relinquish car keys, they often become depressed. Nutrition sometimes suffers, as there is no good way to travel to a grocery store - or to a doctor.  . Participants will receive modest compensation for their five-year commitment and willingness to be tracked on the roads. . “The data collected could be very, very important to senior participants and relevant to their peers,” Li said. “There’s a societal benefit to participation in this project.”|Tue Jan 20 21:35:16 +0000 2015||AAA invests $12 million in study of older drivers’ needs |5.57652604101333e+17|http://reut.rs/1up1qXp
|(Reuters) - Women, higher-income diners and patrons of fast-food restaurants in the Seattle area are more likely to use restaurant calorie count information, according to survey results published on Tuesday.  . The research findings from Washington State’s King County, which includes the city of Seattle, add to a growing body of data on how such disclosures, meant to curb the U.S. obesity epidemic, may influence dining habits. . The study was based on surveys of more than 3,000 King County residents who frequent chain restaurant. It began eight months before the county required restaurants to post calorie information at the beginning of 2009, and continued for two years after that.  . Women, higher-income individuals and diners who ate at fast-food chains said they were the most likely to use the information. White, higher-income and obese customers were more likely to see the calorie information. Researchers did not ask how diners put calorie information to use. . “It was a confirmation that if you post calorie information, more people are going to see it and more people are going to use it,” said Roxana Chen, lead author and social research scientist for public health for Seattle and King County.  . The study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and published online by the American Journal of Public Health. . Chen said the latest study builds on related RWJF-funded research published in 2013. In that study, researchers examined receipts from more than 7,300 King County restaurant customers and found that patrons, particularly women, who saw the calorie counts purchased fewer calories than those who did not.  . King County was the second U.S. jurisdiction, after New York City, to implement a calorie counts under a menu-labeling law.  |Tue Jan 20 21:35:15 +0000 2015||Calorie counts on menus used by women, wealthier diners in Seattle area |5.576526017651016e+17|http://reut.rs/1xSW1T3
Dan Whitcomb|LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Southern California school said on Tuesday it had told students who have not been vaccinated for measles to stay home for two weeks after learning that one of their classmates was infected in an outbreak traced to Disneyland in late December. . Huntington Beach High School, about 15 miles away from Disneyland in Anaheim, California, said that the step had been taken at the direction of the Orange County Health Care Agency following confirmation of measles in a student there. . The high school, which serves nearly 3,000 students in the beachside community, had last week sent a letter to parents warning that the student was infected and urging them to contact a doctor if their child developed symptoms. . School officials said that individuals believed to have been exposed to the infected student had been contacted directly. . “However, measles spreads very easily by air and by direct contact,” Matt Zahn, the agency’s medical director, said in a letter dated Jan. 14. “Simply being in the same room with someone who has measles is sufficient to become infected.” . The school did not specify in a written statement how many unvaccinated students had been asked to stay home, but said classes were continuing on a normal schedule. . California health officials earlier this month linked an outbreak of measles to Disneyland, saying anyone who visited the amusement park in Anaheim between Dec. 15 and 20 may have been exposed.  . The total number of confirmed cases linked to the outbreak has risen to 51 and three suspected cases are being investigated in San Diego County. . Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by the appearance of a red rash that typically starts on the face and spreads downward. The sometimes deadly viral disease can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. . There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within a few weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia. |Tue Jan 20 19:47:24 +0000 2015||Disneyland measles outbreak prompts warning at high school |5.576254604654756e+17|http://reut.rs/1xSpsVe
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - People who are too sedentary, even if they do exercise frequently, are more likely to develop heart disease, cancer and diabetes, a new report says.  . It’s well known that too much sitting time is bad for our health. “What we didn’t know was whether the sitting time and health relationship was because people were also exercising poorly,” said senior author Dr. David Alter of the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute-University Health Network and Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, in a phone interview. . It turns out, he and his colleagues say, that sedentary time and exercise time are two distinct factors when it comes to health outcomes. . “Another way of saying it is just because one does their 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day doesn’t ensure their health,” Alter said. “These are two distinct factors, we need both, we need exercise and need to be sitting less.” . The researchers analyzed 47 studies that tracked groups of people as they reported roughly how much time they spent sitting around and not expending much energy, as well as how often they exercised. . People who were the most sedentary were more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, breast, colon, ovarian and other cancers, and cardiovascular disease than people who spent less time sitting.  . They were also 24 percent more likely to die during the studies than those who spent the least time sitting.  . The pattern tended to be more pronounced for people who also reported less time exercising, the authors reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  But regardless of physical activity level, prolonged sedentary time was independently associated with bad health outcomes. . The studies “all seemed to show a similar result,” Alter said. “There is a strong and consistent link between sitting time and a host of diseases.” . Strategies for encouraging people to sit less are different than those used to promote exercise, he said.  . “There are very simple things we can do, every half an hour get up for two to three minutes,” he said.  “You do that and that’s already nearly an hour less sitting per day.” . Standing burns twice as many calories as sitting, he noted. People can also stand during commercial breaks while watching TV or during the last 15 minutes of a sporting event, he said.  . These strategies don’t replace daily exercise, Alter stressed. . None of the studies in the review were randomized controlled trials, so researchers can’t yet say that sitting directly causes disease, Alter said. . There will need to be considerably more research done to fill in those gaps and help develop guidelines for sedentary behavior, like there are for physical activity, Neville Owen, program head of Behavioral & Generational Change at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, wrote in an editorial published with the study. . Even among adults who meet the public health guideline – that is, they walk at least 30 min a day – “those who sit for prolonged periods have elevated health risk biomarkers,” Owen told Reuters Health by email. “However, there is insufficient evidence yet to know whether very highly active people who sit for prolonged periods are also at risk.” . Regardless, sitting time was most important for nonexercisers, Alter said. . “Those that do not exercise and who sit a lot, the health hazards are accelerated quite markedly,” Alter said. . “If there is a priority population that I tune myself into, it’s the nonexercisers high-sitting-time people.” .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - On any given day, a large proportion of kids and adolescents eat pizza – and on those days, they tend to eat more calories, saturated fat and sodium than they do on other days, according to data collected over the past decade in the U.S. . On pizza eating days, kids ate an average of 83 more calories, and teens had an average of 230 more calories, than on non-pizza days. Kids and teens also got 3 to 5 more grams of saturated fat on pizza days, and 100 to 400 more milligrams of sodium. . “What this is saying is kids are not adequately compensating in other parts of their diet when they eat pizza, and these are nutrients that we want to limit,” lead author Lisa M. Powell told Reuters Health by phone. . Powell, of the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and colleagues analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data on a national sample of kids ages 2 to 19 between 2003 and 2010, and found that calorie intake from pizza actually declined, but was still associated with unhealthier eating days. . “We wanted to answer the question, ‘does it matter that pizza is one of the top contributors to kids’ diets?” said Powell.  . It does matter, since eating pizza adds extra calories and fat to the day for the average kid, she and her colleagues write in Pediatrics. . Youngsters were surveyed about the food they had consumed over the previous 24 hours, twice in a ten-day period. (For small children, parents answered the questions.)  . In the 2009-2010 survey, 20 percent of younger kids and 23 percent of teens ate pizza on any given day. On pizza-eating days, younger kids ate an average of 408 calories worth of pizza and teens ate about 624 calories of pizza, which is actually less than in the 2003-2004 survey year.  . That decline may be because individual kids were eating fewer slices at a time in 2010, or because the pizza itself had gotten slightly healthier, Powell said. . The American Heart Association recommends that kids age four to 18 consume between 1,200 and 2,200 calories per day, depending on their age and gender. . Snack time pizza was associated with the most extra calories, fat and salt, more than pizza eaten for lunch or dinner, the authors found. . “It has quite an adverse effect as a snack,” Powell said. “Not a lot of kids are consuming pizza as a snack, but it’s definitely something they shouldn’t be doing.” . Consumption may be going down, but portion sizes for pizza and Mexican food have both gone up over recent years in the U.S., said Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition and public health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. . “It seems to me actually a worse product than it would have been 15 to 20 years ago,” said Popkin, who was not involved in the new study. . “These are products that you eat only as your meal, and you tend not to eat salad as well,” Popkin told Reuters Health by phone. . Pizza consumption may be on the decline in the U.S., but that is not the case globally, he said. . “If you look at pizza consumption globally, in low and middle income countries the pizza market is really exploding,” he said. . Powell hopes that parents will recognize the role pizza plays in their kids’ diets and that pediatricians together can urge the pizza industry to make their products healthier, perhaps by lowering the saturated fat content. . “That would be a voluntary effort, but hopefully parents can use their pizza dollars to make healthier choices,” she said.  .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - People are more likely to quit smoking, start working out and lose weight if their domestic partner also makes a healthy change, according to a new study of married couples in England. . Couples tend to share unhealthy behaviors, but this is the first time researchers looked at a large population to see if people are more likely to change when they change together, said senior author Jane Wardle of University College London. . Collaborating might make healthy behaviors easier to adopt, and having a partner who does not join in might make it harder, she told Reuters Health by email. . “Of course we weren’t studying ‘why,’ only ‘whether’, but I would speculate that social support and sharing the problem would be good,” Wardle said. “Maybe there might also be an element of competition.” . More than 3,500 married or cohabiting couples over age 50 in England first completed health behavior questionnaires around the year 2000 and have been followed up with subsequent questionnaires and nurse visits. . For smoking couples, only eight percent of men whose partners kept smoking were able to quit. But when partners also gave up smoking, 48 percent of men were successful in their own attempt. The numbers were similar for female smokers. . Almost 70 percent of men increased their physical activity levels when their partners joined them, compared to 26 percent of men whose partners did not. . For weight loss, 15 percent of women managed to lose at least 5 percent of their body weight while their partner did not lose weight, but 36 percent lost their weight if their partners did too. . Odds of success were highest if partners made a change and became newly healthy, rather than if partners were healthy to start with. . However, smokers coupled with nonsmokers were still more likely to quit, and physically inactive people paired with an active person were more likely to get moving, compared to those who were paired with people more similar to themselves, the researchers found. . For people who were overweight, having a healthy-weight partner did not increase their odds of losing weight. But if one overweight partner started to lose weight, the other’s odds of losing weight tripled. . “The partner merely being slim didn’t seem to promote change,” Wardle said. “Perhaps couples can more easily ignore (or accept) differences in weight without feeling any pressure to change; perhaps weight differences aren’t as readily expressed as visible differences in food intake.” . “In contrast, if your husband is a non-smoker (for example) he probably expresses his preference that you don’t smoke, and if he goes exercising he might encourage you to come too,” she said. . “While the paper shows a relationship between couple behaviors, it can’t really isolate why,” Jennifer Roberts said in an email to Reuters Health. Roberts wasn’t involved with the new study but has studied spousal correlations in obesity at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. . Wardle said the results likely apply to same-sex couples as well, but the number included in the current study was too small to test. . “I would certainly recommend doctors to enquire if their patient’s partner ought to be quitting smoking, getting more active, or losing some weight, and if so talk to the patient about whether the two of them might take the change up together,” she said. .

Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters Health) - Kids’ math and reading skills when they start kindergarten can vary greatly based on their social and economic status, according to a new study. . “We knew economic circumstances have an impact on early child development, but it was surprising just how big the reading and math ability gaps really are between children in different socioeconomic status groups by kindergarten entry,” said lead author Kandyce Larson of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.  . Larson and her colleagues studied math and reading test scores for more than 6,000 U.S. kids entering kindergarten in 2006 or 2007.  . The researchers used the kids’ household income, parental occupation and education to divide them into five socioeconomic groups. . Kids in the lowest socioeconomic group scored in an average 34th percentile on the reading test, compared to an average 67th percentile for kids in the highest socioeconomic group, according to results in Pediatrics. . Average math percentiles were 33 in the lowest socieconomic group, compared to 70 in the highest group. . Compared to kids in the higher socioeconomic bracket, those in the lowest tended to have younger mothers, lower average family reading scores, fewer books in the home, and were less likely to have rules about bedtime, food and chores. . These types of home-life factors explained about half of the differences in the kindergarteners’ reading and math ability, the researchers write. . “Families with higher incomes are able to provide a cognitively stimulating environment for their children as they can purchase educational toys, books, and offer variety in the child’s life such as bringing them to museums, as well as purchasing better quality food which will also help their development,” said Orla Doyle, a lecturer in the school of economics at the University College Dublin Geary Institute for Public Policy. . “However, income is also a marker for underlying characteristics within the family,” said Doyle, who was not involved with the new study. “Parents with higher incomes typically have more desirable (traits) such as higher IQ, motivation, persistence, and consciousness,” she told Reuters Health by email.  . Almost all the parents in the highest socioeconomic group expected their four-year-old child to earn a college degree someday, while only 57 percent of parents in the lowest group expected the same. . Parents who plan to send their children to college may establish early routines and practices to reach that goal, Larson said. . She pointed out that access to high-quality preschools, books and home computers is not equal across the socioeconomic spectrum. Neither is knowledge about the importance of early reading. . “The good news,” Larson wrote in an email, is that modifiable factors, like parent reading and preschool attendance, may improve children’s outcomes. . The first five years of life are a critical period for brain development, she said. . “Studies show that cognitive functioning at school entry predicts future educational attainment and health and well-being into adulthood,” Larson said. “This is why it is so important that we intervene early to optimize developmental capacity for all children.” . Interventions targeted at improving the home environment for low socioeconomic families, starting as early as pregnancy, have been effective, Doyle said.  . “Home visiting programs target low socioeconomic families and provide regular home visits delivered by trained professionals, and aim to educate parents about child development and promote positive parenting skills,” she said. . Larson cautioned that several other factors may also contribute to the gap in cognitive ability, but were not measured in this study. . For example, she said, low-income parents may experience obstacles, such as inflexible work schedules that interfere with family routines and participation in childhood programs. . They also did not have information on parental intellectual ability, she noted. . SOURCE: .

Lawrence Hurley|WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd can still benefit from patent protection for top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, dealing a blow to generic drugmakers looking to market a cheaper rival product. . In a 7-2 vote, the justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for further review saying it had not used the correct approach in analyzing whether the patent, due to expire in September 2015, was valid. The appeals court had thrown out the patent in 2013.  . The extended litigation of the case is likely to benefit Israel-based Teva, as it continues to sell Copaxone without competition from generic drugmakers who would offer steep discounts once they enter the market. . In the meantime, Teva is switching MS patients to a new version of Copaxone that is stronger, taken less frequently and has a longer patent life. . “Teva has done a masterful job of preventing a generic formulation of Copaxone and this elongates their swap window to move more patients,” Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert said. “Ultimately there will be a generic version of Copaxone, but it may not be for a while.”   . Two teams are developing generic forms of Copaxone: one involving Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit and Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc and another involving Mylan Inc and Natco Pharma Ltd. . “We will continue to explore all available avenues to protect our intellectual property for Copaxone,” Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman said in a statement. . The legal question considered by the Supreme Court was to what extent the appeals court has leeway to second-guess findings made by district court judges about patent claim construction. Teva had argued that the appeals court should have deferred to a district court judge, who had previously ruled in the company’s favor. . In an opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court said that the appeals court must defer to the federal district judge unless there is evidence of “clear error.” The appeals court used the wrong legal analysis in making its ruling, he said. . “A district court judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entirety of a proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain that familiarity than an appeals court judge,” Breyer added. . Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented, saying the appeals court took the correct approach. . Shares of Teva were up 0.4 percent at $57.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. . The case is Teva v. Sandoz, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-854. |Tue Jan 20 15:44:20 +0000 2015||Supreme Court rules for Teva in over multiple sclerosis drug patent |5.5756428975067136e+17|http://reut.rs/1unD8Ns
|DAKAR (Reuters) - The economic impact of Ebola on African economies in 2015 will be less severe than previously thought, the World Bank said in a report on Tuesday, causing just a fraction of the more than $25 billion in losses first expected. . The GDP impact on countries beyond the three directly affected — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — is now estimated at $500 million as governments make progress in fighting the disease. . The first Ebola outbreak in West Africa began 13 months ago when a Guinean toddler became infected with the hemorrhagic fever. . It has spread within the region, killing more than 8,000 people, although countries like Nigeria, Mali and Senegal have succeeded in eradicating it and there are signs other affected countries are making progress. . “I am very encouraged to see Ebola transmission rates slowing markedly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and that other potential outbreaks have been averted because of swift action by other West African governments,” Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group, said in the report.  . Still, the virus will have a major impact on countries directly affected, resulting in at least $1.6 billion in lost economic growth this year or over 12 percent of their combined GDP’s. . If Ebola spreads to more countries, the cost for African economies could be as high as $6 billion, the report said. . Sub-Saharan Africa will grow by 4.6 percent in 2015, down slightly from the 5 percent the bank originally forecast due to Ebola as well as falling oil and commodity prices. |Tue Jan 20 14:05:11 +0000 2015||Economic impact of Ebola less severe than first thought: World Bank |5.5753933700990566e+17|http://reut.rs/1xQK1RV
Julie Steenhuysen|CHICAGO (Reuters) - The simple fact of growing up in a big city may not be a major factor in whether a child develops asthma, according to a new study that contradicts decades of public health assumptions about the so-called inner city asthma epidemic. . Instead, researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore found that being poor, black or Puerto Rican are the most important factors that determine a child’s asthma risk. . “Our results highlight the changing face of pediatric asthma and suggest that living in an urban area is, by itself, not a risk factor for asthma,” said Dr. Corinne Keet, a pediatric allergy and asthma specialist at Johns Hopkins, whose study was published on Tuesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. . Although prior studies have looked at asthma rates within specific cities, no study has compared asthma rates in inner city areas across the United States, or looked at how asthma compares in other types of communities, Keet said. . To arrive at that, the researchers used national survey data on more than 23,000 children aged 6 to 17 between 2009-2011. The team looked at rates of asthma based on population figures as well as factors such as income, race and ethnicity. . After adjusting for those factors, they found no statistically significant difference in the rates of asthma between inner-city children and those who lived elsewhere. . Instead, they found Black or Puerto Rican children had far higher asthma rates, at 17 and 20 percent, respectively, compared with white children (10 percent), other Hispanic children (9 percent) and Asian children (8 percent). . Although the study did not look at why, the researchers did note that other studies suggest potential genetic and biologic causes for these racial and ethnic differences. . The team also saw wide variation by geography, with 17 percent of children living in Northeastern cities having asthma, compared with 8 percent in cities located in western states. . Asthma was not confined to cities. For example, asthma rates were 21 percent in poor suburban areas of the Northeast, compared with 17 percent in neighboring cities. . The study did not look at factors that influence the severity of asthma, which could very well be more prevalent in cities, the authors said. That will be a subject of a follow-on study. . Asthma affects 6.8 million children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. |Tue Jan 20 12:26:07 +0000 2015||Big city life may not be a key asthma risk: U.S. study |5.575144089400115e+17|http://reut.rs/1umRZIb

Kate Kelland|LONDON - The international charity Medecins Sans Frontieres urged drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer on Tuesday to slash the price of their pneumococcal vaccines to $5 per child in poor countries. . In a report on vaccine prices ahead of an international donor conference in Berlin at the end of January, MSF slammed Big Pharma companies and said the cost of vaccinating a child in the world’s poorest countries was now 68 times higher than in 2001. . The “skyrocketing” prices mean many countries can’t afford expensive new vaccines such as those that protect against pneumococcal disease, which kills about a million children a year, MSF’s report said. . “A handful of big pharmaceutical companies are overcharging donors and developing countries for vaccines that already earn them billions of dollars in wealthy countries,” said Rohit Malpani, policy and analysis director for MSF’s access campaign. . Responding to the criticism, GSK said in a statement that it was already barely covering its costs with the price it charges poorer countries for its pneumococcal shot, Synflorix, which it said was “one of the most complex we’ve ever manufactured”. . “Many of our available vaccines are advanced and complex and require significant upfront capital investment to make and supply,” it said, adding that to discount pneumococcal vaccines further would threaten GSK’s ability to supply them long-term. . Pfizer also said its pneumococcal shot, Prevenar 13, was highly complex. “It takes more than two years to create one batch of Prevenar 13, encompassing some 500 separate quality control tests ... multiple facilities and hundreds of trained professionals,” it said in a statement. . MSF’s report said pneumococcal shots alone accounted for about 45 percent of the cost of fully vaccinating a child against 12 diseases. It said GSK and Pfizer had together reported more than $19 billion in global sales for pneumococcal vaccines since their launch.  . A pledging conference for the GAVI global vaccines alliance is due in Berlin next week, when government donors and private philanthropists will be asked for some $7.5 billion to help immunize hundreds of millions of children in poor countries between 2016 and 2020. . “Governments need to put pressure on (drug) companies to offer better prices to GAVI,” said Kate Elder, an MSF policy adviser.  . “We need to put public health before profit. Life-saving vaccines for children shouldn’t be big business in poor countries.” |Tue Jan 20 05:16:09 +0000 2015||MSF slams expensive vaccines, urges GSK and Pfizer to cut prices |5.574062044741632e+17|http://reut.rs/1ulHB3k
|PARIS (Reuters) - Israel has reported the first cases of a highly pathogenic bird flu virus in nearly three years in a village in the northern district of Hazafon, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday. . The deadly H5N1 virus caused the death of 15,000 birds at a turkey fattening farm in Avi’el, south of Haifa, the OIE reported on its website, citing data submitted by Israel’s ministry of agriculture. . More than 140,000 birds will be culled due to the outbreak, of which 61,000 turkeys at a farm nearby where no clinical signs have been seen, the ministry said. . “The culling of all the flocks is ongoing. Backyard birds in the village will also be culled,” it said. . High pathogenic H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths. |Mon Jan 19 15:07:46 +0000 2015||Israel reports bird flu outbreak at turkey farm: OIE |5.571926999218299e+17|http://reut.rs/1xLDxny
Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters) - Families with underimmunized or unvaccinated children tend to cluster together, a new study shows.  . Underimmunization is tied to an increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, the researchers write in the journal Pediatrics.  . “We now have the opportunity to use really sophisticated methods to identify these kinds of clusters of undervaccination or vaccine refusal,” said Dr. Tracy Lieu, the study’s lead author from the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, California. . “With tools like these we have much more power and ability to identify emerging issues than anyone would have 20 or 30 years ago,” she said. . While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that vaccine rates remain high, some vaccine-preventable diseases, like measles, have made comebacks in recent years. . Lieu and colleagues hope that by identifying clusters of people who refuse to vaccinate their children or refuse certain shots, researchers can target prevention efforts. . For the new study, they analyzed records for 154,424 children born between 2000 and 2011 in 13 California counties. All were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large nonprofit health plan. . Using those records, they were able to identify five clusters with higher rates of three-year-olds who had missed at least one vaccine.  . About 18 percent to 23 percent of children in those clusters were underimmunized, compared to about 11 percent of children outside those clusters. . Children whose parents refused vaccines were also clustered in geographic areas. Rates of refusal ranged from about 6 percent to about 14 percent in the clusters, compared to about 3 percent outside of those areas. . In addition to targeting those areas for public health messages, Lieu said doctors can be more alert to the possibility of vaccine-preventable disease. . “If you know there is a cluster of undervaccination or vaccine refusal in a certain area, you may be more vigilant,” she said. . The study can’t say why these areas of underimmunization and vaccine refusal formed, however. . “This really identifies a nice mechanism to identify where there might be a problem with misconceptions or whatever the reason is, but an area where resources can be well spent to provide more focused information and dispel and misinformation people may have,” said Dr. Amar Safdar, an infectious disease expert at NYU Langone Medical Center who was not involved with the new study.  . Safdar said parents sometimes believe vaccines are dangerous. . “The reason why science and medicine is behind vaccination is that there is no identifiable damage to the kids,” he said. . SOURCE: .

Andrew  M. Seaman|By Andrew  M. Seaman . (Reuters) - The age at which babies are introduced to foods with gluten doesn’t affect their risk of developing celiac disease, a new study finds. . Earlier studies had suggested that introducing gluten between the ages of four and six months might lower the risk of celiac disease, a condition in which gluten in food triggers a damaging immune response in the small intestines.  . But in this new study, children introduced to gluten before age 17 weeks or after 26 weeks were not at an increased risk of developing celiac disease, compared to those who were introduced to the protein between those ages, researchers found. . Carin Andrén Aronsson, the study’s lead author from Lund University in Malmö, Sweden, said parents should still follow the general recommendation for introducing children to gluten. . “For Europe anyway you should introduce gluten in small amounts at four to six months of ages,” she said. “I think we can still stick with that.” . In the U.S. and Europe, about one in 100 people have celiac disease. If they consume wheat, barley or rye, or foods that contain those grains, their immune response leads to intestinal damage, malnutrition and other problems. . As reported in the journal Pediatrics, Aronsson’s group used data from a study of type I diabetes in children from Sweden, Finland, Germany and the U.S. They followed 6,436 children with a genetic predisposition for celiac disease. . On average, children in Sweden were introduced to gluten at about age 22 weeks. Kids in Finland were started on gluten a bit later, at 26 weeks. Those in Germany and the U.S. were introduced to gluten even later, at about 30 weeks, on average. . After five years, 773 children had a marker of celiac disease known as tTGA (tissue transglutaminase antibody) in their blood, and 307 actually developed celiac disease – based on an intestinal biopsy or consistently high tTGA levels. . Overall, children with a specific genetic predisposition, those born in Sweden, females and kids with a family history of celiac disease were more likely to develop the condition. . After adjusting for those factors, there was no link between when the children were introduced to gluten and their risk of developing celiac disease. . The researchers did find that children in Sweden are more likely to develop celiac disease, compared to children in the U.S. Based on the results, the researchers suggest it may be due to an interaction of gluten and weaning, but that result needs more research. . Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women exclusively breastfeed their newborns for six months after birth. Then, they should continue breastfeeding for one year or more as they introduce other foods. . Around the world, the incidence of celiac disease is increasing, but researchers still don’t know why, said Dr. Peter Green, director of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University. . “We have to address the reason,” said Green, who was not involved with the new study. . He also said the new study, with the support of previous research, does not suggest that people need to follow any specific recommendation about gluten introduction. . Two other recent studies also found that timing of gluten introduction to a baby's diet doesn’t protect them from celiac disease (see Reuters Health story of October 1, 2014 here: . ) . Green said the new results can probably apply to the general population, but cautioned “they’re not studying the general population.” Instead, this research involved high-risk children. . SOURCE: .

Dorene Internicola|NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gym goers seeking to boost their workouts might do well to aim for the less-used equipment beyond the busy rows of treadmills and elliptical trainers that dominate the center of the cardio floor, fitness experts say. . What the rower and the moving stairs may lack in traffic, they can make up for in effectiveness and intensity for people willing to think outside the box. . “What’s the best piece of cardio equipment? My short answer is the one no one’s using,” said exercise physiologist Tom Holland, author of “Beat the Gym.” . People tend to do what they’re good at and what they see others doing, he said. . Holland’s favorite under-appreciated machine is the moving stairs. . “It’s tougher than the traditional StairMaster, harder to cheat on, and usually hidden away in dark recesses of the gym,” he said. . The treadmill is the most used machine, according to the trade association IHRSA (International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association), followed by resistance machines and elliptical trainers.  . Stair climbers and recumbent cycles are among the most ignored, it says. . Hayley Zawadzki, personal training manager at the New York Health and Racquet Club (NYHRC) fitness center chain in Manhattan, favors the rowing machine. . “It burns a high amount of calories in a short amount of time, activates large muscle groups and is also good for training cardio endurance for marathoners and triathletes,” she said. . Zawadzki believes the rower is not very popular because it takes some guidance to use properly.  . “As a warm-up, it’s a great way to loosen up the body, break a quick sweat,” she said. “Our trainers use it in circuit training as a cardio burst between strength training intervals.” . Nasario Meija, vice president at Crunch Fitness, said just as the rower is not only for athletes, the recumbent bike, which puts riders in a laid-back position, is recommended mostly for beginners.  . “It does not require as much dynamic movement as a rower or a treadmill,” Meija said. “It’s a good starting point into a progressive cardio routine, or for people with lower back or knee problems because it’s very soft on the joints.”  . Holland said it’s a mistake to always do the same machines in the same order.  . “We need mix it up,” he said. “Start every workout with an exercise you don’t like, or use one piece of equipment you’re not used to, and the body will respond.”  |Mon Jan 19 13:19:36 +0000 2015||Tethered to treadmills?

P.J. Huffstutter|CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc is funding the testing of lower dosages of its controversial cattle growth drug Zilmax, in a move that livestock experts say is crucial if the company is to resume sales of the product to the U.S. beef industry. . Nearly 18 months after Merck pulled the drug from the U.S. and Canadian markets after videos and photographs surfaced showing Zilmax-fed cattle turning up in a distressed state, either lame or with hooves missing at slaughterhouses, scientists at Texas Tech University are testing beef carcasses taken from cattle fed different concentrations of Zilmax. . The Merck-funded field study and lab work, which have not previously been reported, are designed to test Zilmax at its currently approved dosage of 6.8 grams per ton of feed for a 20-day period prior to slaughter, as well as dosages at about 60 percent and nearly 80 percent of that level, according to the title of the study. At the time Merck pulled Zilmax off the market, it had only one dosage level approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. . Merck awarded $1.85 million to the Texas Tech team in October to conduct the research, the university mentioned at the time in a newsletter that got little attention outside of the school. The research is ongoing and the specific time frame of the study was not clear.  . “This study is an example of the company’s ongoing research efforts to provide additional data on the use of Zilmax,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. . Merck, which says it still sells Zilmax in Mexico and South Africa, declined to comment on why it was testing these particular levels or whether it was collecting data to submit to the FDA. Merck also declined to say how many cattle are being fed Zilmax as part of the tests, or where the animals are being raised or slaughtered. It declined to give any further details. . An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the study, citing confidentiality regarding drug applications.  . Texas Tech did not respond to requests for comment.  . In November, federal regulators approved changes proposed by the company in the way the drug is administered. The company has also been working with cattle feed lot operators on how best to administer the drug. . “It looks to me like they’re doing studies to determine if the lower dosages are efficacious in improving feed efficiency, growth rate and carcass leanness,” said David Anderson, former head of swine research at Elanco Animal Health, a unit of Merck rival Eli Lily & Co, when Reuters told him about the study. . A similar product called Optaflexx, made by Elanco “has captured the market,” said Arizona cattle rancher Harvey Dietrich, co-founder of advocacy group Beef Additive Alert, which is critical of growth-promotants such as Zilmax. “Merck wants their market share back,” he added. . At the time the videos of the distressed cattle surfaced in 2013, some veterinarians argued that a key problem was that the drug, at its approved dosage, was too potent for some animals.   . The drug company does not need federal approval to return Zilmax to the market. But all four of the nation’s largest beef packers and many meat producers have told Reuters they won’t accept Zilmax until Merck can scientifically prove the drug doesn’t cause the animal welfare issues seen in the past. . One option, say industry experts, would be for Merck to show the FDA that Zilmax is effective and safe at helping cattle gain weight at lower dosages, and petition the agency to alter the product’s usage label. . The multi-site study that Merck is funding could provide the data needed to make such a petition, according to industry experts. Current labeling covers both dosage and details about its effectiveness on cattle.     . Major meat packers like Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Tyson Foods Inc say they are not processing any meat from Merck’s study or slaughtering cattle fed with Zilmax. Spokesmen for Cargill, Tyson, National Beef Packing Co [NBEEF.UL] and JBS USA [JBS.UL] said their companies were not participating in the study. |Mon Jan 19 13:19:35 +0000 2015||Exclusive: Merck funds tests of lower Zilmax doses as seen seeking way to resume sales |5.571654755795927e+17|http://reut.rs/1xLawbz
|CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian woman and child died of H5N1 bird flu, the health ministry said on Monday, the fourth and fifth persons to die of the illness in the country this year. . The six-year-old child died in Minya province on Monday evening, after a 47-year-old woman succumbed to the disease in Assiut province earlier in the day, ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar said. . Both Assiut and Minya provinces are rural areas that have seen a number of bird flu cases in the past year. . The ministry announced one other case in treatment, bringing the total number of cases in Egypt to 20 this year so far. This includes five deaths as well as six recoveries and nine cases still under treatment, Abdel Ghaffar said. . The World Health Organization says there has been a jump in the number of H5N1 infections in people in Egypt, but that there does not appear to have been any major genetic change in the flu strain to explain the rise in human cases. . At least 10 people died from the disease in Egypt in 2014. . The WHO said last week that between Dec. 4 and Jan. 6 there were 18 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt, including four deaths, the highest ever monthly number of human cases in the country. . The WHO says that whenever bird flu viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk of sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases. . Egypt’s H5N1 cases have largely been in poor rural areas in the south, where villagers tend to raise and slaughter poultry themselves. |Mon Jan 19 11:47:14 +0000 2015||Woman dies of H5N1 bird flu in Egypt, fourth death this year |5.5714223393867366e+17|http://reut.rs/1uinnY7

|HONG KONG (Reuters) - A woman is critically ill in Hong Kong with the deadly H7N9 strain of bird flu, the first confirmed case in the city this winter, the Hong Kong government said. . The woman, 68, was admitted to hospital on Thursday after falling ill on Dec. 19, the Hong Kong government said in a statement issued on Saturday. . The case has been classified as “imported” after it emerged the woman had recently been in the Longgang district of Shenzhen in mainland China, where the first human case of the deadly H7N9 strain was reported in March 2013 . The woman ate chicken while in Shenzhen but was not exposed to live poultry, the government said.  . The government is trying to track down friends of the woman who may have been exposed to the virus, the source of which had not been determined.  . The first known human case of the H7N9 strain was reported in mainland China in March last year, according to the World Health Organization. The virus subsequently spread to Hong Kong last December where it killed three people.  . Officials at Hong Kong’s Health and Food and Environmental Health Departments were not available for comment. . Hong Kong hospitals have introduced measures to monitor and contain influenza infection, including cutting visitor hours, after the government raised the city’s influenza pandemic response level to “serious”, it said in a statement late on Saturday.   |Sun Dec 28 04:34:18 +0000 2014||Hong Kong confirms first case of deadly bird flu this winter |5.490607482916045e+17|http://reut.rs/1AWrIQY
Shereen Lehman|(Reuters) - In poor, mostly Latino areas of Denver, Colorado, people who suffer cardiac arrest are less likely to get help in part because distrust of law enforcement and language barriers stop bystanders from calling 911 or learning CPR, researchers say. . “We always sort of take it for granted the people will call 911, and this is the first study to really take a step back and say, gosh there’s real barriers that we need to talk about,” said Dr. Comilla Sasson, who led the new study. . People who live in poor and minority neighborhoods are more likely to suffer cardiac arrest outside of a hospital, and less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or to survive, Sasson and her colleagues write in Annals of Emergency Medicine. . The results of the survey point out several misconceptions that need to be addressed in such communities, like the fear that first responders “aren’t going to help you unless you’re documented or that they’re going to arrest you,” Sasson, an emergency physician at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, told Reuters Health.  . “It’s something we spent a lot of time here in Denver really talking to our police officers and talking to our community members to let them know that if you call 911 we’re not going to ask for identification - we’re here to help you,” Sasson said. . For their study, Sasson and colleagues recruited residents of five low-income, primarily Latino neighborhoods in Denver to form focus groups and do individual interviews to find out what might prevent them from calling 911, learning CPR or performing it.  . A total of 55 people participated in six focus groups, along with an additional nine individual interviews. . The researchers identified six major barriers to calling 911, including the fear of law enforcement if the bystander was undocumented or had a criminal history.  . Participants also misunderstood or were not aware of Good Samaritan laws and worried that law enforcement or the victim’s family would blame them if the person did not survive.  . Cultural and language issues were also important. For instance, there was considerable concern about the propriety or safety of touching another person, especially a stranger, in the chest area or on the mouth.  . “I don’t know if it’s limited to Hispanic culture or not, but the hesitancy to touch another person, especially in the chest, and if it’s a woman, oh my goodness . . . Uh, there is great hesitation on the older people’s part,” said one participant. . Many also expressed the fear of not being able to communicate with an emergency dispatcher. . “One of the things we found that’s specific to the Latinos in Denver, and I think it’s something that’s important for people to know, is when you do call 911 how to say the right words to get through faster,” Sasson said. . It can take 5 to 10 minutes for the dispatcher to communicate with somebody who doesn’t speak English while trying to figure out the medical emergency, Sasson said, so she trains people in the community to say “heart stopped, Spanish interpreter” when they call 911. . “It’s not rocket science by any means, but ‘heart stopped’ triggers that this is a medical emergency,” Sasson said, and saying “Spanish interpreter” immediately lets the operator know they don’t speak English. . The main reasons people gave for not learning CPR included the cost, lack of classes and not being aware of how CPR can save lives.  . “We know from the research we’ve done that Latinos are 30 percent less likely to have CPR performed and what the study really showed it was not that Latinos don’t want to do CPR or that they’re afraid of it,” Sasson said. . “It’s truly, I  think, that we haven’t gotten the messaging out on how important it is and how easy it is to do, especially now that you can do it without breathing into somebody’s mouth - you can do hands-only CPR.” . Sasson said the American Heart Association has a Spanish-language website at heart.org/rcp with training materials and a 60-second video that people can watch to learn how to do hands-only CPR in Spanish. . “Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem and bystander CPR significantly improves your odds of survival on the order of tripling (them) and there’s large disparities in who receives bystander CPR,” Dr. Ben Bobrow, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health. . “There’s both economic and racial disparities in who has access to life-saving therapy like CPR and it’s unacceptable that people shouldn’t have access to simple life-saving interventions like CPR,” said Bobrow, who is medical director of the EMS and Trauma System in the Arizona Department of Health Services and the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson.  .

Madeline Kennedy|(Reuters) - Teenagers are more likely than middle aged drivers to die in crashes while driving older, smaller cars, according to a recent study. . Based on a census of fatal car accidents over five years, researchers found that four out of five teens killed were driving cars that were at least six years old and nearly half drove cars that were more than 11 years old. In addition, nearly one third of the teens killed were driving small or mini cars. . “Many teenagers are driving – and dying in – the least protective types of vehicles,” said Anne McCartt, a senior vice president of research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) who led the study. . Car accidents are the leading cause of death among U.S. teenagers, and teens are three times more likely than adults to have a motor vehicle accident, McCartt told Reuters in an email.  . Teens are less mature and often more confident than adult drivers, leading them to speed and neglect to wear seatbelts, said Keli Braitman, an assistant professor of psychology at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, who studies teenage drivers. . “Because of their lack of experience, they’re also less able to recognize and handle emergencies and hazards when they arise,” she told Reuters Health in an email. Braitman was not involved in the new study. . McCartt and another researcher used data on fatal accidents from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System covering 2008 through 2012. They examined the types and sizes of cars driven by 15- to 17-year-olds who were driving when killed in a crash, then compared results to drivers between 35 and 50 years old who died behind the wheel.  . In the sample of around 2,500 teens, 82 percent were killed in crashes while driving cars over six years old and 48 percent drove cars over 11 years old.  . Among the 19,000 middle-aged drivers killed, 77 percent were in cars more than six years old and 46 percent had cars over 11 years old. . The car sizes involved in the fatalities differed considerably between age groups. Among the teens, 29 percent were driving a mini or small car and 23 percent were driving a mid-size car when they crashed. In comparison, 20 percent of middle-aged drivers had a mini or small car and 16 percent a mid-size, when killed. . Older drivers were more likely to be in large pick-up trucks (17 percent, versus 10 percent of teens) and midsize SUVs ( 11 percent, versus 9 percent of teens), according to the results published in Injury Prevention. . “Newer vehicles tend to fare better in crashes than older vehicles, and are more likely to have safety features,” Braitman said. She listed electronic stability control (ESC), a program that automatically applies breaks when the car skids, as a key feature.  . Another important safety feature is side air bags, which Braitman said can protect both the driver and passengers in a crash. . “Smaller, lighter vehicles don’t afford as much crash protection as bigger, heavier vehicles,” McCartt said. . One limitation of the study, Braitman noted, is that the researchers did not compare data on people killed in crashes to those who didn’t die. This makes it difficult to say, for example, whether teens are more often killed in older cars because these cars are more dangerous or because teens are more likely to drive older cars. . According to McCartt, parents are concerned with safety, but often do not have up-to-date information on safety features. The IIHS, which funded the study, offers an online guide for parents to help them choose the safest possible used cars at a reasonable price (. ).  . The guide, titled “Safety rides shotgun: the best used vehicles for teen drivers,” advises against high horsepower, and recommends bigger, heavier cars as well as cars with ESC and good crash test ratings. . “A teenager’s first vehicle is more than just a financial decision. Parents need to do their homework and factor in safety as well as affordability,” McCartt said. . SOURCE: .

Janice Neumann|(Reuters) - Those sun salutations and downward dogs could be as good for the heart as cycling or brisk walking, and easier to tolerate for older people and those with health challenges, according to a new review of existing research. . Based on 37 clinical trials, researchers found that doing yoga lowered blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate and other cardiovascular risk factors in increments comparable to those seen with aerobic exercise. . “Taken together, these improvements could facilitate and complement a regimen toward better cardiovascular health,” said Paula Chu, a doctoral candidate in health policy at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the study. . She and her co-authors caution in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, however, that larger studies are needed to understand how yoga improves health, how much of it is ideal and if there are differences in benefits from various types of yoga before the practice becomes a standard prescription for heart disease. . Nonetheless, yoga’s benefits have been long suspected, said Dr. Larry Phillips, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. . “I think what we’ve seen is with yoga and the relaxation and behavior modification that goes along with it, there is a benefit to all patients, but especially those with heart disease,” said Phillips, who was not involved in the new analysis. . “Here we are able to see there are more measurable benefits than we’ve seen before,” he told Reuters Health. . Yoga originated in India more than 5,000 years ago, and has become a popular mind-body therapy in the West. Yoga’s breath control and body postures are believed to help nourish self-awareness, control stress and develop physical strength and balance.    . The more traditional Hatha style of yoga is the most widely practiced in the U.S. But many specialized yoga “products,” such as hot yoga, power yoga and yoga retreats are part of a billion-dollar yoga industry.  . One study estimates that 15 million Americans have practiced yoga at least once, according to Chu and her co-authors. . They focused on yoga’s effects on cardiovascular disease, as well as risk factors including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat and abnormal cholesterol levels that make up a profile - known as metabolic syndrome – that often leads to heart disease and diabetes. . The study team analyzed 37 randomized, controlled trials involving 2,768 people through December 2013. The trials either looked at yoga compared to no exercise or to aerobic exercises. Participants’ average age was 50 and they were followed for anywhere from 12 weeks to one year. . Those who did yoga had significant improvements in a range of risk factors. Systolic blood pressure (the top number) dropped by an average of 5.21 mm Hg, and diastolic pressure (the bottom number) dropped 4.9 mm HG. LDL “bad” cholesterol fell by an average 12.14 mg/dl and HDL “good” cholesterol rose by an average 3.20 mg/dl. Average heart rate was lower by a little over 5 beats per minute and weight loss averaged a bit over 5 pounds. . These changes were similar to the improvements seen among people who did aerobic exercise instead. . There were no changes, though, in fasting glucose levels or A1C, a measure of long-term blood sugar control in diabetics. . Chu and her colleagues note that one weakness of the results is that the analyzed trials included various types of yoga that were practiced for different amounts of time. These included Silver yoga (for seniors), Iyengar yoga (a form of Hatha that emphasizes correct postures), Viniyoga (which includes chanting) and Vinyasa (breath-synchronized movements.) . There were also a wide range of populations, from the young and healthy to older people with histories of heart disease, Chu told Reuters Health. . “We are not recommending anyone ditch their medicines or established medical or physical practices,” she said. “Individuals can talk to their doctors about whether yoga is a viable option for them.” . Yoga classes may be offered at health clubs, spas, senior centers and in other settings. Individual classes at stand-alone yoga centers tend to range from $15 to $30.  . Phillips said he encourages his patients to develop a healthy lifestyle and exercise regimen, which could include yoga. He urges people to find a class that is appropriate for their comfort level and ability. . “I think the effects of relaxation do decrease stress levels and have a benefit to the heart,” said Phillips, adding that he had found doing yoga boosted his own mood and energy level.	 .

|LONDON (Reuters) - Ireland’s High Court ruled on Friday that a life support machine keeping a brain-dead woman alive could be switched off because her unborn fetus had no chance of survival, a decision likely to upset anti-abortion campaigners. . While the unusual case is unlikely to set a precedent, it has revived debate in the predominantly Catholic country about its abortion ban.   . The pregnant woman, who has not been named to protect her privacy, was declared clinically dead on Dec. 3 after damaging her head in a serious fall. Doctors then refused her family’s pleas to turn off her life support machine, citing fears they could be sued for negligence or even be charged with murder for depriving her unborn fetus of life support. . The High Court ruled on Friday that the case raised issues of “great public importance” but said the 18-week fetus would not survive because of the deteriorating state of the woman’s body, meaning that continuing life support was futile. . “While the unborn child is not yet in distress, it is facing into a ‘perfect storm’ from which it has no realistic prospect of emerging alive. It has nothing but distress and death in prospect,” the court said in its ruling. . It held out the prospect however that it might rule differently in future cases if a fetus had a realistic chance of survival, stressing that the rights of an unborn child “must prevail over the feelings of grief and respect for a mother who is no longer living.” |Fri Dec 26 18:03:19 +0000 2014||Life support can be ended for clinically-dead pregnant woman: Irish court |5.485395692229837e+17|http://reut.rs/1ASuwyx
Kathryn Doyle|(Reuters) - Women’s self-exams and physical exams by a doctor both detect breast cancer tumors at about the same size, but older women are more likely to have a tumor discovered via doctor’s examination, according to a new Swiss study. . The authors, led by Fabienne Dominique Schwab of University Hospital Basel, conclude that breast exams by doctors should be an integral part of general medical care for older women. . “What they essentially said was there wasn’t a whole lot of difference in these two modes of detection except that older women were more likely to have their cancers detected by clinical exam,” said Dr. Robert Smith, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia who was not involved in the new study. . The authors considered tumor size, location and detection method for 948 women treated in Switzerland between 1990 and 2009.  . In 236 women, doctors found the tumors during an exam, while 712 women had discovered their own tumors. . Women who found their own tumors had an average age of 60, compared to an average age of nearly 66 for women whose tumors were found through clinical breast exam. Both methods found the same number of tumors in the same locations and of similar size, averaging 22 millimeters (about 9/10ths of an inch), the authors write. . Tumors in the central region of the breast tended to be larger – an average of 25 mm versus about 19-21 mm for those at the periphery - the authors reported in the journal The Breast. . Doctors and women who perform regular self-examinations should pay particular attention to the central region, the authors advise. . Older women may be more likely to overlook or neglect breast lumps, and less likely to go for mammograms, so doctors tend to discover more tumors of their tumors, the study team writes.  . The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends a clinical breast examination, which includes palpation by a health professional, about once every three years between ages 20 and 40, and yearly for older women.  . Some women do self-exams once a month, but choosing not to do them regularly or at all is okay, according to the ACS. . “It is encouraging and perhaps to be celebrated that women are detecting similar rates of cancers and this should arm women with confidence that they are performing this task well,” said Victoria Harmer, Team Leader and Clinical Nurse Specialist in the breast care unit at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London. . “The risk of breast cancer increases with a woman’s age, so it is vital older women continue to be breast aware,” said Harmer, who was not involved in the new study. . Anthony B. Miller of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto has studied breast cancer detection in a large group of women in an ongoing study begun in 1980. . “Although in the (Canadian National Breast Screening Study) we learnt that women who practice (self-exam) well had a reduced rate of death from breast cancer, what we tend to promote now is what people call breast self-awareness,” Miller told Reuters Health by email. “By this we mean that women should be aware of the structure of their own breasts and should be alert to any change, which if it occurs, should lead them to seek professional advice.” . Especially for young women, self-exam tends to create many false alarms, he said. . Some women can have “lumpy” breasts, Miller said, adding that “very few lumps turn out to be breast cancer.” . The ACS recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. But the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel that weighs current medical evidence, recommends mammograms every two years starting at age 50 for women without special risk factors (see Reuters Health article of April 1, 2014 here: . ). . It is questionable whether clinical breast exams add anything on top of the mammograms, Smith said. . Clinical breast exam quality in the U.S. is low, he noted. “In the U.S. it is quite cursory, it doesn’t take very long,” Smith said. “The physician usually has not had much training in clinical breast examination.” . In the big picture, mammograms are going to account for more breast cancer discoveries than clinical exam, and the new results do not change existing ACS recommendations, he said. . SOURCE: .

Shereen Lehman|(Reuters) - Punishing children for bedwetting won’t solve the problem and may make it worse, researchers say. . In a new study, children who were punished for wetting the bed at night were more likely to be depressed and had worse overall quality of life overall compared to bed-wetters who were not punished. . Nighttime bedwetting, or “nocturnal enuresis,” affects about 15 percent of young children and is three times more common in boys than girls, according to the authors. Up to a third of parents punish their kids for bedwetting, they add. . While parents might think punishment will make bedwetting stop, they should know that punishment can actually make the problem worse, leading to more frequent bedwetting, more depression and a poorer quality of life for the child, the researchers wrote in the journal Child Abuse and Neglect. . Dr. Faten Nabeel Al-Zaben of the Faculty of Medicine at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and a colleague studied 65 children ages seven to 13 years old who wet their beds, and 40 healthy children without a bedwetting problem as a comparison group.  . Next, the researchers divided the children with bedwetting problems into two groups, those who were punished for bedwetting and those who weren’t.  . On average, children who were punished for bedwetting at night wet their beds more often than the children who weren’t punished.  . The punished kids also showed symptoms of depression that were more severe than the other two groups of kids.  . The effect was worst when parents physically punished their kids, and the more often they punished their children, the more likely the children were to be depressed and have reduced quality of life scores. . “Urinary incontinence affects both the child and the family on several levels. It is often a source of shame and embarrassment for the affected child, and children who have experienced treatment failure have a lower self-esteem,” the authors write. . Dr. Max Maizels, a pediatric urologist at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago who was not involved in the study, said that most healthcare workers would agree that punishment causes problems for kids. . “Most instances of bedwetting, whether they run in the family or not, have to do with heavy sleep and a sluggish coordination between bladder signals that say ‘take me to the bathroom’ and a deep level of sleep that prevents the signals from reaching awareness,” Maizels told Reuters Health in an email.  . He said that if that coordination is sluggish then the bladder empties without the child’s permission, so anything that can be done to accentuate the child’s awareness will help reduce bedwetting. . “One common thing that can be done is called positive practice, where children lay in bed before they go to sleep and practice getting up and going to the bathroom,” Maizels said. . He added that reading children’s books about bedwetting before bed also helps raise awareness. . A change of scenery or temperature may help too.  . Maizels said that when families go on a vacation or to Grandma’s house, they’re startled when the bedwetting that happens with some regularity at home is reduced while they’re away. . “Cold seems to set up bedwetting. Some families have a child’s bed adjacent to an exposed wall and by moving the bed away from the cold wall it seems to reduce wetting,” Maizels said. . Maizels also said that some dietary changes may help. . “Keep things that may irritate the bladder away from the diet while the bedwetting is resolving like carbonated beverages, citrus, melons, caffeinated foods,” he said. . Maizels also explained that constipation can be a big factor in bedwetting when the over-full bowel puts pressure on the bladder. . “Try laxatives, milk of magnesia or any of the common laxatives, prune juice, or apple juice works to help with evacuating,” Maizels said. .

Janice Neumann|(Reuters) - Regardless of IQ, people who work at complex jobs have a slightly higher chance of being better thinkers as they age, a recent study suggests. . “When we look at the association between complexity of work with people or data, we see that those in more complex jobs generally do better on a range of cognitive ability measures,” said Alan Gow, one of the study authors. . “That’s not necessarily surprising . . . but we were able to add an interesting twist,” said Gow, an assistant professor of psychology at the School of Life Sciences at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland. . The researchers knew from earlier work that complex jobs might help protect cognitive ability later in life. So they added the childhood IQs of 1,066 people in Scotland from a 1936 study to their analysis.  . They also grouped the people from that study according to profession - for example, architect, engineer and lawyer (higher thinking jobs) or typist and salesperson (requiring less complicated thinking).  . The study participants, all age 70 during the new analysis, took cognitive tests that determined general thinking ability, speed and memory. Their educational and criminal backgrounds and access to services were also factored in. . By including data on IQ from the participants when they were 11 years old, “the association between more complex jobs and better cognitive outcomes is reduced, but there remains a small additional benefit for our cognitive abilities from being in more complex jobs,” Gow told Reuters Health in an email. . Childhood IQ explained about half of the difference in later thinking ability in the participants. And complex jobs were responsible for about 1 to 2 percent of the cognitive differences between people later in life, according to the results in the journal Neurology. . The researchers said the cognitive benefit of a complex job was similar to the benefits of not smoking on later cognition. . “It’s been proposed, for example, that more complex work with people and data might require the deployment of various cognitive abilities; this may develop these skills, or at least protect them from decline, and people are exploring what those suggested mechanisms might actually look like in terms of changes in the brain,” Gow said. . He’s been looking at a variety of lifestyle factors that might predict cognitive ability in older people, including leisure and physical activity and social networks and support. . “The reason I focus on factors like these is that many, though not all, of course, are amenable to change. If we can identify the things that protect or harm our cognitive abilities, we will be able to provide clear information or design better interventions,” Gow said. . “I think the opportunity to use our thinking and reasoning skills and continually use them throughout our lives likely contributes to our ability to stay sharp,” said Sian Beilock, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago.  . “So being able to do complex thinking and reasoning in our profession is one way to continually flex our cognitive horsepower or brain power,” said Beilock, who was not involved in the study.  . Other ways to ward off cognitive decline include exercise, and remembering our strengths, rather than dwelling on what we’re forgetting, he said.  . “Doing things to get rid of those worries, whether reminding yourself you have lots of experience or jotting down things (like worries) in notes . . . can help ensure you can use all the brain power at your disposal,” Beilock said.  .

Emma Farge|FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leoneans observed a somber Christmas in their homes on Thursday, after the government banned traditionally boisterous holiday celebrations to prevent the spread of deadly Ebola in the worst-hit country. . Small groups of Christians in formal attire were permitted to attend church services, but the family gatherings, beach parties, concerts and dancing that usually accompany the holiday were banned to help slow the deadly virus. . Police patrolled the capital’s twisting streets and manned temperature check points to watch for symptoms of the haemorrhagic fever. On the radio, musicians who would normally be performing at live concerts played Ebola awareness jingles. . “We want to avoid contact because of this deadly disease. It’s necessary but I am not really happy. Normally we have a lot of fun with family and friends, but we just have to stay home,” said Kadija Kargbo, a cleaner in the capital Freetown. . She planned to stay indoors and watch films with her children instead of celebrating at the beach this year. . At a Red Cross treatment center in the eastern city of  Kenema, a small group of patients gathered around a cassette player listening to Christmas carols, said Jestina Boyle, a psychosocial assistant with the Red Cross. . “Some are sitting and listening and those who are too weak can hear it from their beds,” said Boyle by telephone before doing her morning round to visit the sick.    “I will sing gospel for them. I will give them encouraging words and tell them not to lose hope.” . The center held a small concert for patients earlier this week. A nurse in full personal protective equipment entered the patient area and danced, holding the hands of two children. One patient stood and danced while others watched from their beds. . With more than 9,000 cases, Sierra Leone now accounts for nearly half of the known cases of Ebola in this year’s West African outbreak, the worst ever. Neighboring Liberia and Guinea have also been badly hit. . President Ernest Bai Koroma has announced a new operation to identify the sick in an effort to slow the disease’s spread. Further north in the district of Port Loko, officials have declared a three-day lockdown and asked residents to stay indoors.  . Sierra Leoneans have a reputation for partying in the face of hardship and bars were often heaving during successive rebel incursions into the capital during more than a decade of civil war that ended in 2002. . “People know about Ebola but we are worried that we’ve had it so long that they normalize the situation and party,” said OB Sisay, director of the situation room at the National Ebola Response Centre, explaining the measures. . He said police had received instructions to break up gatherings and arrest the organizers. |Thu Dec 25 11:28:45 +0000 2014||Somber Christmas, gatherings banned in Ebola-hit Sierra Leone |5.480778878329979e+17|http://reut.rs/1AMiF50
Steve Gorman|(Reuters) - A laboratory technician for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been placed under observation for possible exposure to the deadly Ebola virus due to an apparent mix-up in lab specimens, the Atlanta-based agency said on Wednesday. . The technician, who was working on Monday with Ebola specimens that were supposed to have been inactivated but which may instead have contained live virus, will be monitored for signs of infection for 21 days, the disease’s incubation period, CDC officials said. . The error follows two high-profile cases of mishandled samples of anthrax and avian influenza at the CDC earlier this year that called into question safety practices at the highly respected research institute and drew criticism from Capitol Hill. . CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told Reuters the technician’s risk of exposure to Ebola, even if the virus were active, was believed to be low and that the worker was not being quarantined while under observation. . She said a small number of other CDC employees who entered the lab where the samples in question were handled also “were assessed and none require monitoring.” . “There was no possible exposure outside the secure laboratory at CDC and no exposure or risk to the public,” the agency said in a statement. Lab scientists discovered on Tuesday what had transpired, and reported it to superiors within an hour, it said. . The problem occurred when active Ebola virus samples were believed to have been mixed up with specimens that had been rendered inactive for further testing in a lower-security lab down the hall, Reynolds said. . When inactivated specimens turned up the next day in storage, lab personnel realized that they apparently had transferred the wrong samples, ones that had contained active virus material, out of the higher-security lab, Reynolds said. . CDC officials could not be certain because the material in question had by then been destroyed and the lower-security lab decontaminated under routine safety procedures, she said. . The technician who handled the samples had worn protective gloves and a gown but not a face mask, she said. Ebola virus is not airborne. In a lab environment, it could be transmitted from a contaminated surface through physical contact that spreads the virus to the eyes, nose or mouth of an individual. . The mishap resembled the anthrax incident, in which researchers mistakenly believed they had transferred an inactivated sample of bacteria to a lower-security lab where workers wear less-protective gear. No illnesses resulted from that breach. . Then as now, the CDC temporarily halted the transfer of samples at its high-security labs while it reviewed its protocols.  . In July an agency scientist, Dr. Michael Bell, was appointed to a new role overseeing lab safety and a panel of independent experts was formed to advise the institute on such issues. . Bell has since returned to his previous post, Reynolds told Reuters, though she did not say whether anyone else had assumed the lead role for lab safety. . “I am troubled by this incident in our Ebola research laboratory in Atlanta,” the CDC director, Dr. Tom Frieden, said of the latest error. “Thousands of laboratory scientists in more than 150 labs throughout CDC have taken extraordinary steps in recent months to improve safety.” . The CDC also was criticized by some for not doing more to prepare the U.S. medical establishment to deal with Ebola when a Liberian man visiting Dallas in October was diagnosed with the disease after initially being turned away from a hospital emergency room there. . Two nurses who treated that patient before he died ended up contracting the virus but survived. They are the only two people known to have been infected on U.S. soil during the current Ebola epidemic, which has killed more than 7,500 people, most of them in West Africa. |Thu Dec 25 02:32:57 +0000 2014||CDC worker monitored for possible Ebola exposure in lab error |5.4794304814843904e+17|http://reut.rs/1xecg0e
