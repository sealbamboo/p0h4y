|A federal law that passed in 2008 was supposed to ensure that when patients had insurance benefits for mental health and addiction treatment, the coverage was on par with what they received for medical and surgical care. But until now, the government had only spelled out how the law applied to commercial plans.. That changed Monday, when federal officials .  proposing how the parity law should also protect low-income Americans insured through the government’s Medicaid managed care and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans. The proposed regulation is similar to one released in November 2013 for private insurers.. “Whether private insurance, Medicaid, or CHIP, all Americans deserve access to quality mental health services and substance use disorder services,” said Vikki Wachino, acting director at the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services.. Medicaid and CHIP programs are funded jointly by the federal and state governments.. Even if the state has carved out some benefits under a separate behavioral health plan, patients would be protected under the rule. Medicare patients are generally not affected by the regulation, nor are those in Medicaid fee-for-service plans . But the rule does affect the majority of the 70 million people on Medicaid who are in managed care plans, and the 8 million children covered by CHIP plans.. Insurers, advocates and the general public will have a chance to comment on the proposed rule. The government will then release a final version.. The proposal would mean that plans no longer could have hard limits on coverage such as a certain number of mental health visits in a year. And if a patient were to be denied treatment for a mental health or substance use disorder, the insurer would have to explain why.. The regulation has been . , says former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy, lead author of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Act, which passed two years before the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare).. “Even if this rule goes forward, it’s going to be at least another 18 months to implement it. We’re going to be a decade … between when the law was passed and when it’s going to be effective,” said Kennedy. “It’s very emblematic of what we’ve always faced in mental health. We’re always secondary and an afterthought in health care.”. Kennedy and other advocates across the country say commercial insurance plans have been . , even though they have had a final rule for more than a year. Patients .  in their mental health and substance abuse care, Kennedy said, and the federal government has not aggressively enforced the law.. “We have a lot of lessons learned already on the failure of parity to be enforced in commercial plans. We definitely will be carrying over those same problems [into Medicaid plans] if we don’t correct them in time,” he said.. The responsibility for enforcing the new regulation will fall first to state Medicaid agencies. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, said the rule is a welcome development.. “Medicaid has quietly become the largest payer of mental health services in the country,” Salo said. “Medicaid directors are hopeful that parity ultimately helps to level the playing field, which would allow more people to get the care they need at the right time, and ultimately reduce future reliance on Medicaid.”. In the short term, the rule is expected to cost state Medicaid programs $150 million in additional behavioral health costs. “Because of decades of insufficient investments from other payers, approximately 30 percent of all Medicaid dollars are spent on individuals with behavioral health needs. These regulations will lead to increased coverage of — and therefore spending on — behavioral health services for Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care or other capitated care models,” Salo explained.. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare, a large Medicaid health plan based in Long Beach, Calif., said he applauds the government’s plan to have the parity law apply to Medicaid plans. “It’s a great idea,” he said.. Even with parity provisions, however, Molina said he worries about the shortage of mental health providers in Medicaid. “It won’t impact the number of providers, but it will increase demand for them,” he said.. , the director of health law and policy at substance abuse and addiction center CASAColumbia, worries that access to care will make parity difficult to achieve in practice.. The parity rule “will not be enough to overcome all of the barriers that patients face in accessing care, including an insufficient number of in-network providers,” she said. Under the proposed rule, however, plans that allow access to out-of-network providers for physical health issues must provide access for mental health as well, she said.. .|Tue Apr 07 14:50:12 +0000 2015||Rule Proposed On Providing Mental Health Parity In Medicaid Program  |5.854545327646392e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/rule-proposed-on-providing-mental-health-parity-in-medicaid-program/
|By . , many U.S. insurance providers that offer mental health care are required to cover it just as they would cancer or diabetes treatment. But advocates say achieving this .  can be a challenge. A .  released last week by the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that “health insurance plans are .  in coverage of mental health and substance abuse conditions.”. Jenny Gold of Kaiser Health News .  over the weekend about the issue. She noted that many patients have trouble getting their mental health care covered, and she outlined some of the issues confronting both patients and the insurance industry. Here is an edited transcript of her comments.. It’s been a mixed bag so far. Insurance companies often used to have a separate deductible or a higher copay for mental health and substance abuse visits.  Right now, that usually isn’t the case. In that way, insurers really have complied.. But in more subtle ways , advocates are saying they’re really not complying. For example, insurance companies, in order to keep down costs, will do things called “medical necessity” reviews. Basically, they look at someone’s care and ask is it really medically necessary. Advocates say they’re applying those sorts of cost-control techniques more stringently on the mental health side and the substance abuse side than they are on the physical health side. So people are still having trouble getting their care covered.. Insurance companies are arguing this is a really hard law to implement. Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for .  the insurance industry’s main trade group, says the plans are doing their best to make this work.. “The plans have made tremendous steps since the final rules have come out to implement these changes and requirements in a way that is affordable for patients,” Krusing said. “And again this goes back to the fact that we are at a point where health care costs continue to go up.”. She also said that it’s hard to compare mental and physical health care, that those are two really different things, sort of apples and oranges. It’s hard to make them exactly equal when treatment often doesn’t line up, she said, and success can be harder to measure on the mental health side.. Advocates, patients and lawyers say it’s not going well for patients and that we’ve got something that looks like mental health parity in name only. A .  poll found that consumers said they were twice as likely to get their mental health care denied than their medical care, which suggests that insurance companies still aren’t equating the two.. Carol McDaid, an advocate who runs the . , noted that her group has a helpline to take complaints from people who are having trouble getting their care covered. “They end up with this perception that they have access to care, but when they’re in a crisis for themselves or their loved one, lo and behold, the care’s not available because of these cost-control techniques,” McDaid said.. It’s hard for people to bring a complaint. To prove there’s been a violation, you have to look at how an insurance company makes decisions on the mental health side and then compare that to how they make determinations for medical and surgical treatments. And insurance companies often won’t give up those documents to be analyzed.. In addition, for a consumer to make a complaint, it means coming forward and acknowledging that they have a mental illness. There’s still a lot of stigma about these conditions. Sometimes it’s hard for people to step forward, especially when it means telling their employers.. There are a handful of states that are taking some enforcement actions, including New York, which has reached . with some insurance companies, and California. Also, there are many individual and class action lawsuits against insurance companies alleging that they are violating mental health and substance abuse parity law. And so that may end up being the way it starts getting enforced.|Mon Apr 06 18:04:24 +0000 2015||Battle For Mental Health Parity Produces Mixed Results  |5.851410158934508e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/battle-for-mental-health-parity-produces-mixed-results/
|The 30,000-plus people who work for .  will have only one option for insurance next year, and it requires them to pay up to $5,600 a year out of pocket. For family coverage that risk rises to $11,200.. The move by the Charlotte area’s largest employer spotlights a trend that’s sweeping the country: As more people get health insurance, more people with insurance face potentially devastating medical bills.. The cost-sharing shift has been building for years. Now it’s snowballing to include some of the region’s biggest employers, from hospitals to banks to public schools.. Proponents say greater cost-sharing promotes healthy behavior and drives down medical spending. Some employers contribute to savings accounts for medical expenses and pay workers for such actions as avoiding tobacco and getting health screenings.. “I think these high-deductible plans are going to become more the norm. They do reward folks who take good care of themselves,” said Joseph Piemont, chief operating officer for Carolinas HealthCare.. In a typical year, many employees can save money on the new arrangements, which have lower monthly premiums than traditional plans. But medical crises can’t always be avoided or budgeted.. David Frick of Waxhaw, a 50-year-old case worker for a company that manages worker’s compensation benefits, was healthy and financially stable until Dec. 1, when a trip to the emergency room with abdominal cramps ended with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (see accompanying story). He maxed out the $11,000 in out-of-pocket costs on his workplace policy for 2014, and quickly started piling up more bills in 2015.. Even after tapping retirement savings and getting help from family, friends and their church, he and his wife, P.J., still owe more than $10,000.. “We work professional jobs. We’re educated. We did everything right,” Frick said. “We have no control over it.”. Less than half of all households above the poverty level have enough assets to cover an out-of-pocket maximum of $3,000 to $6,000, considered a moderate level, according to .  by the Kaiser Family Foundation.. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .  that medical debt is the biggest factor in negative credit reports – and about half of the people turned over to collectors for medical bills have otherwise clean records.. This all took root over the past decade. Medical costs and insurance premiums kept growing while the economy crumbled. Employers shifted costs to employees, even as wages stagnated.. One option was to bump up deductibles – the amount a customer must pay before insurance kicks in. Beyond that, the consumer may pay a per-visit fee and/or a percentage of the bill. The total exposure can add up to thousands, especially for family coverage.. “I thought these (high-deductible plans) would never fly because of the employee resistance,” said Cathy Graham, benefit services director for . , a Charlotte-based human resources firm. “I’m still a skeptic. It penalizes those who don’t have the money to go to the doctor or get that prescription filled.”. Ideally, having “skin in the game” pushes patients to make smarter choices, such as having elective procedures done in a doctor’s office instead of a hospital or going to an urgent care center instead of an emergency room for minor ailments..  cost-sharing reins in spending, but patients are as likely to skip valuable treatment, such as drugs and doctor visits for chronic conditions, as they are to pass up unnecessary or overpriced care.. Stacie Dusetzina, an assistant professor in UNC-Chapel Hill’s schools of pharmacy and health policy, did a .  that found about one in six leukemia patients stopped potentially life-saving medication during the first six months because they couldn’t afford it.. “When they’re initially getting treatment, (cancer patients) can easily rack up $10,000 in a very short amount of time,” she said. And for leukemia patients taking . , those costs continue for years.. The Affordable Care Act, approved in 2010, changed the landscape. It mandates that preventive services such as checkups, cancer screenings and immunizations be fully covered regardless of deductibles. Since subsidized policies kicked in last year, more than 16 million uninsured Americans got coverage – some of them getting aid with out-of-pocket costs as well as premiums.. Other aspects of the act helped drive up insurance costs. Insurance companies can no longer deny coverage or boost rates for people with costly conditions, and all policies have to meet federal standards for coverage. Employers must keep adult children on parents’ policies longer. And a “Cadillac tax” that takes effect on high-cost plans in 2018 prompted many companies to trim spending in advance.. Even on traditional plans, out-of-pocket costs have been creeping up. Most employers in the Charlotte region now offer high-deductible plans alongside other options, said Graham of The Employers Association.. Often they’re coupled with accounts that let employees save for out-of-pocket costs. Some companies contribute, either as straight payments or as a reward for participating in activities designed to improve their health.. The popularity of these plans varies. At Duke Energy, which has been promoting high-deductible plans with savings accounts and incentives for five years, 64 percent go that route, said spokesman David Scanzoni. That’s partly because the difference in premiums is significant – up to $6,500 a year for a family plan.. But when the State Health Plan, which covers almost 577,000 teachers and other government employees, rolled out a high-deductible option this year, only about 3 percent signed up. In Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, with more than 15,000 employees covered by the state plan, fewer than 700 took the new option, or just under 4.5 percent, says Vincent Smith, an executive director in the district’s human resources department.. The traditional plan covers 70 percent of expenses and carries a high out-of-pocket risk. Almost half of all state employees instead opt to pay higher premiums for an alternative that pays 80 percent and sets a lower cap on out-of-pocket spending.. When Carolinas HealthCare introduced its high-deductible plan in 2013, only about 5 percent took it. This year it’s up to 25 percent, with the rest choosing a traditional plan with higher premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs, said human resources Vice President Mick Fisher.. During open enrollment for 2015, the company informed its employees they’d no longer have that choice starting in 2016. Nationally, 30 percent of employers said a high-deductible plan would be the only option offered to their staff in 2015, double the rate in 2014, according to a Towers Watson/National Business Group on Health . .. “There’s a clear trend of that happening in all industries,” Fisher said. “We feel it’s a better option. It puts more skin in the game for them to make good decisions.”. Compared with CHS’ traditional plan, premiums are $1,054 a year lower for individuals and $1,542 lower for family coverage. The system encourages employees to put that money into a health savings account. CHS also contributes at least $350 per employee or $1,100 per family to that account, with the chance to earn another $1,000 for wellness activities.. For workers who earn less than $30,000 a year, CHS pays a bigger share of premiums and adds $100 to the savings account.. The financial impact on CHS remains to be seen. Because the system is self-insured, the drop in premiums will reduce income. But if employees are motivated to save money by using care wisely and staying healthier, the move could eventually help control costs, said spokesman Kevin McCarthy.. Experts agree: The days when a good job meant never having to worry about medical bills are gone.. As the cost-shifting trend continues, the question becomes what to do about people who don’t get the care they need because they can’t afford a few hundred – or thousand – dollars in medical bills.. CHS is not just an employer trying to cut costs. It’s also a health-care provider that absorbed .  in unpaid bills and charity care last year. Officials say some of that comes from people who have insurance but can’t pay their share.. Novant Health, the Charlotte area’s other big health-care system, has used what it calls a hybrid plan for the last five years: A high-deductible medical plan paired with traditional co-pay coverage for medications. Benefits director Shannon Nevergall said the company realized that making employees pay large amounts for drugs made it less likely they’d fill prescriptions, which can worsen their health.. Some experts hope to see insurance companies and/or the government refine the approach to out-of-pocket spending. For instance, treatment for asthma, diabetes and other chronic conditions might be exempted from deductibles in the belief that it will save money in the long run. But employee costs for medical care with less obvious value might continue to rise.. Dusetzina, the UNC cancer researcher, says she considers the approach promising. But when it comes to something such as cancer treatment, she adds, there’s always going to be tension over what it costs, how much good it does and who should pay.|Mon Apr 06 17:19:44 +0000 2015||High-Deductible Health Plans Can Ruin Finances |5.851297765218796e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/high-deductible-health-plans-can-ruin-finances/

In fact, there are few winners: out of 1,010 large physician groups that the government evaluated, just 14 are getting payment increases this year, . . Losers also are scarce. Only 11 groups will be getting reductions for low quality or high spending.. “We performed well, but not enough for the bonus,” said Kitchell, a neurologist. “My sense of disappointment here is really significant. Why even bother?”. Within three years, the .  of care to be considered in allocating nine of every 10 dollars Medicare pays directly to providers to treat the elderly and disabled. One part of that effort is well underway: .  based on excess readmissions, patient satisfaction and other quality measures. Expanding this approach to physicians is touchier, as many are suspicious of the government judging them and reluctant to share performance metrics that Medicare requests.. “Without having any indication that this is improving patient care, they just keep piling on additional requirements,” said Dr. Mark Donnell, an anesthesiologist in Silver City, N.M. Donnell said he only reports a third of the quality measures he is expected to. “So much of what’s done in medicine is only done to meet the requirements,” he said.. The new financial incentive for doctors, called a . , allows the federal government to boost or lower the amount it reimburses doctors based on how they score on quality measures and how much their patients cost Medicare. How doctors rate this year will determine payments for more than 900,000 physicians by 2017.. Medicare is easing doctors into the program, applying it this year only to medical groups with . , including doctors, nurses, speech-language pathologists and occupational therapists. Next year the program expands Medicare to groups of 10 or more health professionals. In 2017, all remaining doctors who take Medicare—along with about 360,000 other health professionals—will be included. By early in the next decade, 9 percent of the payments Medicare makes to doctors and other professionals would be at risk under a bill that the House of Representatives passed in March.. The quality metrics used to judge doctors vary by specialty. One test looks at how consistently doctors keep an accurate list of all the drugs patients were taking. Others track the rate of complications after cataract surgery or whether patients received recommended treatments for particular cancers.. There are more than 250 quality measures. Groups and doctors must report a selection —generally nine, which they choose — or else be automatically penalized. This year, 319 large medical groups are having their reimbursements reduced by 1 percent because they did not meet Medicare’s reporting standards.. Physicians who do report their quality data fear the measures are sometimes misguided, usually a hassle and may encourage doctors to avoid poorer and sicker patients, who tend to have more trouble controlling asthma or staying on antidepressants, for instance.. Dr. Leanne Chrisman-Khawam, a primary care doctor in Cleveland, said many of her patients have difficulty just getting to follow-up appointments, since they must take two or three buses. She said those battling obesity or diabetes are less likely to reform their diets to emphasize fresh foods, which are expensive and less available in poor neighborhoods. “You’re going to link that physician’s payment to that life?” she asked.. Dr. Hamilton Lempert, an emergency room doctor in Cincinnati, criticized one measure that requires him to track how often he follows up with patients with high blood pressure.. “Most everyone’s blood pressure is elevated in the emergency department because they’re anxious,” Lempert said. Another metric encourages testing the heart’s electrical impulses in patients with non-traumatic chest pain, which Lempert said has led emergency rooms to give priority to these cases over more serious ones.. “It’s just very frustrating, the things we have to do to jump through the hoops,” he said.. In their first year doctors are affected by the program, they can choose to forgo bonuses or penalties based on their performance. After that, the program is mandatory. This year, 564 groups opted out, but even if all of them had been included, only 3 percent would have gotten increases and 38 percent would have seen lower payments, mostly for not satisfactorily reporting quality measures, Medicare data show.. Smaller groups and solo practitioners are even less likely to report quality to the government. “The participation rates, even though it’s mandated, are just really low,” said Dr. Alyna Chien, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. It’s “a level of analytics that just is not typically built into a doctor’s office.”. Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, chief medical officer of The Advisory Board, a consulting group, predicted more doctors will start reporting their quality scores when the prospect of fines is greater. “They are not going to motivate until it is absolutely necessary,” she said. “If you look at these small practices, a lot of them just run on a shoestring.”. This year’s assessments of big groups were based on patients seen in 2013. A total of $11 million of the $1.2 billion Medicare pays doctors is being given out as bonuses, which translates to a 5 percent payment increase for those 14 groups getting payment increases this year. That money came from low performers and those that did not report quality measures to Medicare’s satisfaction; they are losing up to 1 percent.. The exact amount any of these groups lose will depend on the number and nature of the services they provide over the year. This year, 268 medical groups were exempted because at least one of their doctors was participating in one of the government’s experiments in providing care differently.. Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services declined to be interviewed about the program but said in a prepared statement that they have been . showing their quality and costs. “We hope that this information will provide meaningful and actionable information to physicians so that they may improve the coordination and integration of the health care provided to beneficiaries,” the statement said.|Mon Apr 06 13:56:12 +0000 2015||Medicare Is Stingy In First Year Of Doctor Bonuses  |5.850785573044961e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/medicare-is-stingy-in-first-year-of-doctor-bonuses/
|Until she noticed the tiny blood spots on her sheets, Peg Fagan thought the itchy, raised area on her shoulder was a spider bite.. So when her doctor asked during a routine checkup in April whether Fagan had any health concerns, she mentioned the bite. The doctor took a sample to biopsy. A few days later, Fagan got a call saying she had to come in to the office.. “I said, ‘No, I don’t,’ ” remembered Fagan, 56, a breast cancer survivor. “If you are going to tell me that I have cancer, just tell me.”. Fagan had melanoma, the most serious kind of skin cancer.. The diagnosis was emotionally crushing. But if she had received it a month earlier, before the Independence Blue Cross silver tier Proactive plan she bought through healthcare.gov kicked in, it also would have been financially devastating.. “I don’t know what I would have done if I couldn’t afford to pay for the operation I had last year,” she said. “I would have lost my home.”. Now that she finally has health insurance, Fagan, a personal chef and owner of the Flying Avocado Wholefoods catering business in Ottsville, Philadelphia worries that a Supreme Court ruling could take it away.. “It gets me mad,” she said. “I’m not a slacker. I’m not sitting at home doing nothing all day. I’m paying my taxes and doing the best that I possibly can, but I can’t afford $600 or $700 a month for health insurance.”. If the court rules for the plaintiffs in King vs. Burwell, it will narrow who can receive a subsidy to buy insurance through state-run exchanges. The Rand Corp. and the Urban Institute estimate that will mean up to 8 million low- and middle-class people in 34 states – including Pennsylvania and New Jersey – will lose their federal subsidies.. Since the ACA became law five years ago, more than 16.4 million previously uninsured people are now covered, according to the government. But if almost half lose their government subsidy, the marketplace, and the law, will likely collapse.. While the court debates the case, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced last week that new insurance coverage through marketplace plans or Medicaid expansions had reduced uncompensated hospital care costs by an estimated $7.4 billion.. Most of that saving – $5 billion – is from states that expanded Medicaid.. The marketplace open-enrollment period this year is generally closed, but people filing income taxes and paying a fine because they did not have health insurance last year have until April 30 to get covered for the remainder of 2015. For the 2015 tax year, the penalty for being uninsured is $325 per adult or 2 percent of household income, whichever is greater.. The only other way consumers can buy insurance through the marketplace is due to an event such as marriage, having a baby, or losing job-provided coverage.. “I don’t know what would keep people from signing up,” Fagan said. “It’s not worth not being covered and it’s not hard to sign up.”. Before the ACA, Fagan had been uninsured for five years. Money was tight after she lost her job as a chef. And when preexisting conditions still were a bar to insurance, being a breast cancer survivor put coverage financially out of her reach.. “I was paying out of pocket for everything,” said Fagan, who also has other medical issues. “My medications were costing me almost as much as my unemployment was bringing in.”. Like an overwhelming majority of consumers (81 percent in Pennsylvania and 83 percent in New Jersey), she qualified for a tax credit subsidy ($400) that reduced her monthly premium to $39 last year and $112 this year.. “It was so inexpensive that I couldn’t believe it,” she said.. After getting her melanoma diagnosis last year, Fagan saw a dermatologic oncologist and was quickly scheduled for surgery. While in surgery, she went into anaphylactic shock and was intubated, put on a respirator for several hours, and whisked off to surgical intensive care.. “The thing I think about is what would have happened if I didn’t have insurance,” she said. “This was like $100,000. How could I have ever afforded that?”. With her business growing, Fagan is looking forward to not needing a subsidy. But for now, she needs the help.. “I’m doing the best I can,” she said. “I don’t understand the mean-spiritedness of the people who resent those of us that need some help.”.  |Fri Apr 03 19:21:47 +0000 2015||Cancer Survivor Worries About Supreme Court Ruling On Obamacare Subsidies |5.840733291594465e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/cancer-survivor-worries-about-supreme-court-ruling-on-obamacare-subsidies/

|Even though consumers are digging deeper to cover rising out-of-pocket medical costs, they’re contributing less to health savings accounts that could help take the sting out of their expenses, according to a new. .. Between 2011 and 2014, the percentage of people who said they contributed nothing to their health savings accounts (HSAs) more than doubled, to 23 percent, according to a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Meanwhile, the percentage who said they contributed $1,500 or more dropped to 30 percent from 44 percent.. While the reasons for the decline in contributions are unclear, “one of the things to consider is that these plans have been around for a while now and at some point people may stop contributing if they’ve built up an account balance,” says Paul Fronstin, director of EBRI’s health research and education program. For example, someone with a $5,000 HSA balance whose plan has a $2,000 deductible may feel comfortable he can cover out-of-pocket costs.. Unlike flexible spending account balances, in which money is generally lost if unused at year end, HSA balances accumulate and can be used in future years even if workers change jobs..  were established in 2003 as a way for people to save for future out-of-pocket medical expenses. The money is deposited, accumulates and can be withdrawn tax free. The accounts must be linked to a health plan with a deductible of at least $1,300 for individual coverage and $2,600 for. .. Employers often contribute to workers’ health savings accounts, but the EBRI analysis found that their contributions declined as well. Sixty-seven percent of workers said they received employer contributions in 2014, down from 71 percent in 2013. EBRI’s analysis included both HSAs and health reimbursement arrangements, another type of account to which only employers contribute money for their workers’ health care expenses. In addition, the funds belong to the employer.. As employers continue to shift more health care expenses onto workers’ shoulders, offering high-deductible plans that link to financial accounts has become increasingly popular.. In 2014, 73 percent of companies with more than 1,000 workers offered an account-based health plan, up from 51 percent in 2009, according to the . annual employer health care survey. A third of workers at those companies were enrolled in such accounts in 2014, the survey found, more than double the median 14 percent that were enrolled five years earlier.|Fri Apr 03 18:52:33 +0000 2015||Consumers Contributing Less To Health Savings Accounts, Study Finds  |5.840659718217523e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/consumers-contributing-less-to-health-savings-accounts-study-finds/

|The Affordable Care Act is once again before the Supreme Court.. On March 4, the justices will hear oral arguments in . , a case challenging the validity of tax subsidies helping millions of Americans buy health insurance if they don’t get it through an employer or the government. If the court rules against the Obama administration, those subsidies could be cut off for everyone in the three dozen states using . , the federal exchange website. A decision is expected by the end of June.. Here are five things you should know about the case and its potential consequences:. The Supreme Court has already found the Affordable Care Act is constitutional. That was settled in 2012’s . .. At issue in this case is a .  stipulating that subsidies are available to those who sign up for coverage “through an exchange established by the state.” In issuing .  in 2012, however, the IRS said that subsidies would also be available to those enrolling through the federal health insurance exchange. The agency noted Congress had never discussed limiting the subsidies to state-run exchanges and that making subsidies available to all “is consistent with the language, purpose and structure” of the law as a whole.. Last summer, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond ruled that the .  of the law. While the three-judge panel agreed that the language in the law is “ambiguous,” they relied on so-called “. a legal principle that takes its name from a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that held that courts must defer to a federal agency’s interpretation as long as that interpretation is not unreasonable.. Those challenging the law, however, insist that Congress intended to limit the subsidies to state exchanges. “As an inducement to state officials, the Act authorizes tax credits and subsidies for certain households that purchase health insurance through an Exchange, but restricts those entitlements to Exchanges created by states,” wrote Michael Cannon and Jonathan Adler, two of the fiercest critics of the IRS interpretation, in an .  in the Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.. In any case, a ruling in favor of the challengers would affect only the subsidies available in the states using the federal exchange. Those in the 13 states operating their own exchanges would be unaffected. The rest of the health law, including its expansion of Medicaid and requirements for coverage of those with pre-existing conditions, would remain in effect.. A study by the .  found that if subsidies in the federal health exchange are disallowed, 9.3 million people could lose $28.8 billion of federal help paying for their insurance in just the first year. Since many of those people would not be able to afford insurance without government help, the number of uninsured could rise by 8.2 million people.. A .  from the Urban Institute looked at those in danger of losing their coverage and found that most are low and moderate-income white, working adults who live in the South.. Experts say disallowing the subsidies in the federal exchange states could destabilize the entire individual insurance market, not just the exchanges in those states. Anticipating that only those most likely to need medical services will hold onto their plans, insurers would likely increase premiums for everyone in the state who buys their own insurance, no matter where they buy it from.. “If subsidies [in the federal exchange] are eliminated, premiums would increase by about 47 percent,” said Christine Eibner of the RAND Corporation, who co-authored a .  projecting a 70 percent drop in enrollment.. Eliminating tax subsidies for individuals would also impact the law’s requirement that . . That’s because the penalty for not providing coverage only kicks in if a worker goes to the state health exchange and receives a subsidy. If there are no subsidies, there are also no employer penalties.. Supreme Court decisions generally take effect 25 days after they are issued. That could mean that subsidies would stop flowing as soon as July or August, assuming a decision in late June. Insurers can’t drop people for non-payment of their premiums for 90 days, although they have to continue to pay claims only for the first 30.. Although the law’s requirement that individuals have health insurance would remain in effect, no one is required to purchase coverage if the lowest-priced plan in their area costs more than eight percent of their income. So without the subsidies, and with projected premium increases, many if not most people would become exempt.. All Congress would have to do to restore the subsidies is pass a bill striking the line about subsidies being available through exchanges “established by the state.” But given how many Republicans oppose the law, leaders have already said .  to fix it. Republicans are still working to come up with a contingency plan should the ruling go against the subsidies. Even that will be difficult given their .  over health care.. States could solve the problem by setting up their own exchanges, but that is a .  and in most cases requires the consent of state legislatures. And the Obama administration has no power to step in and fix things either, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a .  to members of Congress.|Mon Mar 02 19:09:41 +0000 2015||5 Things To Know About The Supreme Court Case Challenging The Health Law |5.7247386891432755e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/5-things-to-know-about-the-supreme-court-case-challenging-the-health-law/

|HAYFORK, Calif. — It’s Tuesday morning, half past eight and already hot, when the small bus pulls up to the community clinic. Most of the passengers are waiting in front — an old man with a cane, two mothers with four kids between them, packed lunches in hand.. Two more arrive. A gray-bearded man with a pirate bandana steps from the shelter of his Subaru. A sunken-cheeked woman rushes up on her bike.. “Woohoo! We have a full car!” the driver says brightly after they’ve all climbed aboard. The riders smile back, some with a hint of resignation. It’s time for the weekly trip to the clinic in Mad River, about 30 miles down a winding mountain road near the Trinity Alps. The tight twists and turns are hard on the stomach, but even harder on the joints — especially if you have chronic Lyme disease, as more than a few of these riders do.. Jeff Clarke, the 58-year-old in the black bandana, has Lyme, acquired long ago from deer ticks that dwell in the region’s sprawling forests. But today he’s going to ask about a lump that’s been growing in his left breast. It’s starting to hurt, and he’s worried. His fellow riders list their own ailments matter-of-factly: asthma, dental decay, diabetes, drug addiction, heart disease and much more.. They wouldn’t be making this trip if they didn’t have to. In Hayfork, “we’re down to the remnants of the medical personnel,” says Clarke, a well-spoken musician with a love for science, cats and NPR. “It just came to the point where if I needed to deal with anything important I just felt much more comfortable going over to Mad River.”. Like so many isolated American towns, Hayfork has lost its vitality and much of its youth to bigger places. For all its tree-lined ridges and breathtaking views, Hayfork is well beyond the tourists’ byways — more than an hour from the city of Eureka on the west and Redding on the east. It’s a 45-minute drive just to Weaverville, the tiny Trinity County seat.. Whether they’re too poor to leave or charmed by the star-filled skies, Hayforkers have mostly made their peace with isolation: No retail stores, theaters, museums, fancy restaurants – and Internet access that is iffy at best.. “We were always 20 years behind everything,” says Shannon Barnett, a 41-year-old a former school teacher who grew up here. “We were all just fine with that. Now it’s different.”. She’s referring to the exodus of basic health services.. For decades.  Hayfork had been fortunate. Well after the rise of urban health systems and their intricate business models, it had a tight-knit local “system” founded on the simple, generous commitment of two people: a general practitioner and a pharmacist.. “He was everybody’s doctor,” Barnett says of Dr. Earl Mercill, a GP who moved up from the Central Valley almost 50 years ago. “You never thought about going to anyone else.”. But it’s been years since Mercill retired. Now his clinic is staffed by doctors who rotate in from Weaverville once or twice a week, and otherwise it’s run by physician’s assistants. There are no hospitals for miles, though helicopters swoop in for emergencies when needed.. The Mad River clinic isn’t an ideal alternative.  It’s bigger than Hayfork’s and offers a wider array of services but it’s still staffed mostly by physician’s assistants and about an hour away by bus. It’s so backed up with patients it can take weeks to get an appointment, Clarke says.. In these tiny towns of California’s  far north, lacking insurance is not the biggest obstacle to care. Even before Obamacare took effect, a. , roughly the same as in the rest of the state. A good number are on Medi-Cal.. What’s ailing these people is geography – that, and poverty. The median household income in . , well below the . , according to the American Community Survey.  Unemployment is extraordinarily high – estimates range between .  and . . Many people lack a sturdy car to drive, or even money for gas.. In the federal government’s parlance, Hayfork is a “medically underserved” community – one of roughly 3,500 in the country and 170 in California, according to the federal government’s latest numbers. By definition, these areas have too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, pervasive poverty or a significant elderly population. Some are islands of deprivation within otherwise well-stocked urban areas. Others are dots on the map like Hayfork, far from where doctors and medical services are clustered. According to the National Rural Health Association, . Health care is available on the other side of the mountain, says Greg Schneider, a 65-year-old writer and band mate of Clarke’s. “The problem,” he says, “is getting there.”. In 1967, long after its rise and fall as a gold-mining town, Hayfork struck it rich. That’s when a friend told Mercill, then practicing in tiny Arvin, Calif., that an even tinier town south of Oregon badly needed a doctor.. Mercill was intrigued. He visited a few times with his large and growing family (he and his wife Marianne eventually raised eight kids, four of them adopted).. Hayfork was still a mill town then, filled with lumberjacks and janes, as the women were known. It had restaurants, shops and even a thriving art and music scene.. After praying on the decision, the family moved up north, built a house and settled on 40 acres outside town. A few months afterward, Mercill opened his clinic downtown.. He was beloved almost from the beginning. He made house calls in the middle of the night — sometimes walking over precariously narrow log bridges or shuttling to his patients’ homes by snowmobile.. He delivered babies by flashlight after storms knocked down power and waited by his patients’ bedsides for hours until they felt better, sometimes charging little more than a slice of cake.. “If they didn’t have any money, I saw them,” Mercill recalls, frail now, but with a keen long-term memory. “If they could pay later, fine. If they didn’t, they didn’t. I never went hungry.”. Mercill couldn’t do everything, of course. If a patient needed a specialist or surgery he sent them to colleagues in Redding or Weaverville. Sometimes he drove along with them and assisted in the operating room.. In 1982, pharmacist Gerry Reichelderfer came to Hayfork, also on a friend’s recommendation. He fell in love with mountain life, and took over the drug store next to Mercill’s clinic.. Reichelderfer lived just seven minutes and a single stop sign away from his shop. He’d drive over and open up anytime people needed a prescription. If they couldn’t pay right then, he’d put it on an I.O.U. or let it slide.. The men joined forces, talking daily by intercom. The partnership would last nearly two decades.. In the late 1980s, the logging industry started to crumble. Partly because of pressure from conservation groups, the mills in Northern California dominoed shut. By the time Hayfork’s mill closed in the early 1990s, the population — never higher than the low thousands — had dwindled.. “When all the workers left, they took all the families and young children,” says Rick Simmons of the Trinity County Historical Society.  “What was left over was people unable to go anywhere.”. Homelessness, poverty and drug addiction took hold. An underground market began to sprout around marijuana — bringing drifters, seasonal trimmers and unofficial security forces to town. The forests became a dangerous place to wander.. Clarke, a runaway and hitchhiker in his youth, was in some ways typical of Hayfork’s new generation. He arrived in the 1980s, in the clutches of methamphetamine addiction, a habit he picked up in the bars where he played guitar. For years, he landed jobs and lost them — working as a wood chopper, sandwich maker and cabinet craftsman. He started seeing a woman he met in rehab, then split with her, but not before they had a daughter. They named her Stormy Brooke. He gained custody and lost it more than once.. He wanted to get sober for her, if not himself. Seeing no hope for professional help locally, he drove to a clinic in Weaverville. His first need, he told the counselor at the desk, was housing — a roof over his head.. “He repeatedly said that’s not my job,” Clarke says.. Clarke stopped trying to seek addiction treatment after that. “Most of the progress I’ve made in the last few years has been behind the 12-step stuff I do,” he says.. The meetings at Hayfork’s Solid Rock Church saved his life, he says. He goes every Monday and has been sober 10 years.. His health is ok, considering.  He lost his teeth. His bottom denture wore out long ago and his top one is breaking. He has high blood pressure, a detached bicep and hepatitis C from a jailhouse tattoo. He developed chronic Lyme disease because he wasn’t treated right away with antibiotics.. Nowadays, Clarke lives behind the Trinity County Fairgrounds, in a two-room trailer next to the town cemetery. Supported by $889 a month in disability insurance, he spends his time organizing 12-step meetings, reading library books and science magazines, and volunteering as a sound engineer for gigs at a local coffee shop. On good nights, he gets paid a little. Most important to him, he says, is staying as healthy as possible so he can look after 23-year-old Stormy and her 2-year-old son, Tony, who lives with his dad.. Stormy, a tall beauty too insecure to know it, cuts herself and has made several attempts at suicide. Her porcelain arms bear the scars.. “She has no self-esteem,” Clarke says. “She has no faith in love, or trust for any other human beings. She has some real darkness inside her, you know? I’m sure I’m responsible for a majority of that.”. In June, during a fight with her father, she had what Jeff thought was a stroke. En route to Redding in an ambulance, she started seizing so they put her on a chopper. At the hospital, the doctors said she’d had a stress-induced seizure. After three hours, her doctors released her with a prescription for klonopin to control her seizures and panic attacks, and told her to follow-up with her primary care physician.. “I had to laugh,” Clarke says. “We’re in Hayfork!”. Dr. Mercill hung onto his clinic as long as he could, finally selling it to a doctor based in Weaverville. That doctor recently sold it to Trinity Hospital, part of the Mountain Communities Healthcare District, also based in the city.. The saddened community dedicated a clock to him in the town center.  “It was like a limb being cut off,” Barnett says. ”I know at first I didn’t have another doctor for a long time. Other people didn’t either. They bounced around for a long time.”. Every once in a while, Mercill treated people who asked, but he’s 91 now, and hasn’t done that in years.. Two of Mercill’s kids grew up to be medical professionals – one a dentist, another a physical therapist–but they live and practice in bigger towns. The other children also moved away. One son, Steve, moved back from Southern California 21 years ago to care for his mother before she died. Now he’s caring for his dad.. Reichelderfer carried on at his pharmacy after Mercill retired, lending credit to Clarke and others when he could. But the economics of health care shifted under his feet. His business began to struggle. The reimbursements from insurers were too low, he said, and the clinic next door — a long time ally — began referring patients to bigger stores in Weaverville.. In Trinity County, where Hayfork is located, medical services overall became hard to find. In 2012, according to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, there were .  currently practicing, roughly one per 1,200 residents. Statewide, the ratio is roughly 1 per 300.. Specialists like dentists and psychiatrists are nearly non-existent here. That lack of specialty care – particularly in mental health – wears on some residents. Stormy Clarke says that when she feels a panic attack or depression coming on, she simply tries to breathe deeply and distract herself by keeping busy. She also has a medical marijuana card and smokes regularly.. A county behavioral office offers counseling in Hayfork, but a counselor isn’t there every day and in-person visits are by appointment only. Sometimes the most expedient treatment comes in jail — Clarke calls it the “nudge from the judge.”. He mentions an acquaintance named Robbie, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. Since being released from jail, he’s been off his meds, Clarke says. He walks up and down Hayfork’s main strip along Highway 3, muttering to passers-by about the many people who are after him.. “In cities, you have places like outpatient programs for these types of people to go to, every single day,” said Julie Bussman, a psychologist at the Mad River clinic. “It’s a real hardship for people who are severely mentally ill to live out here because there’s not a lot of resources.”. In August, Bussman quit and moved back to Minnesota, leaving no psychologist for miles.. After the bus pulls into the Mad River clinic — a remodeled blue cottage that used to serve as a the local forest service office — the riders start their wait. They are used to it by now: The kids pull out games and books; the adults chat in the waiting room or by a weathered picnic table on the back lawn.. Everybody has to be seen before the bus can head back.. On this day, Clarke is among the first in line. The physician’s assistant on duty examines his chest lump and advises against a biopsy, an invasive procedure, because he wants to run more tests. Clarke takes the news with some concern.. “I was pretty freaked out. I went in there with the agenda of the biopsy. They wanted to explore other options,” he says afterward.. By the time the bus gets back to Hayfork, it’s mid-afternoon. He drives back to his trailer, frustrated and spent.. A few Tuesdays later, he takes the bus back to Mad River and is referred to a specialist in Weaverville.. It is another two months before he learns the lump is a side effect of the medications he’s taking — a hypothesis he’d mentioned earlier to physicians and their assistants in Hayfork and Mad River.. Now he has to start thinking about replacing those dentures, which means another bus trip — or several – around the mountain.. Reichelderfer, 81 and in failing health, began looking earlier this year for someone to buy his store. He looked for months. Even the independents weren’t interested, in part because pharmacists’ family members weren’t keen on moving to Hayfork.. With great sadness, he shut his doors . “I wish I could have been able to sell it to somebody,” he said, “for the convenience of the people.”. From now on, Hayforkers will have to get a ride to Owens Pharmacy in Weaverville or to Walmart or CVS in Redding.. It took only a few days to board up a drug store open for 32 years.. It’s a relic now, standing just yards from the clock the town dedicated to Dr. Mercill, with his years of service gratefully memorialized on a plaque.|Mon Mar 02 17:52:37 +0000 2015||This town's biggest health care problem isn't insurance -- it's distance.  |5.7245447711614976e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/when-health-care-is-far-from-home/
|BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. — Bayou La Batre calls itself the seafood capital of Alabama. Residents here depend on fishing and shrimping for their livelihood, and when they sit down to eat, they like most things fried.. It’s here that former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin has been trying to reverse the nation’s obesity epidemic one patient at a time. Benjamin grew up near Bayou La Batre and has run a health clinic in this town of seafood workers and ship builders since 1990. As obesity became commonplace around the U.S., health care providers like Benjamin began seeing the impacts of obesity all around them.. “We saw our patient population get heavier,” Benjamin said. “We saw chronic diseases start to rise, and if we continued, our entire community would totally be crippled, basically, based on chronic diseases.”. Two major trends are on a collision course here, as in the rest of the United States: a decades-long surge in obesity and the aging of the U.S. population. Today, one out of every three adults in the U.S. are clinically obese, and many who have lived for decades with excess weight, diabetes and heart disease are now heading into their senior years. Obese people are far more likely to become sick or disabled as they age, and researchers say this burgeoning demographic will strain hospitals and nursing homes.. “We’re potentially going to have a larger, older population that’s more likely to be obese, surviving longer with cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases,” said Dr. Virginia Chang, a demographer at New York University. “I think that the primary fallout from increasing obesity is probably not going to be some huge hit to mortality. It’s going to be disability.”. Those consequences may already be visible, researchers say. Lifelong obesity, now common across the country, is poised to undermine improvements in disability rates among older adults.. Steven Austad, chairman of the biology department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, studies the effects of diet and nutrition on aging using mice. He says researchers used to think that aging was driven by different processes. “Your heart aged, your brain aged, your feet aged,” he said. “But now, we’ve realized, there’s a handful of processes that are involved in aging all parts of your body. And it turns out, one of those processes is inflammation.”. Inflammation naturally increases as we age, but that process is exacerbated by belly fat, which secretes chemicals that cause further inflammation around the body. “If you’re obese, then your system-wide levels of inflammation are higher, particularly when you get older,” said Austad.. That’s one reason scientists think men and women who are obese are more likely to develop dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and certain cancers as they age.. Bob Parker, a Birmingham area resident, says his own weight is starting to catch up with him. As a realtor and Democratic party activist, he often attends meetings at restaurants and says all those nights dining out make it hard to eat well. Now, at age 60, he’s being treated for diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and sleep apnea. He’s lost 90 pounds—twice—and gained it back. “It’s taken some energy away, for sure,” Parker said of his weight. “I like to do things out in the yard and I just can’t work on them as much. So, that’s pretty galling to be honest.”. Obesity is an expensive disease, especially for aging seniors. One study found that while obese 70-year-olds live as long as healthy weight 70-year-olds, they will spend $39,000 more on health care. “Obese people have higher healthcare costs than non-obese people. This is true virtually throughout life,” said David Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. As a person gets into the age when health care spending goes up, “that difference is going to be bigger and bigger and more and more important.”. In part because of disability and poor health, surveys show more obese people are heading into nursing homes at younger ages and staying longer than non-obese residents. Two hours from Birmingham, in the northwest corner of the state, Generations of Red Bay is one of the only nursing homes in the region that is willing to take on the added expense of caring for heavier residents. Patients come from as far away as Texas.. Margaret Hilldouglas arrived here two years ago, at age 47, after she broke her knee. Surgery was considered too risky because of her congestive heart failure, so she languished in a hospital for weeks while a social worker looked for a nursing home that would accept her.. Patients like Hilldouglas require additional staff and costly equipment, including specialized beds, mechanical lifts, larger blood pressure cuffs and longer needles, said Aundrea Fuller, chief operating officer of Generations of Red Bay. “There are two certified nursing assistants for eight to ten residents. And that’s about twice the staffing that you would have for the general population of a skilled nursing facility.” Most of the obese residents that move in here, even the younger ones, will need this type of care for the rest of their lives, Fuller said.. At the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s weight loss clinic, Bernard Rayford, 55, said he wants to avoid that fate. “I’ve always prayed, Lord, before I be a burden, just take me. I saw myself being a burden, and me being a major problem,” Rayford said after a vigorous workout in the clinic’s gym. “The end was for me not to make it. Or for me to end up being in an ambulance. And that’s, that’s the direction I don’t want to be in.”|Mon Mar 02 17:30:52 +0000 2015||The Extra Cost Of Extra Weight For Older Adults |5.724490032432456e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/the-extra-cost-of-extra-weight-for-older-adults/
|Twenty-nine percent of children taken from their families and placed in foster care failed to receive at least one required medical checkup, the Health and Human Services Department Office of the Inspector General said in a .  out today.. Such screenings can help spot health problems, including troubles with vision, hearing, development and mental health issues.. Those exams are particularly important for children in foster care because some have suffered neglect, abuse and other problems that could affect their health.. States set their own requirements, with many mandating that children be screened by medical staff within 24 hours of their placement in foster care – and again periodically under specific schedules that vary with age.. But the report — which looked at medical records in California, Illinois, New York and Texas — found that 12 percent of foster children didn’t get their initial checkup and another 17 percent did not get one or more of the periodic assessments required.. “Missing or late screenings may prevent children’s mental health needs, physical health needs, and developmental needs from being identified and treated,” OIG spokesman Mary M. Kahn said in a written statement.. The reviewed records were from July 2011 to June 2012. The report does not break out the specific failure rate in each state.. Most children in foster care qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal health program for the poor.

|When choosing a doctor, patients have long relied on the idea of board certification. It’s a stamp of approval meant to assure them their provider knows current medical practices.. But a rebellion among doctors over recertification requirements has put that stamp in flux, potentially complicating what patients can expect to know about their doctors.. The national credentialing organization has directed the 24 boards that oversee specific medical specialties, such as surgeons, anesthesiologists and internal medicine doctors, to toughen their requirements for renewal of board certification. But pushback from a number of doctors — especially internists — has sparked a debate in the medical community about the best way to evaluate what doctors know and how effective they are at treating patients.. Specialist and primary care doctors who want to stay board certified – a guideline hospitals and insurance plans often look to when evaluating a physician’s quality – already must pass a written exam every 10 years and take classes intended to keep them studying medicine. But the .  is seeking to boost those efforts.. Following the ABMS guidance, the American Board of Internal Medicine last year moved to add a new component to its maintenance of certification program, requiring certified internists to provide information every five years about how they interact with patients and keep them safe. That was supposed to start this year. But the .  it elicited from a number of doctors led the . .. Now, the board is starting over, soliciting more input, said Richard Baron, ABIM’s president.. All 24 specialty boards have been required to expand maintenance of certification. Internal medicine, which is the largest of the groups, is the only one so far to suspend its requirements. However, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a trade group of private physicians that advocates limiting government influence on medical care and more independence for individual doctors, filed a lawsuit against ABMS challenging the recertification efforts in all specialties in 2013. The U.S. District Court in Chicago is weighing  the suit.. But while many internists have praised the ABIM decision to take a harder look at what’s required to maintain board certification, patient advocates have expressed concern that the move could potentially foreshadow a diminished focus on elements like patient safety.. “ABIM is issuing a mea culpa to physicians, that they’ve held them to too many standards,” said Leah Binder, president of the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit organization that emphasizes patient safety. “And I think that message has some hazards to it.”. More thorough standards for physicians are worth the effort, said Robert Wachter, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco who previously chaired ABIM and is now a trustee at the ABIM Foundation, the board’s nonprofit arm. The board, he said, correctly thought that “the public deserved and would want to know that physicians were doing more [to stay certified] than a process that they were doing for a few months every 10 years.”. The goal was to develop ways to assess patient care and patients’ perceptions of their doctors.. Physicians say, however, they were worried that, as proposed, ABIM’s requirements could be too cumbersome without effectively measuring quality. They would have been required to review old charts and paperwork every five years, collecting data to indicate what they had done in treating relevant diseases, as well as surveying patients about the level of care they received.. Doctors “viewed this as a significant burden – very time-consuming,” said Steven Weinberger, CEO of the American College of Physicians, and at the same time, “they weren’t really clear that it actually improved the practices of medicine and the care that they gave to patients.”. And such criticism, Wachter said, convinced board members that “the methods we had to assess those things were too imperfect and too onerous to force physicians to do them right now.”. But some have said even the existing process is too expensive – completing the ABIM protocol for maintenance of certification, including the exam, costs about $2,000 every decade. Others have argued the exam doctors must take, for which the content is also being re-evaluated, isn’t always relevant, a qualm that could suggest it is not worth the energy and expense of completing.  For instance, a physician who works only with breast cancer patients might still be required to demonstrate knowledge about prostate cancer, colon cancer or other forms of the disease.. “How relevant do you need to make the exam?” Weinberger said. “Does the certificate say that I’m in fact competent in a broader area? It’s a very nuanced question.”. But despite these reservations, finding a way to somehow hold doctors accountable is essential when it comes to patient safety, Binder said.. “We are in an environment where there are so many significant problems in quality and safety in health care,” she said. “I hope they will turn around quickly and that the new standards they set will be more appropriate and at the same time tougher.”. The prevalence of organizations assessing doctors actually makes a strong board credential more important, Wachter argued.. “We wanted to create a process that we thought was appropriate and credible for the public” and that others could use as a gold standard for evaluating physicians, Wachter said.. And though continuing medical education (CME) programs  already exist, they aren’t a substitute for being certified, Weinberger said, especially given how relatively unstandardized the courses can be. “When you’ve seen one CME program, you’ve seen one CME program – they’re all very different in terms of what their goals are and how effective their goals are.”. Balancing physician and consumer needs can get tricky, Binder said, but effective and stringent standards are important given the significance doctors hold in patients’ lives.. “Physicians are an elite profession – one that is revered and admired by all of us,” she said. “And in return for that admiration and respect, I think, they should reassure us that they are holding themselves to very high standards.”|Fri Feb 27 21:59:02 +0000 2015||Internists Get A Break From Controversial Efforts To Bolster Performance |5.7142932743644365e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/internists-get-a-break-from-controversial-efforts-to-bolster-performance/
|"Mary Agnes Carey speaks with Melissa Attias of CQ- Roll Call about Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell’s visit to Capitol Hill, where she faced a torrent of questions about the pending Supreme Court case concerning health law subsidies and the impact the ruling might have on the millions of people who have subsidized coverage.. 
. : Welcome to Health on the Hill, I’m Mary Agnes Carey.  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell faced some tough questioning today on Capitol Hill about the upcoming Supreme Court arguments concerning health law subsidies that help millions of people afford coverage. With us now is Melissa Attias, who was at that House hearing and covers health care for CQ-Roll Call. Thanks for joining us.. : Thanks for having me.. : As expected, several Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee asked Sec. Burwell about how the administration intends to respond if the court rules that people in about three dozen exchanges that are run by the federal government are no longer entitled to get subsidies to help purchase coverage. But subcommittee Chairman Joe Pitts asked the secretary about an alleged 100-page HHS document detailing potential actions that the agency could take if the court rules that the subsidies can’t exist in federal exchanges. What was her response?. : Pitts asked about this document. He said he had heard from a source within HHS that it exists, and Burwell said she was not aware of the document. She instead cited a letter that she sent out to Republican offices on Capitol Hill Tuesday that said her department doesn’t know of any administrative action that could undo the damage that would happen if the court ruled against the government and that therefore they don’t have a plan that could accomplish that kind of action. And she also reiterated that she thinks the Obama administration is going to prevail in the court case. The Supreme Court is going to hold oral arguments next week, March 4, and a ruling is expected by the end of June.. : Hasn’t the administration acted before in the sense of changing requirements on the employer mandate – is one that comes to mind – or the special enrollment period they just created for people who find out they owe a penalty this year because they didn’t have health coverage? Why doesn’t that power extend to having an answer on the subsidy issue?. : The administration has already taken a number of actions administratively to smooth implementation of the law, you named the employer mandate; that’s a great example, so I think it would surprise many people if the administration isn’t making some sort of contingency plan, because most would expect that the administration is going to do anything they can to soften the blow if the subsidies are taken away from the federal exchange.. : While Republicans focus their questions today on the upcoming Supreme Court case, Democrats looked into a different area. Can you tell us about that?.  Sure, Democrats were asking Burwell, whether she was aware of any Republican plans that provide comparable coverage to the Health Care law and they repeatedly tried to hammer home that point one after another. Congressman Eliot Engle who is a New York Democrat urged lawmakers to pass legislation if the court rules against the administration to make sure that people can continue to get affordable coverage through the health exchange. He said that’s what Democrats intended and congressman Kurt Schrader of Oregon also said he thinks its ironic that Republicans keep asking for the administration’s contingency plans for the case, but he thinks it Congress’ responsibility and noted that the Republicans control both chambers of Congress right now.  Democrats also pointed out that Republicans are the ones supporting the lawsuit. Chairman Pitts of the health subcommittee for example is one of those who has signed on to a friend of the court brief in support of the challenge..   Chairman Pitts also asked about an issue in California that deals with health insurers and abortion coverage. What’s happening there?.   Pitts said he was deeply concerned about a lack of HHS action in California, where there is a new policy for health plans to cover abortion. And Pitts said that policy is in violation of the Weldon amendment; that refers to an amendment that’s attached to annual spending bills and it bars funding for a federal agency or state or local government and I’m going to quote here and the quote is that : “Subjects any institutional or individual health entity to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of or refer for abortion,.“ So Burwell said they have opened an investigation within the office for civil rights and that they take the issue seriously. The issue also came up at a house appropriations sub-committee hearing yesterday.. : I want to ask you about another item that came up at the hearing I know it’s on your radar screen. We’ve talked about it before.  This is the sustainable growth rate; the way Medicare pays physicians. The current formula expires at the end of March. What’s new there?. : Lawmakers came up with a bipartisan compromise on the policy last year. But they weren’t able to find a way to pay for it, so they went with a patch as you mentioned which as you mentioned expires at the end of March.  The cost of the policy proposal recently went up by $30.5 billion earlier this month because the Congressional Budget Office added another year to the budget window compared to an estimate the Congressional Budget Office released in November. And the latest estimate is that the cost $174.5 billion from fiscal 2015 to 2025.  At the hearing Congressman Michael Burgess, who’s a Texas republican, said he’s looking at the Medicare changes President Obama proposes his budget for offsets.. : Thank you Melissa Attias of CQ-Roll Call. : Thanks for having me."|Fri Feb 27 21:23:41 +0000 2015||HHS Secretary Burwell Is Grilled About Health Law Contingency Plans |5.7142042776089805e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/hhs-sec-burwell-faces-stiff-questioning-over-health-law-contingency-plans/
|The Affordable Care Act is once again before the Supreme Court.. On March 4, the justices will hear oral arguments in . , a case challenging the validity of tax subsidies helping millions of Americans buy health insurance if they don’t get it through an employer or the government. If the court rules against the Obama administration, those subsidies could be cut off for everyone in the three dozen states using . , the federal exchange website. A decision is expected by the end of June.. Here are five things you should know about the case and its potential consequences:. The Supreme Court has already found the Affordable Care Act is constitutional. That was settled in 2012’s . .. At issue in this case is a .  stipulating that subsidies are available to those who sign up for coverage “through an exchange established by the state.” In issuing .  in 2012, however, the IRS said that subsidies would also be available to those enrolling through the federal health insurance exchange. The agency noted Congress had never discussed limiting the subsidies to state-run exchanges and that making subsidies available to all “is consistent with the language, purpose and structure” of the law as a whole.. Last summer, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond ruled that the .  of the law. While the three-judge panel agreed that the language in the law is “ambiguous,” they relied on so-called “. a legal principle that takes its name from a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that held that courts must defer to a federal agency’s interpretation as long as that interpretation is not unreasonable.. Those challenging the law, however, insist that Congress intended to limit the subsidies to state exchanges. “As an inducement to state officials, the Act authorizes tax credits and subsidies for certain households that purchase health insurance through an Exchange, but restricts those entitlements to Exchanges created by states,” wrote Michael Cannon and Jonathan Adler, two of the fiercest critics of the IRS interpretation, in an .  in the Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.. In any case, a ruling in favor of the challengers would affect only the subsidies available in the states using the federal exchange. Those in the 13 states operating their own exchanges would be unaffected. The rest of the health law, including its expansion of Medicaid and requirements for coverage of those with pre-existing conditions, would remain in effect.. A study by the .  found that if subsidies in the federal health exchange are disallowed, 9.3 million people could lose $28.8 billion of federal help paying for their insurance in just the first year. Since many of those people would not be able to afford insurance without government help, the number of uninsured could rise by 8.2 million people.. A .  from the Urban Institute looked at those in danger of losing their coverage and found that most are low and moderate-income white, working adults who live in the South.. Experts say disallowing the subsidies in the federal exchange states could destabilize the entire individual insurance market, not just the exchanges in those states. Anticipating that only those most likely to need medical services will hold onto their plans, insurers would likely increase premiums for everyone in the state who buys their own insurance, no matter where they buy it from.. “If subsidies [in the federal exchange] are eliminated, premiums would increase by about 47 percent,” said Christine Eibner of the RAND Corporation, who co-authored a .  projecting a 70 percent drop in enrollment.. Eliminating tax subsidies for individuals would also impact the law’s requirement that . . That’s because the penalty for not providing coverage only kicks in if a worker goes to the state health exchange and receives a subsidy. If there are no subsidies, there are also no employer penalties.. Supreme Court decisions generally take effect 25 days after they are issued. That could mean that subsidies would stop flowing as soon as July or August, assuming a decision in late June. Insurers can’t drop people for non-payment of their premiums for 90 days, although they have to continue to pay claims only for the first 30.. Although the law’s requirement that individuals have health insurance would remain in effect, no one is required to purchase coverage if the lowest-priced plan in their area costs more than eight percent of their income. So without the subsidies, and with projected premium increases, many if not most people would become exempt.. All Congress would have to do to restore the subsidies is pass a bill striking the line about subsidies being available through exchanges “established by the state.” But given how many Republicans oppose the law, leaders have already said .  to fix it. Republicans are still working to come up with a contingency plan should the ruling go against the subsidies. Even that will be difficult given their .  over health care.. States could solve the problem by setting up their own exchanges, but that is a .  and in most cases requires the consent of state legislatures. And the Obama administration has no power to step in and fix things either, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a .  to members of Congress.|Fri Feb 27 21:14:35 +0000 2015||5 Things To Know About The Supreme Court Case Challenging The Health Law |5.7141813735634534e+17|http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/5-things-to-know-about-the-supreme-court-case-challenging-the-health-law/

|California’s Medi-Cal program has grown to cover nearly half of the state’s children, causing policymakers and child advocates to question the ability of the taxpayer-funded program to adequately serve so many poor kids.. In the past two years alone, the program has added nearly 1 million young people up to age 20,  including those newly eligible for Medi-Cal coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The increase brings the total number of young people on Medi-Cal to 5.2 million, more than ever before.. Medi-Cal is California’s version of Medicaid and the largest program of its kind in the nation.. Many pediatricians and specialists already refuse to accept new Medi-Cal patients, at least in part because the program offers among the lowest payment rates in the country. New rate cuts took effect this January. Health care advocates say adding more children to the mix will only worsen the likelihood of timely treatment.. Evidence is emerging that the public insurance program is falling short in some key respects. According to an ongoing study led by Ninez Ponce at UCLA and funded by the California Healthcare Foundation, children on Medi-Cal were five times more likely than kids on private plans to have visited the emergency department for asthma care because they couldn’t see their own doctor.. And according to a state .  based on 2013 data, more than two-thirds of California’s Medicaid managed care plans performed below the national average for Medicaid plans in ensuring that children had required immunizations by age 2.. Advocates and some policymakers say the state has downplayed problems with children’s care and not provided adequate data to help evaluate and improve services. They say officials have traditionally paid more attention to Medi-Cal’s more costly adult population.. “When you have half of all of California’s children in Medi-Cal, it’s essential that the state keeps its promises to children that they can get access to the care that they need. This is our future,” said state Sen. Richard Pan, D- Sacramento, a pediatrician who has been pushing the agency to provide better data on children’s care.. State officials say they are working to improve access to care for children but do not see widespread problems or a need to raise reimbursement rates.. “At this time, we feel the rates are sufficient,” said Anastasia Dodson, associate director of policy at the California Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal.. Over the past two years, Medi-Cal absorbed about 750,000 children when California eliminated its Healthy Families child health insurance program, which was aimed at working families with higher incomes than the Medi-Cal population.  An additional 232,000 children joined with the expansion of Medi-Cal under the Affordable Care Act, according to a spokesman for the health care services department.. Nearly all of these children are enrolled in managed care plans, which pay a fixed monthly rate per patient in an effort to save money and streamline care.  Most families pay small monthly premiums for each child depending on income.. The transition from Healthy Families, which generally .  to doctors,  saved  about $39 million in the 2013-2014 budget year, said Dodson, less than the agency’s initial estimate of $52 million. (Overall, the Medi-Cal budget is projected to be $95.4 billion in 2015-2016.). The transition went smoothly for many families, but had its share of serious challenges.. Some children lost access to critical services, such as autism behavioral therapies, that had been previously covered by Healthy Families. The autism services were eventually restored, but advocates faulted the Department of Health Care Services for being slow to react, and families are still dealing with the fallout of trying to regain services for their children.. Glaiza Santiago of San Jose lost autism therapy for her 6-year-old son, Ernesto, for about a year after her children were transferred from Healthy Families to Medi-Cal. Only after filing complaints with her managed care plan, Santa Clara Family Health Plan, and the Department of Health Care Services was she able to get Ernesto reevaluated so that his therapy could resume.. “It’s just been a battle to get him therapy and the other things that he needs,” said Santiago, who has two other young children and is studying to become a medical assistant. “I felt so helpless…I never realized it would be that hard. I never had problems before.”. Other families have experienced long waits for care, particularly dental services.. Diana Vega, an elementary school teacher in San Pablo, has mixed feelings about her three children’s experience with Medi-Cal managed care. She appreciates that her premiums to participate in the program have declined by about 25 percent since switching from Healthy Families; her kids also were able to keep their pediatrician.. Like Santiago, she had trouble restoring therapy services for her son, diagnosed with autism and Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic condition that weakens muscles. But she also was taken aback by how much more difficult it was to get eyeglasses and dental care.. After waiting nearly eight months for an appointment with a dentist who would accept her children’s Denti-Cal insurance, Vega said, the dentist said the insurance would not pay for him to fill a small cavity in her daughter’s mouth because it wasn’t yet “visible to the eye.” So Vega purchased a separate dental insurance policy for her children and abandoned Denti-Cal.. Medi-Cal’s dental services have drawn particular criticism, including a .  released in December that found that dental services had been provided to less than half of the program’s children, mostly because so few dentists were willing to accept the low reimbursement rates.. Dodson of the health care services department said that families can call a telephone service center (800-322-6384) when they are having problems finding a dentist or a timely appointment with any provider, and the state is working to recruit new dentists willing to accept new Denti-Cal patients.. Dodson said her agency regularly monitors the networks of Medi-Cal managed care plans to ensure there are enough doctors to care for patients and that she has not heard of widespread problems for children who need specialty care.  Efforts are underway statewide to increase the number of doctors willing to accept Medi-Cal patients, particularly in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where the Inland Empire Health Plan is .  to treat its members.. The agency also is working with a new committee of experts, the Medi-Cal Children’s Health Advisory Panel, to develop better pediatric data that will help identify any gaps in care, she said.. At the panel’s first meeting in January, Sen. Pan, who pushed legislation to create the panel – .  – cast the stakes for the committee’s work in stark terms:. “When you’re covering half of California’s children, it’s hardly ‘those kids’ anymore,” he said. “It’s all our kids.'”|Thu Jan 29 21:18:02 +0000 2015||RT @barbfederostrov: News!

|Millions of low-income children are failing to get the free preventive exams and screenings guaranteed by Medicaid and the Obama administration is not doing enough to fix the problem, . .. The report, released Thursday by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General (OIG), says the administration has boosted rates of participation but needs to do more to ensure that children get the regular wellness exams, dental checkups and vision and hearing tests. The report notes that 63 percent of children on Medicaid received at least one medical screening in 2013, up from 56 percent in 2006, but still far below the department’s 80 percent goal.. Only Iowa and California exceeded that standard last year. Alaska and Ohio were below 40 percent. Five more states — Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon and Wyoming — were between 40 percent and 45 percent.. Child health advocates cite several factors for the low rates, including a shortage of doctors treating Medicaid patients, states’ low pay for providers and parents’ lack of awareness about the importance of the visits.. Both children and taxpayers pay a steep price when children’s health problems are not caught early.. “We end up with kids who are sicker, with more long-term, serious medical issues that are more expensive to treat,” said Jennifer Clarke, executive director of Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia.. Some experts say that state officials — not the federal government— bear most of the responsibility for low screening rates because they administer Medicaid, the state-federal program for the poor. They say states need to step up oversight over the private Medicaid health plans that many contract with to cover children in the program.. “The federal government is working hard on this, but the only power they have over states is to take away their funding and that is highly unlikely,” said Jane Perkins, legal director of the National Health Law Program.. Congress introduced the Medicaid benefit, known as the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program, or EPSDT, in 1967 so that children would get . . About 32 million children on Medicaid were eligible for the benefit in 2013.. The preventive care program is more generous than those offered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or private health insurers because it guarantees coverage not just for a wide range of tests, but also the treatments to address health problems. Most states follow the . , which calls for 13 preventive visits in first three years of life followed by mostly annual visits until age 21.. Boston pediatrician Michael McManus, a member of the academy’s state government affairs committee, said he is saddened by the fact that more than a third of children on Medicaid are not getting at least one regular preventive exam. “We have a lot of work to do,” he said.. Low participation rates have plagued the program for years, according to previous reports by the inspector general’s office and . .. A . found that 76 percent of children in nine states did not receive all required medical, vision, and hearing screenings, 41 percent of children nationwide did not receive any of the screenings, and more than half did not receive any vision or hearing screenings. All states are required to provide the benefit.. The latest OIG report praised the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for working to increase screening rates, such as by distributing guides that enable states and providers to share their best ideas. The guides show, for instance, how some states used websites to educate providers and parents. Some states such as New York require Medicaid health plans to educate members about the benefit and what it covers. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island .  by offering gift certificates for pizza and movie tickets, according to a 2014 CMS report.. Still, the report said, “the underutilization of medical screenings is an ongoing concern.” CMS has done “very little” to encourage providers to complete all five components of an EPSDT medical screening—   physical exam, medical history, immunizations, lab test and education, the report said.. CMS had no immediate comment on the report.. Medical screening rates fall off dramatically as children get older, according to federal data that track states’ efforts. For example, about 90 percent of children below the age of 1 get at least one screening. But screening rates drop to 77 percent for kids between the ages of 1 and 2, and 56 percent for those between 10 and 14.. Ohio, which had the lowest rate of children getting regular exams in 2013, attributed its problems to the process of getting Medicaid managed care plans to report their data to the state.. Neva Kaye, interim executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, said data collection is an issue for some states but it doesn’t explain most of the low rates.  In addition to the shortage of doctors participating in Medicaid, parents often face transportation and language barriers getting children in for the exams, she said.. Dr. David Kelley, chief medical officer for Pennsylvania’s Medicaid program, said that state is working to boost the number of children getting checkups in part by paying bonuses to doctors to do them. He said that the rate of Pennsylvania kids getting the screenings is “in the middle of the pack” and “that is not good enough.”. Clarke, with the Public Interest Law Center, said low Medicaid reimbursement to pediatricians means fewer doctors are available to see poor children and parents face long delays getting their kids in for preventive visits and treatment, if they can get to see them at all.. The center .  on behalf of 2 million children in Medicaid saying low reimbursement for Medicaid pediatricians prevented children from getting the health services to which they are entitled. A judge is expected to rule later this month on the case.|Thu Nov 13 14:40:23 +0000 2014||RT @philgalewitz: Millions of kids on Medicaid failing to get preventive exams....See how your state measures up |5.3290582376134656e+17|http://bit.ly/1upI3Li

|While Ebola stokes public anxiety, more than one in six hospitals — including some top medical centers — are having trouble stamping out less exotic but sometimes deadly infections, federal records show.. Nationally, about one in every 25 hospitalized patients gets an infection, and .  from them—more than from car crashes and gun shots combined. A Kaiser Health News analysis found 695 hospitals with higher than expected rates for at least one of the six types of infections tracked by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In 13 states and the District of Columbia, a quarter or more of hospitals that the government evaluated were rated worse than national benchmarks the CDC set in at least one infection category, the KHN analysis found.. The missteps Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital made this month in handling an Ebola patient echo mistakes hospitals across the nation have made in dealing with homegrown infections. Dr. Kevin Kavanagh, a patient safety expert from Kentucky, said hospitals too often don’t strictly follow protocols to deal with infectious diseases, and the government’s standard responses are not specific enough. “Right now there are too many recommendations on how to handle infectious diseases, too much leeway,” he said.. A 2011 .  underscored the problem, observing that while hospitals have reduced the frequency of many infections over the last decade, they could do better if . . Those include always washing their hands and using maximal barrier procedures when tubes are being inserted, such as covering patients from head to toe with a sterile drape and wearing sterile caps, masks gowns and gloves.. “The percentage of time that health care providers do all of the things they are supposed to do when caring for a patient with a contagious disease can be pretty low,” said one of the authors, Dr. Don Goldmann, chief medical and science officer at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit in Cambridge, Mass. “There’s a lot of room for improvement.”. Goldmann said that hospitals tend to become more focused on following procedures when facing novel, highly publicized outbreaks such as Ebola. “When [an infection risk has] been around for a long time, it kind of becomes part of the background,” he said.. Since 2012 the federal government has been analyzing and publishing the CDC rates for specific hospitals on Medicare’s Hospital Compare website. Starting this fall, Medicare is considering infection rates when deciding . .. The CDC reports . : those from flexible tubes inserted into veins to deliver medicines or nutrients; infections from catheters that drain bladders; two antibiotic resistant germs, .  (C. diff) and Methicillin-resistant .  (MRSA); and two surgical site infections after hysterectomies and colon operations.. States with more than a quarter of hospitals having at least one high infection rate in the CDC data were Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Utah, according to the KHN analysis of the most current CDC records.. Three highly regarded institutions—New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pa., and the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor—were among seven hospitals the CDC rated as having worse rates for four of the six infections, KHN found.. The CDC data, based on reports hospitals submit, are considered the most reliable assessments that exist. Still, many hospitals the CDC judged as having worse rates disputed those verdicts. They said that they look bad because they are more vigilant in identifying and reporting infections, or because they handle very sick patients who are more prone to catching a bug.. For instance, Dr. Darrell Campbell Jr., chief medical officer at the University of Michigan Health System, said hysterectomies are performed on cancer patients at four times the rate than at other Michigan hospitals that compare information with each other. Because cancer surgeries take longer than regular hysterectomies, often involving removal of pelvic lymph nodes, the chances of infection are greater, he said.. “When you adjusted for the cancer, we don’t look different from any of the hospitals,” he said. Campbell said none of Michigan’s infection rates deserved being rated poorly.  “Eventually, we’ll get where we are more comfortable with this data, but we’re not there now,” he said.. New York-Presbyterian said in a statement it has made “significant improvements.” Geisinger said in a statement that its infection rates have dropped since 2012 and that its MRSA rate appeared high because the hospital made a “data entry error” when it reported cases to the government. Geisinger also noted that many patients who test positive for C. diff never develop any symptoms, but hospitals still must report it as an infection.. Some major teaching hospitals, like Denver Health Medical Center, Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C., and Mayo Clinic’s hospitals in Rochester, Minn., have been able to maintain low infection rates, the KHN analysis shows.. Others are succeeding in controlling some infection types but not others, according to the CDC data. Yale-New Haven Hospital had lower rates of bloodstream infections caused by central lines, but higher rates of infections from catheters inserted into the bladder to remove urine. Since one of the main ways to avoid such infections is to remove the catheter as soon as it is not essential, the hospital now allows nurses to take them out without a physician’s order under certain conditions, said Dr. John Boyce, the hospital’s director of epidemiology and infection control. “Busy physicians sometimes forget their patient has a catheter in, but the nurses know,” he said.. Nationally, surgical site .  by a fifth and central-line infections decreased by 44 percent between 2008 and 2012. MRSA decreased by a third during that period.. Battling .  than fighting Ebola and in some ways harder, because it requires hospitals to restrain use of the antibiotics necessary for so many patients. When those drugs eliminate weaker bacteria from the intestines, C. diff is able to prosper. Patients can get massive diarrhea and, while C. diff can be treated, the worse cases may require surgery to remove the infected part of the intestines.. Other infections for which the CDC tracks but does not yet publish hospital-specific rates, known as . , are impervious to nearly all antibiotics.. Reducing the frequency of C. diff and these kinds of infections requires hospitals to become more judicious in deploying antibiotics. But only about half of hospitals have established stewardship programs that help doctors use the appropriate antibiotics in the most effective doses without overdoing it, researchers say.. “We have increasing amounts of data that thirty to fifty percent of the antibiotics we are prescribing are inappropriate,” said Dr. Kavita Trivedi, a consultant and former infection control official for California. “It sounds crazy to people who are not in medicine: Why would a patient be prescribed an antibiotic they don’t need? But it happens frequently because we don’t know what they need.”|Tue Oct 21 21:49:03 +0000 2014||RT @jordanrau: See how many of your state's hospitals have high infection rates here  via @KHNews|5.246787790302331e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/October/21/hospital-infections-by-state.aspx

|The California Office of the Patient Advocate Wednesday released “report cards” that rate major health plans on selected clinical care services, including cancer treatment, mental health, chronic disease management and patient satisfaction.. The assessments, which also include data on selected medical groups, are available .  in multiple languages.. The state timed the release of this year’s report cards to coincide with the second round of open enrollment in Covered California, the state’s online health exchange, which kicks off Nov. 15. Several plans included in the report cards are offered on the exchange.. “Consumers can make more informed health care decisions,” said California Health and Human Services Agency Secretary Diana Dooley during a conference call with reporters. “I hope all Californians who are faced with competing health plan enrollment choices during the weeks ahead will find these report cards to be a helpful resource.”. This is the 14th year the agency has generated health care quality report cards. This year, the organization aggregated claims and electronic medical record data and patient satisfaction surveys for the state’s biggest insurance plans and more than 200 medical groups. In total, these organizations serve upward of 16 million Californians, officials said.. The report cards rate 10 health maintenance organizations, six preferred provider organizations and 200 medical groups on a four-star scale. All HMOS rated “good” or “excellent” on their ability to provide quality clinical services compared to national standards. Ratings from patients on their experience  were not as favorable. For instance,  all HMOs were rated “poor” in terms of “getting services easily’” with the exception of Kaiser Permanente. (Kaiser Health News is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.). All PPOs rated “good” or “fair” on the quality of clinical services. Only Aetna and Cigna received “poor” ratings in “getting services easily.”. The report cards are part of a larger national push to bring greater transparency to the health care industry and help consumers choose services that best fit their needs.. The California health care report cards are freely available to all consumers online and through mobile applications.. “The availability of data … allows us to create products that allow people to make better decisions in almost every circumstance,” said Bryan Sivak, the chief technology officer at the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services. And as a result, insurance companies “will have to compete on the things that matter to people.”. Experts say that while patient satisfaction measures may provide insights into bedside manner, they may not not provide reliable information on the quality of care.. The California health care ratings don’t include information on individual doctors. Instead, they provide a snapshot of a health plan’s or medical group’s strengths and weaknesses. More granular data on individual providers could be useful, experts say, especially if physician reviews of other physicians are incorporated.. “I would put ton of credibility on that,” said Scott Decker, president of health care transparency company HealthSparq, earlier this year.|Thu Oct 16 16:27:33 +0000 2014||RT @annagorman: Calif.

|Efforts to enroll Asian Americans in the health law’s marketplace plans have generally been touted as a success, but because coverage details are provided primarily in English or Spanish, those who depend on their native languages have encountered roadblocks as they try to use this new insurance.. About 35 percent of Asian Americans have limited English proficiency, according to a . from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.. The issue of language access gained attention last summer when the Obama administration notified thousands of people that their health insurance subsidies were at risk unless they updated their citizenship documentation because information on their initial applications could not be verified. Advocates said many of those in jeopardy did not speak English well and did not understand the paperwork they received.. This example is not an isolated one.. Asian Americans, with limited English who enrolled in plans with the help of bilingual navigators and in-person assisters, are now trying to understand a slew of documents – things like explanations of benefits packages or notifications about paperwork deadlines – that often are not translated.. Data measuring just how many enrollees have had trouble understanding their insurance material is hard to come by, said Jen Lee, director of community services and partnerships at the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. But it’s not uncommon, especially for Asian Americans who seek insurance through a federal or state exchange, she said. “It becomes a huge issue moving forward,” she said.. Last year, Asian Americans .  .  in plans at a rate higher than expected. Federal officials have reported that 5.5 percent of those who signed up for marketplace plans were Asian Americans, while they make up just .  of the population nationally.. The marketplace will “ask which language do you prefer – and for my clients that language is Korean. But they’re not receiving those notices in Korean,” said Minja Hong, program director at Korean Community Services, a New York-based assister agency.. In one case, she recalled, a Korean-speaking woman called the marketplace to find out why her plan was canceled. She came away from the call believing she had paperwork missing. When Hong followed up, it turned out the woman actually had never paid her premium.. This kind of language barrier could violate .  of the federal health law, said Priscilla Huang, policy director for the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum. That provision, modeled on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibits barring people from “any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving federal financial assistance, including credits, subsidies, or contracts of insurance” based on race, national origin, sex or ability.. Asian Americans – particularly those less comfortable with English – . . For that reason, not providing in-language resources can be construed as discrimination based on national origin, Huang said, and the reference to “contracts of insurance” extends that protection to include private plans being sold on the marketplace. But, she added, the Department of Health and Human Services has not yet issued regulations on how to enforce Section 1557 – making it difficult to interpret or enforce the provision in cases such as these.. Huang, whose organization is in a consortium that advocates on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders regarding health issues, said her group has been talking with HHS about having Section 1557 regulations issued before the next round of open enrollment, which starts Nov. 15. So far, though, there’s no timeline as to when that will happen.. “There are good intentions – however, we do want to see more action,” Huang said.. HHS will issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding 1557 in coming months, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.. People who believe they have faced discrimination “on one of the bases” the provision protects can file a complaint through the agency’s civil rights . . HHS has been investigating complaints it has received, CMS said.. Some civil rights complaints have .  by groups that advocate for immigrants, including an Asian American group in Pennsylvania, specifically addressing messages HHS sent out . . Those complaints assert that the notices didn’t take sufficient measures to warn customers in their native language that they could potentially lose their insurance.. Insurance plans do make an effort to reach consumers and help them use their new plans, said Susan Pisano, vice president of communications at American’s Health Insurance Plans, a lobbying group.. “When I talk to plans, they’re very focused on getting good information to new members – both about what their insurance options are and then also once enrolled, how to use their new benefits,” she said. “They’re paying particular attention to this where the issue of culture or the issue of language comes into play – but they understand that there’s still more work to do.”. Meanwhile, when consumers receive English-language packets, they usually return to the navigators who helped them enroll, Lee said. This fall, those navigators will be working to reach new customers while helping old ones re-enroll in their plans – so having to do translation work on top of that can strain already limited resources, she said.. “Our health centers – they are constantly working with folks who … are already enrolled and have questions,” she said.. Navigators and assisters across the board received less funding this year than last. In states with federally facilitated marketplaces, for instance, HHS awarded .  compared to 2013’s . – and many assister programs .  working either near or at capacity.. In theory, people looking for help translating their insurance papers can turn to hotlines or the marketplace, Hong said. But, Hong added, those conversations can actually be detrimental. About 85 percent of people she sees are limited in speaking or understanding English.. “It becomes a three-way conversation that is very unwieldy,” she said. “Often the translator is not familiar with the language of insurance, and things get lost in translation.”. If unchecked, Hong said, such language disconnects could discourage Asian Americans from enrolling in or maintaining health insurance. And if people can’t understand plans, Lee added, just having coverage isn’t enough.. “How are they supposed to … understand the next step in accessing care,” Lee said, “if the packets and tools in the marketplace aren’t – for limited English proficiency folks – navigable?”|Thu Oct 16 16:15:18 +0000 2014||Even With Insurance, Language Barriers Could Undermine Asian Americans Access To Care  |5.227828473889014e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/October/16/Even-With-Insurance-Language-Barriers-Could-Undermine-Asian-Americans-Access-To-Care.aspx

|Troy and Alana Pack had spent the day at their neighborhood Halloween party in Danville. Ten-year-old Troy went as a baseball player, and 7-year-old Alana was a good witch. In the afternoon, they changed out of their costumes and set out for a walk with their mother. Destination: Baskin Robbins 31 Flavors.. “Alana, she liked anything with chocolate,” says their father, Bob Pack. “Troy, for sure, bubble gum ice cream, ’cause he liked counting the bubble gums that he would get.”. Bob Pack stayed home. His family made it only half a mile down the road before his phone rang: “I received a call from a neighbor screaming there’d been an accident. And I raced down there.”. An impaired driver had veered off the road and hit Troy and Alana head-on. Pack was doing CPR on Troy when the paramedics arrived.. “I remember telling them I love them, and hang on. Just praying that they could hang on,” he says. Troy and Alana were pronounced dead at the hospital. In the months after their death, Pack’s wife, Carmen, retreated into her Catholic faith. Bob Pack was angry.. “I think, for me to get through, I needed action,” he says, “and I needed to take action for justice for Troy and Alana, and also for doing something that I thought maybe I could change to benefit others in the future.”. That was nearly 11 years ago. Pack quit his tech job to become an advocate. Over the last decade, he has helped write seven bills in California’s legislature. None of his efforts have been bigger than the one he’s working on for the November election: Proposition 46, the patient safety initiative. It’s complex and has three distinct proposals.. The first proposal, aimed at addressing “doctor shopping,” came about because investigators found the driver who killed his kids was abusing prescription narcotics.. “She had gone to numerous doctors, saying that she was under different pain — neck pain, back pain, leg pain, elbow pain,” Pack says. “They, in my view, recklessly wrote prescriptions for her, for thousands of pills.”. Pack set out to help the state build a database where doctors can see how many times a patient has been prescribed serious narcotics, like Vicodin or OxyContin. The result is the CURES database, or the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System.. Prop. 46 would make it mandatory for doctors to consult the database. California would become one of nine states requiring doctors to check before prescribing painkillers to first-time patients.. After passing similar laws, Tennessee and New York saw a significant reduction in the number of narcotics prescriptions written. Studies have verified the correlation, but acknowledge that drug abusers may be turning to street drugs, like heroin.. Many doctors in California like the database. Some have called it “indispensable.” But they don’t like being told how to practice medicine.. “The problem with the current way the ballot measure is written is it makes it mandatory, to have that database checked,” says Dr. Richard Thorp, president of the California Medical Association, adding technical glitches have made the database unreliable.. Doctors are also unhappy about another big piece of Prop. 46: the proposed change to the cap on “pain and suffering” awards in medical malpractice lawsuits.. After his kids died, Bob Pack wanted to sue the doctors who prescribed drugs to the driver.. “I set out and talked to about eight lawyers,” he says.. They all turned him down. They told him a 1975 state law limited the malpractice award he could get to $250,000. That meant puny attorneys’ fees. The case wouldn’t be worth the lawyers’ time.. “My reaction was ‘What?!’ That’s not democratic. That’s not America,” Pack says. “We all have the right to the court system.”. The law that set the cap is called MICRA, the . , passed with the intention of keeping medical liability insurance costs low. Several other states followed suit. California’s law caps only non-economic damages, or pain and suffering awards. Economic damages –- for medical expenses or lost wages –- are not capped.. But economic damages were no help for Pack. Children have no jobs, no lost wages. And his children, sadly, had no ongoing medical bills.. “So the victim gets victimized a second time,” Pack says, “they get no accountability or justice through the legal system.”. Some states have ruled such caps on pain and suffering awards unconstitutional.. Pack thinks California’s non-economic malpractice award should at least be adjusted for inflation. Prop. 46 would raise the cap from $250,000 to $1.1 million and provide an annual adjustment for inflation going forward.. But the CMA’s Richard Thorp sees a big problem. “That will encourage additional lawsuits in the system.” He argues more lawsuits will cause malpractice insurance premiums to go up, and those costs could drive doctors out of California.. “You’ll start to see it become more difficult to recruit doctors to California,” he says.. In a review of studies from the 1970s to the early 2000s, researchers writing for the Milbank Quarterly found that . , with study results ranging from 6 to 25 percent.. A proposal to require drug and alcohol testing for doctors has been the centerpiece of the “Yes on Prop. 46″ campaign, inspiring campy ads of airline pilots and police officers dancing through the stalls of a public restroom.. Adding doctors to that list seemed like an easy sell. Early polls indicated voters strongly favored the idea -– many thought it was already law. In fact, if Prop. 46 passes, California would be the first state in the country to require drug testing of doctors.. Prop. 46 would give the Medical Board of California a year to set up a system to test doctors for drug and alcohol use, both randomly and within 12 hours after an unexpected patient death or serious injury at the hospital.. Doctors groups say that goes too far.. “This approach is too heavy-handed and too inappropriate,” says CMA’s Thorp. He says hospitals already have systems in place to suspend doctors who show up to work intoxicated.. The two campaigns have fought back and forth over just how much of a problem there is with impaired doctors. Regardless, Prop. 46 author Pack says, not enough is being done.. “The medical board has no authority and no mandate to be able to find out who these guys are, and weed them out or get them help,” he says.. But the focus groups revealing voter support for the idea of doctor drug testing were convincing. That has opponents calling the provision nothing more than a political gimmick.. “The only reason that was added to the proposition is because it polled well with voters,” says Thorp. “They’re just hiding the fact that they’re trying to increase the cap on non-economic damages so that the payouts to trial attorneys can increase.”. Doctors and insurance companies have amassed $57 million to fight Prop. 46, making this the most expensive campaign of the fall election. They’re outspending lawyers 10 to 1 on ads aimed at swaying voters toward a no vote. None of them even mentions doctor drug testing.. Early polls showed strong support for the measure – 58 percent. But . , dropping to 34 percent support in mid-September. Twenty-nine percent of voters said they hadn’t yet decided.|Wed Oct 15 17:56:41 +0000 2014||California Prop. 46, Inspired By Tragedy, Pits Doctors Against Lawyers  |5.2244597302153626e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/October/14/California-Prop-46-Inspired-By-Tragedy-Pits-Doctors-Against-Lawyers.aspx

|We’re working on it.. No matter what the topic – from improving consumers’ experience with . , the health law’s Medicaid expansion, narrow networks and even Ebola — Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told reporters Thursday her agency is on it.. During a breakfast with reporters sponsored by Kaiser Health News and the health policy journal Health Affairs, Burwell tried to manage expectations about the health law’s next open enrollment season and declined to make a prediction about how many people would enroll this time around. She also cautioned that we are likely to see the number of Ebola cases rise before the crisis subsides.. A year ago Thursday, then Office of Management and Budget chief Burwell was in the .  caused by a battle with Republicans over .  for the very health care law she’s now charged with implementing.  Her success — or failure — over the next year in fixing problems with healthcare.gov and shaping public perception of the law may define its role in the 2016 presidential elections and well beyond.. The themes Burwell expressed during her question-and-answer session with reporters were familiar to those who have followed the secretary, who just passed her . . Expect improvement – but not perfection – when enrollment on healthcare.gov begins again Nov. 15. HHS officials are working with insurers, consumer groups, state officials and others to find out what’s right and what’s wrong with the website to make the user experience faster and simpler.. Ongoing testing of the site should mean it can handle increased traffic far better than the debacle of a year ago where numerous outages infuriated millions and gave the GOP even more fodder in their campaign to defund or repeal the entire law.  Work continues on the “back end” of the site, which deals with communications between the government and insurers.. Burwell took questions on a wide range of topics and her answers were careful and measured:. — When asked if she was taking a “back seat” on the administration’s response to the Ebola crisis, Burwell made it clear she’s on top of it — she’s often conducting three meetings a day on the issue. But she’s comfortable to let colleagues who are experts, . , chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, .  director of the National Institute of Health’s infectious disease institute, get more time at the microphone during press briefings.  Burwell didn’t mince words when it came to estimating the number of cases ahead.  “The numbers are going to increase before we get to a leveling off point,” she said. On Wednesday, the first person diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. .  and .  in West African countries.. — Burwell acknowledged that the data on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ .  “wasn’t perfect” but said HHS went forward with its release in an effort to improve government transparency.. — In response to a question about a recent .  that found some insurers were not properly ensuring that federal subsidies to help pay for health coverage were not being used to fund abortion, Burwell said that no federal funds were being spent on abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother, consistent with current law. She also said HHS is working with states and insurers to make sure they understand what the law requires. She added that the GAO report was based on last year’s plans – not those offered for 2015.. — HHS is working with governors who have yet to expand their Medicaid programs – a provision of the health care law the Supreme Court made optional for states – and to clear backlogs in other states where people who have signed up for Medicaid coverage have yet to receive it. She mentioned Indiana, Tennessee and Utah as states that she is in active discussions with about expansion. “We have to think about what flexibility they need and what is the best approach for their state,” she said.. — Burwell declined to give a target health law enrollment figure for 2015, pointing instead to a .  that exchange enrollment is projected to hit 13 million next year and climb to 25 million by 2017. “Now we actually have information about what happened in the first open enrollment period….We want to try and to build that number, bottom up, based on what we know [about] those who did enroll,” she said.|Fri Oct 10 14:39:37 +0000 2014||RT @charlesornstein: .@SecBurwell acknowledged that the data on @CMSGov #OpenPayments website wasnt perfect _campaign=KHN%3A+Daily+Health+Policy+Report&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=14451240&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9bwJUTEF8Bvd9rBn8imFz4mV63R1Tr0pm_mqkEsEzNVZC4-QV2wp3PLn_z8D1iruguG2Ljxc8VvMX05J0pX2zlmAPF5XaUNdzNBcO1T3btLhVe17w&_hsmi=14451240|5.205844400329482e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/10/burwell-meets-the-press-managing-expectations-on-ebola-healthcare-gov-aca-year-2/?utm

|Medicare evaluated the readmission rates of the nation’s hospitals in determining the third year of penalties in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. Medicare will apply the penalties to all its payments for patient stays between Oct. 1, 2014, and Sept. 30, 2015.. This chart lists states in the first column. That is followed by the percent of each state’s hospitals that were penalized. That includes hospitals exempted from the fines, such as those serving veterans and children. The next column shows the average penalty for penalized hospitals.

|Language and cultural issues, along with immigration concerns, could still pose major barriers to enrolling Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in health insurance plans this fall, according to a .  released Wednesday by Action for Health Justice, an advocacy coalition that aims to educate these populations about the health law.. The report argues that efforts to enroll people from those ethnic groups were undermined last year by ineffective translations of health law guides; limited language options on the federal online marketplace, healthcare.gov; insufficient training for enrollment assisters and complications in processing applicants’ immigration information. If those issues are not addressed by this year’s open enrollment – which begins Nov. 15 – they will likely continue to be a roadblock to expanding coverage, according to the report.. “Even with some of the advocacy efforts, both on the national level and also in the state-based marketplaces, I think some of the challenges will remain the same,” said Priscilla Huang, senior director of impact at the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum, one of the AHJ’s member associations..  .  indicate Asian-American enrollment was disproportionately high last year – 5.5 percent of people who enrolled in insurance plans were Asian-American, despite that group making up 5.1 percent of all uninsured people in 2012. But .  indicated much lower enrollment by Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. They made up 0.06 percent of enrollees in the federal marketplace, despite constituting 0.2 percent of all the uninsured. That study also noted the wide differences in uninsured rates among different Asian-American groups. For instance, in 2012, 7 percent of Japanese Americans did not have insurance, compared with 26 percent of Tongan Americans.. Call centers, online insurance applications and other documents all currently offer insufficient Asian-language services, according to the AHJ report. Phone operators at federal call centers spoke only Spanish or English, and online applications were also available only in those languages.. “If you don’t speak English or Spanish, only two out of four avenues are available,” Huang said. That is, consumers can find an in-person assister who speaks their language, or they can go through a call center and “hopefully getting connected to the right interpreter.”. And these difficulties are unlikely to change this year, she added.. The report also cited translation errors in documents intended to explain the law, which authors argued often limited consumers’ ability to navigate the insurance market. In some cases, the report notes, advocates working with AHJ chose not to distribute translated flyers because of language inaccuracies.. On healthcare.gov, instructions say services are available in 13 non-English languages, six of which are Asian. But the material available in each language varies. While some, such as Chinese and Vietnamese, have multiple explanatory documents and a print application, the only listed service for Hindi and Gujarati speakers is in-language assistance over the phone.. Additionally, AHJ concluded that federal training for in-person assisters – people designated to help consumers navigate enrollment – fell short, particularly in regard to helping people with complicated immigration statuses. About 60 percent of Asian-Americans and 14 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders were born outside of the United States, according to the report.. This isn’t the first time concerns have been raised about the training. .  published in July by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 92 percent of assister programs would have liked more training, with 39 percent of programs noting they would have particularly liked more training in dealing specifically with immigration status.. Enrollment will likely be more difficult this year, Huang said, noting that last year’s enrollment picked “the low-hanging fruit” in terms of accessible consumers. But the most successful enrollment for Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians involved in-person outreach, she said – and limited numbers of assisters means “a lot of capacity constraints as well.”. Legally residing immigrants also often faced difficulties verifying their immigration status or indicating their correct income when applying for insurance — challenges that in many cases jeopardized or stalled enrollment, according to the report.. , the Obama administration announced that more than 100,000 legal residents could lose insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act because missing paperwork meant they hadn’t properly verified their immigration status, while more than 300,000 could lose subsidies for their insurance because they had not correctly indicated their income.. Although technology is expected to improve this year, “we’re very concerned that may happen again this year,” Huang said.. “The consumers did their parts in terms of submitting documents or mailing them in,” she said. “And due to website glitches or other things – that were not in the hands of the consumer but really the responsibility of the states and [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] – they’re now facing termination of their coverage.”|Wed Sep 24 15:51:11 +0000 2014||Difficulties Likely To Persist In Enrolling Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders |5.148042446844805e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/09/report-difficulties-likely-to-persist-in-enrolling-asian-americans-pacific-islanders-native-hawaiians/
|LONDON, KY.  — David Combs has been a health insurance broker in this small city in central Kentucky for more than 15 years.  When the Affordable Care Act became law, he read it cover to cover. Then he “panicked” and sold his agency.. The mainstay of his business had been selling coverage to small companies. And here was the government, stepping in and offering to sell it online instead. Initially, Combs and his fellow brokers thought they would go the way of travel agents, no longer needed in a do-it-yourself online marketplace.  . But he started to think about the law in a new way after he learned that brokers could still earn a commission for selling coverage through the exchange. Kentucky built its own health insurance exchange – called Kynect — and to expand Medicaid. . “I knew there was going to be a massive change in our industry, and anytime there’s a massive change, there’s opportunity,” says Combs, who started a new agency in 2013.  . Some of the states that were most successful in enrolling consumers on the exchanges embraced brokers. In California, 39 percent of people who signed up for a private exchange plan enrolled with a broker; in Kentucky the number reached 44 percent.  . Combs’ key insight was that many of his small business clients could do better dropping their small group coverage and helping their workers sign up for individual insurance on the exchange. The law allows companies with fewer than 50 full-time workers not to offer insurance.  .  . Frisch’s Big Boy, a bustling franchise diner off the highway, is the kind of small business client for Combs. Until this year, their policy was only available to full-time workers, and it was expensive, costing the company and the workers each $150 a month. Few of those eligible at Frisch’s actually bought policies. And on top of that, they were facing an 86 percent rate increase in 2014. . “It didn’t make sense for [Frisch’s] to continue to offer health insurance,” explains Combs. “It was actually a detriment to their employees.” . Because most of the restaurant’s employees are low-income, they actually qualified for free or low-cost coverage on Kynect. Switching everybody over to the exchange was win-win-win: cheaper for the restaurant, cheaper for the employees and more people got coverage, including some part-time workers.  . “I thought to some degree it was too good to be true, what people were paying,” says Frisch’s part-owner Herman Hatfield. “But it worked out to where a lot of people got better care for less money.”   . Combs earns a commission of $20 per month for each person he enrolls, including spouses and children. That commission is paid by the insurer and is already built into premiums. He was able to enroll everyone at Frisch’s in just two days. . Enrolling one person by phone, Combs says, might take several hours. But because he is able to tell everyone at a certain business what to bring in advance, such as a pay stub and their Social Security number, he’s able to sign an individual up in just 15 minutes and a family in 30 minutes. . Virtually all of the small businesses Combs had sold coverage to in the past were eligible to make a transition similar to Frisch’s. “We’re running into an industry as many of our fellow brokers are running out, because they’re trying to do [sell policies] on a onesie-onesie basis, and you’ll go broke,” he explains.  . Waitress Mary Gray is one of only 12 people at Frisch’s who used to buy the company’s old insurance policy. She ended up enrolling in a silver plan that was completely subsidized: She pays nothing toward her premium. She is one of the 28 employees at Frisch’s who Combs has enrolled in a private Kynect plan – most of the rest of Frisch’s 60 full and part-time employees qualified for Medicaid, while a few had employer-sponsored coverage through a spouse or parent. . Prior to the health law, Combs says a successful agent might have signed up 14 new small business groups in a year; since Obamacare went live in October, he’s been enrolling that many in a month.  . He’s been endorsed by the Kentucky Restaurant Association and holds seminars throughout the state. .  . But brokers’ roles are not so significant everywhere. Kentucky’s statistic of 44 percent of consumers who bought private plans through brokers compares to just 8 percent nationwide, according to .  from the Kaiser Family Foundation.  (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) . In . , brokers fought against the health law, and against navigators, workers paid with government funds who help people sign up for Obamacare.  But in Kentucky, exchange director Carrie Banahan set up a special committee for brokers and navigators and got them talking.  . “We’ve had a great relationship with the agent community in Kentucky,” says Banahan. “It was contentious at first. But once they got to know each other, they built a level of trust and they get along very well.”  . The two categories of insurance workers essentially divided the labor in Kentucky. The navigators mainly signed up the poorest people in the state for free Medicaid coverage. The brokers concentrated on those eligible for private exchange coverage, where they could earn a commission.    . In addition, Kynect solicited broker advice on making policy decisions and designing the online marketplace, which includes a “Find a broker” feature that helps connect a consumer with a local agent. Upon request, Kynect also created a special help line for brokers to call in with questions. . And in addition to enrolling 35,000 people in private Kynect plans, brokers also enrolled another 20,000 in Medicaid, pro bono.  . Combs says that if brokers want to survive, they have to embrace the ACA, even if they don’t like it. “The ones that don’t want to get into it and educate themselves about health reform, I think they are going to become kind of a dinosaur fairly soon,” he says. . But those who can evolve have a huge opportunity. By December 2014, Combs expects his new agency to hit a million dollars in revenue, the most health insurance business he’s done in his 15 years as a broker in Kentucky. |Wed Sep 24 14:45:57 +0000 2014||Insurance Brokers Key To Kentucky's Obamacare Success |5.1478783002412646e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/September/24/Insurance-Brokers-Key-To-Kentuckys-Obamacare-Success.aspx
|Neglected to pick up your prescription? Now, there’s a good chance your doctor will know and do something about it, thanks to a slew of new partnerships between CVS Health and various health systems.. One of the most recent, which is slated to begin by early next year, will integrate the electronic medical records from MedStar Health’s 10 hospitals and 4,000 doctors – located in Washington, D.C. and Maryland — with CVS pharmacies as well as the chain’s 900 Minute Clinics located across the country. . It makes coordination easier, said Bob Gilbert, MedStar’s president of ambulatory services. . When someone gets care at a pharmacy or retail clinic, it will be entered in the patient’s MedStar records for the doctor to see. Nurse practitioners at a CVS clinic will get to see relevant health information within a patient’s electronic record, though pharmacists will not.. Counting the MedStar partnership, CVS now has 41 such health-system agreements in place, with the last nine encompassing the retailers’ pharmacies. CVS hopes the other existing arrangements – which linked the systems with the Minute Clinics — will follow this course. . The move underscores .  by retail pharmacies to expand their role in the health care market. CVS has the most physician partnerships, but competitor Walgreens is also associated with 20 health systems and has joined accountable care organizations – the care-giving coalitions created by the health law to control costs. Even stores like Wal-Mart and grocery companies such as Safeway, which features some in-store pharmacies, are looking to bolster ties with clinics and hospitals.. “There aren’t enough primary care physicians to treat enough chronic and routine care that patients need. Ergo, the market is responding,” said Christopher Kerns, managing director for research and insights at the Advisory Board Company, a health care consulting firm. . CVS – which itself operates .  – now has relationships with between 300 and 350 hospitals in addition to clinics and physician groups, according to spokeswoman Christine Cramer, adding that the exact number is hard to quantify. These collaborations extend over 24 states plus the District of Columbia. . The agreements do not have any explicit financial element. “It’s purely a clinical collaboration,” said MedStar spokeswoman Ann Nichols.. But health system partnerships can still benefit a pharmacy company like CVS. . “When it comes to chronically ill patients, there’s now incentive [for physicians] to refer them to CVS” for day-to-day disease management, Kerns said. That can give a company a new stream of customers  and drive up pharmacy sales and in-store foot traffic. . Entering such partnerships can make sense for a hospital system, too. For instance, if different providers communicate well, they help reduce how often the chronically ill need to go to the hospital. . “It’s a way of being able to provide more care to more people, more conveniently and ideally at a lower cost,” Kearns added. . By reducing admissions and readmissions, for instance, hospitals can address one of their major budget challenges. In addition to paying for patient care itself – which can be costly if those patients have lower incomes and are uninsured – hospitals with high readmission rates can face financial penalties from the government through reductions in Medicare payments — .  of each Medicare payment per patient for an entire year starting in October. Across all penalized hospitals in the country, those reductions are expected to total around $330 million annually.. Retail clinics say they offer routine health services in a cheaper and more convenient setting than doctors’ offices, urgent care or emergency facilities. In ads, CVS boasts that the clinics are open seven days a week, with nurse practitioners giving physicals, vaccines, strep tests and other basic services. Most services cost less than $100. Clinics are often separated from pharmacies by a privacy screen.. “It really goes back to today’s health care consumers looking for care when they want it,” Gilbert said. . Much of the arrangement might remain invisible for a MedStar patient, said Patrick Gilligan, CVS’ senior vice president for system alliances.. But even if patients don’t see it directly, a stronger network between physicians, pharmacists and retail clinics is valuable, said Christine Alexander, 66, a MedStar patient who frequently gets basic health services and medication from her local Minute Clinic and CVS in Washington, D.C.. About 10 years ago, she said, health problems meant she had to take multiple kinds of medication, but “there wasn’t good communication, and I ended up taking way too many drugs that were interacting with each other.”. For patients with chronic conditions, “long term adherence is a big issue,” Gilligan.. But with this type of arrangement, pharmacists and nurse practitioners can more easily share information with doctors, providers can work in concert to encourage patients to stay on medication, Gilligan added.  “You tend to have a lot higher compliance rate,” Gilbert said.. In addition, because pharmacists see a patient’s entire drug regimen, they often notice the potential for drug interactions and other risks. When records are integrated, that information can more easily be transmitted to doctors, too. . “A lack of adherence and a problem of mixing the wrong medications is one of the leading causes of adverse events – it’s one of the leading causes of readmissions,” Kerns said.|Wed Sep 24 14:28:46 +0000 2014||Win-Win?

|The number of health insurance companies offering plans in the marketplaces this fall will increase by 25 percent, giving consumers more choices for coverage, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced Tuesday.. When the marketplace enrollment reopens in November, 77 new insurers will be offering coverage in the 44 states for which HHS had data, which includes the 36 states that use the federal marketplace and eight states that run their own, the department . .. The number of competitors on the marketplaces is considered important because it signifies the vitality of the exchange and can mean increased competition and lower prices for consumers. It also means that insurers see the health law’s online marketplaces or exchanges, as a good business opportunity, senior HHS officials said.. Nine insurers that offered coverage in the federal marketplaces and four that offered plans in the state exchanges for 2014 won’t do so again in 2015, but most of those insurers’ parent companies will be active in the respective states’ exchanges, according to the report.. In her remarks at the Brookings Institution Tuesday, Burwell said, her first priority “is improving access and affordability through the marketplace. In order to make sure that Americans continue to access affordable choices, we have to get HealthCare.gov right.” .  botched last year’s open enrollment. . According to the HHS figures, in 2014, 191 issuers offered plans in the 36 states using the federal marketplace. Preliminary reports indicated that 249 issuers will be in those states on the federal marketplace in the 2015 enrollment season, which begins Nov. 15. In the eight state exchanges, 67 insurers will offer plans, compared to 61 in 2014. . Senior HHS officials could not elaborate on what “tiers” of coverage the new entrants would offer or how much that coverage would cost. The report also does not say in which counties the insurers will offer coverage, a factor that would directly influence the level of competition in coverage and price. Typically, most insurers don’t serve every county in states they operate in.. Burwell sought to cast the increase as one of a number of recent announcements suggesting that the 2010 health law has been successful in improving health care options for Americans.  She pointed to figures announced last week that 7.3 million people who signed up for the exchanges and paid their premiums, findings that HHS released Monday that 8 million people enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program since the beginning of open enrollment last year, and a 26 percent reduction of uninsured adults. . “I think we need a bit of a course correction in this country when it comes to how we talk about these issues — and it starts with collectively turning down the volume a bit,” she said. “Surely, we’d all agree that the back-and-forth hasn’t been particularly helpful to anyone — least of all the hardworking families who we all want to help.”. She also said that backers of the law “haven’t done a very good job of explaining why middle-class families who already had insurance are better off.” Families are paying less for coverage, Burwell said, and they benefit from knowing they “no longer have to worry about losing their homes or having their hard-earned savings wiped-out by an accident, or unexpected diagnosis.”|Wed Sep 24 14:21:46 +0000 2014||HHS: Number of marketplace insurers to rise 25 percent ,|5.1478174280975155e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/September/23/Number-Of-Marketplace-Insurers-To-Rise-25-Percent-HHS-Says.aspx

|About a quarter of the 243 groups of hospitals and doctors that banded together as accountable care organizations under the Affordable Care Act saved Medicare enough money to earn bonuses, . Tuesday.. Those 64 ACOs earned a combined $445 million in bonuses, the agency said. Medicare saved $372 million after accounting for the ACOs that did not show success, including four that overspent significantly and now owe the government money.. The bonuses, losses and Medicare savings are teensy sums in the context of a program that spends half a trillion dollars a year on care for the elderly and disabled. But the Obama administration views the results so far as evidence that reorganizing the financial incentives for doctors and hospitals — a key element of the health law — can translate to substantial savings if the program expands nationwide.. in which doctors and hospitals join together to coordinate care with the lure of earning extra money if they save Medicare money while maintaining the health of their patients. The program aims to encourage doctors to focus on keeping patients healthy and to intervene quickly if they are struggling, rather than waiting until they need complex — and for doctors in the old pay model, lucrative — operations or other kinds of care.. There are now more than . , although some of these ACOs are new enough that Medicare is not assessing their performance.. There are two types of ACO programs for which Medicare reported results. Under the largest experiment, the Medicare Shared Savings Program, 53 ACOs saved enough money for Medicare in 2013 to earn a piece of that as a bonus. On the red side of the ledger, 41 ACOs spent more than Medicare estimated they would under normal conditions. Most of these ACOs are shielded from financial penalties, but one –Dean Clinic and St. Mary’s Hospital Accountable Care Organization in Wisconsin –will have to repay Medicare $4 million because it cost Medicare $10 million above expectations.. A list of bonuses for those ACOs is available . For the remainder of these ACOs, Medicare either did not have final results or found spending changes so small that they might be due to fluctuations in patients’ year-to-year needs. Those ACOs received neither bonuses nor penalties.. The second, smaller group of 23 ACOs are in the Pioneer ACO Model. They have more experience, and the financial incentives are larger. Out of this group, . , Medicare announced. Three other ACOs in this Pioneer ACO Model lost money, and three more took advantage of a Medicare option that allows them to delay evaluation until after they have three years of experience..

|Reduced costs for medical services and labor have trimmed the 10-year projected cost of Medicare and Medicaid by $89 billion, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.. Medicare spending is projected to drop by $49 billion — or less than 1 percent — from 2015 and 2024, while Medicaid spending is expected to drop by $40 billion — or about 1 percent — over the next decade, CBO said in an .  to its . .. Despite the long-term projected drop, federal spending for major health care programs will jump this year by $67 billion — or about 9 percent —  the agency estimated.  The largest increase will be for Medicaid, which is projected to grow by $40 billion, or 15 percent. Most of this short-term increase is attributable to the Affordable Care Act, including its Medicaid expansion and the financial assistance to help people purchase health insurance.. More than half of the states and the District of Columbia .  for the health law’s Medicaid expansion. Subsidies to help eligible individuals purchase health on the law’s online marketplaces, or exchanges, and related expenses (mostly grants to states to establish exchanges) would total $17 billion this year, according to CBO.. CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation’s projections of outlays and revenues arising from the health law’s provisions related to health insurance coverage have not changed substantially since the spring for 2014 or over the 2015–2024 period, according to CBO.. CBO also said it expects Medicare outlays to increase this year by about $12 billion — or 2 percent — which is similar to the rate of growth in 2013 and below the growth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries.. A . ” remains a relative bargain compared to the 2012 estimate from CBO. Holding Medicare physician payment increases to the current rate through 2024 would cost $131 billion, CBO found.  For years, lawmakers have struggled to replace the current Medicare physician payment formula, known as the sustainable growth rate or SGR, and have repeatedly passed legislation to avoid heavy scheduled cuts.. While the price of an SGR replacement has dropped in recent years — CBO estimated the 10-year cost at $316 billion in 2012 — and there’s bipartisan support to replace the formula, Congress has yet to agree on how to pay for a replacement. Many policy analysts and lawmakers have recommended that Medicare physician payments be based on the quality of care provided, rather than the volume of services.|Wed Aug 27 22:44:49 +0000 2014||RT @maryagnescarey: My latest: CBO Projects Lower Medicare and Medicaid Costs  Capsules - The KHN Blog  via @khnews|5.047614784410788e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/08/cbo-projects-lower-medicare-and-medicaid-costs/

Evans is the director of the Center for Health Care Services, the community mental health system in San Antonio and  Bexar County..  ranks 49.  out of 50 states in how much funding it commits to mental health.  But under Evans’ leadership, Bexar County has built a mental health system considered a model for other cities across the country — one that has saved $50 million over the past five  years.. “In my entire career I’ve always understood the people who are the least valued, the people who society thinks the least of, are the people who have the most potential,” says Evans. “You reach out to them, they’ll do amazing things and nobody expects them to.”. Evans came to Texas in 1972 as a social worker, to help set up some of the very first community mental health systems, and he’s been in the state ever since. When he took over the Bexar county system 14 years ago, the county jail was so overcrowded — packed with people in various states of psychoses — that the state was getting ready to levy fines.. That’s not unusual. Across the country, about .  of inmates and prisoners have a serious mental illness that includes psychosis, according to a study from the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.. Evans’ idea for reform was simple: for people with mental illness, treatment works. And jail does not.. “Even here in Texas, which is very conservative, we learned some time ago that nonviolent mentally ill offenders shouldn’t be in prison. They don’t make good prisoners, ” he says, In a state of psychosis, a prisoner is hearing voices and can’t follow rules, and that means he gets no time off for good behavior, Evans explains.  “They take up space for violent offenders.”. It’s also an expensive revolving door. When people with a serious mental illness are released from jail, many end up living on the street, sick and often addicted. And then almost invariably, they end up back in jail for a minor nuisance crime, like panhandling (which is illegal in San Antonio), urinating in public, digging in dumpsters or sleeping on someone’s porch.. That all sounds very familiar to Samuel Lott. For decades, he was a white collar worker,  most recently for the BNSF railway in Fort Worth. But in 2006, he lost his job.. “Whatever diagnosis I had – depression, alcoholism, that sort of thing kicked into high gear back then, and I spiraled down pretty quick and became homeless,” says Lott.. For four years, Lott lived on the streets and camped in the woods. He was estranged from his family, got infected with hepatitis C, and his untreated depression started to take on signs of psychosis.  He had frequent run-ins with the police.. On his laptop, Lott, 51 pulls a picture of himself from 2010, the last time he was in jail. “This person is angry, unhealthy, there’s malnutrition, there’s no direction. You can see from the sunken cheekbones,” he says, pointing to the screen.. Getting treatment for any of his health problems felt hopeless, especially without transportation. “It meant having to walk from one side of town– I mean, miles and miles to the other side of town — maybe to get a referral, and then you take your referral and walk clear back over to some other side of town, and then maybe you can go and get the help,” Lott explains.. In addition to scattered services,  Leon Evans says there was another problem for this population: none of the county or city agencies and nonprofits that deal with people with serious mental illness was talking to one another. The jails, hospitals, courts, police and mental health department all worked in separate silos.. “People who fund these services only look at their little small piece of the pie and whether there is a return on investment,” says Evans.. So with the help of the county judge, Evans worked to get the funders together to talk about the money they were all spending on mental health.  It turned out to be the most challenging – and the most important – piece of the puzzle.. “If you think law enforcement and mental health workers have anything in common, we don’t, except people with substance abuse and mental health problems. We speak a different language, we have different goals, there’s not a lot of trust there,” he says.. So he hired Gilbert Gonzalez to take a look at the money that they were all spending on mental health.. “You know Brad Pitt in the movie Moneyball?” asks Gonzalez. “Well, the success in that movie was based on the data and analytics. We needed to do the same thing.”. Once they stopped looking at mental health as an isolated expense in the city budget, the players realized they were spending enormous sums of money to take care of people. And they were doing a bad job of it.   Pooling their resources instead, Gonzalez found, would offer significant savings.. The courts, the jails, the hospitals, the county government and the police department agreed to work together on the issue. Everyone provided funding– the police even contributed their drug seizure money – to build a system where people with mental illnesses could get better.. The result is one centralized complex which offers many services. The Restoration Center is conveniently located across the street from San Antonio’s state-of-the-art homeless shelter.. “One thing that’s really important about the San Antonio approach is that they’ve integrated services together for mental health and substance abuse and homeless services,  because most people have overlapping needs,” says Laura Usher, a program manager at the National Alliance on Mental Illness who helps set up collaborations between law enforcement agencies and mental health departments.. The center has a 48-hour inpatient psychiatric unit, sobering and detox centers, outpatient primary care and psychiatric services, a 90-day recovery program, housing for people with mental illnesses, and even job training and a program to help people transition to supported housing.. “San Antonio realized that it’s more cost effective to provide mental health services and supports to people on the front end, rather than pay for jail beds and prison time,” says Usher.. More than 18,000 people pass through the Restoration Center each year and officials say the coordinated approach is saving the city more than $10 million each year. “There’s no wrong door,” says Evans. Some patients walk in off the streets or with their families. Others are brought in by police or diverted here from programs inside the jails.. “San Antonio is ahead of what’s a growing trend across the country to try to build a non-hospital alternative for people who are experiencing a psychiatric emergency, often with co-occurring alcohol or other drug abuse,” says Dr. Mark Munetz, a psychiatrist and professor at Northeast Ohio Medical University who toured the Restoration Center last year.. But he says the San Antonio model might not work for everyone.  The Restoration Center and homeless shelter, he says, felt like “a psychiatric oasis, removing the people from the most central part of the city, it felt a little like segregating people in that part of the city, especially with the homeless shelter next door. I’m not sure how that would fly in other parts of the country.”. Nonetheless, the rest of the country has started to notice. Every state in the country has sent delegates to San Antonio to see if they can model their own mental health systems after this one.. Samuel Lott found his way there in  2010. He walked over to the Restoration Center from his jail cell a block away.  He went through the detox program, then a 90-day in-patient recovery program, followed by treatment for hepatitis C, and finally medication to help control his mental illness.  The center helped place him in an apartment of his own and provided him with additional job training.. He pulls up another photo on his laptop, this one taken Thanksgiving of 2012, two years after he arrived at the center. It’s a picture of Lott with his arms around his family – mother, father, brother, niece and nephew. He looks like a different man.. “I’ll start crying if I talk about it,” says Lott, who is now healthy and employed at the center. “It felt so good to be home, with my mother and my dad. And I had expected them to be angry and hurt, but it was the exact opposite. They were so happy for a member of the family to come home. Now I email with them every single day, text, Facebook, make plans for gatherings.”. He says he’s helping other people find the kind of hope and healing that he has.|Wed Aug 20 16:07:37 +0000 2014||RT @dwebbKHN: How did San Antonio find all that $$$ for mental health &amp; housing?

|As more Americans gain insurance under the federal health law, hospitals are rethinking their charity programs, with some scaling back help for those who could have signed up for coverage but didn’t.. The move is prompted by concerns that offering free or discounted care to low-income uninsured patients might dissuade them from getting government-subsidized coverage.. If a patient is eligible to purchase subsidized coverage through the law’s online marketplaces  but doesn’t sign up, should hospitals “provide charity care on the same level of generosity as they were previously?” asks Peter Cunningham, a health policy expert at Virginia Commonwealth University.. Most hospitals are still wrestling with that question, but a few have gone ahead and changed their programs, Cunningham says. . The online charity care policy at Southern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua, for example, now states that “applicants who refuse to purchase federally-mandated health insurance when they are eligible to do so will not be awarded charitable care.” . The same rule disqualifies aid to those who refuse to apply for expanded Medicaid, which New Hampshire lawmakers voted to extend, beginning Aug. 15.. At BJC HealthCare, which has 12 hospitals in Illinois and Missouri, including Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, anyone receiving financial assistance must make some contribution to their care, for instance, $100 for emergency care.  BJC does not bar financial aid to those who have refused to buy insurance through the health care law. . While all uninsured patients get a 25 percent discount off list charges, BJC gives additional discounts to those earning up to three times the federal poverty level, or about $35,000 for an individual.  Formerly, those additional discounts were available for those earning up to four times the poverty level, or about $46,600. . “Patients will continue to receive needed medical care regardless of their ability to make payment at the time of service,” says spokeswoman Kim Kitson, adding the changes are likely to affect fewer than 3 percent of patients. . To be sure, hospitals have a strong financial interest in having more patients covered by insurance. That’s particularly true for hospitals that see many uninsured patients because the health law also reduces their government payments for uncompensated care. The assumption was that most uninsured people would gain coverage and no longer run up large hospital bills that could not be paid.  But since the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the health law’s Medicaid expansion, 24 states decided not to participate. Hospitals that treat large numbers of low-income people in those states face real financial pressures.. In addition, the health law requires nonprofit hospitals to make their written charity policies widely available, although it does not specify what criteria hospitals use to determine who is eligible. The assistance programs aren’t just for the uninsured: Most hospitals also help insured patients struggling to pay deductibles or other costs associated with their care.. “Even those with health insurance are ‘uninsured’ for an increasing percentage of the medical care they need” because many have high annual deductibles, said Steven Lipstein, president and CEO of BJC HealthCare, in an opinion piece published in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.. Still, as the health law changes the insurance marketplace, “we are seeing charity care reductions,” says Michael Miller, director of strategic policy at Community Catalyst, an advocacy group in Massachusetts.. While Miller says the health law will result in more people with insurance, the need for financial assistance programs remains. He disagrees that charity programs would dissuade uninsured consumers from enrolling in coverage since most will need other health services besides hospital care.. “It’s really premature for hospitals to start presuming that level of calculation on the part of someone who shows up uninsured,” Miller says. . Hospital executives say they are weighing many questions in evaluating whether to change their policies.  Did people choose not to enroll – or were they unable to get through the new health insurance marketplaces during the open enrollment in the fall and spring? Did they know subsidized coverage is available? Could they afford insurance, even with a subsidy, given that many insurance plans have deductibles that can run into thousands of dollars annually?. “That’s something hospitals have struggled with for decades: Is the patient unwilling to pay or unable to pay?” says Katherine Arbuckle, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Ascension Health.. At Ascension, one of the nation’s largest not-for-profit hospital groups based in St. Louis, Mo., a special task force will make recommendations before the end of the year on whether changes are needed. . “How do you treat those who decline [coverage]? Do they get free services when others have paid?” asks Arbuckle. . While nothing has been finalized, Arbuckle says the Catholic hospital chain has ruled out some changes, saying it will not reduce the income threshold for those who qualify for free care, currently at twice the federal poverty rate. That’s about $23,340 for an individual.. Many hospitals are simply checking to see if their policies comply with the health law’s requirements, says Todd Nelson, a director at the Healthcare Financial Management Association, which represents more than 40,000 people who work in health care finance.. He is not surprised that some require applicants to apply for insurance coverage.. “Hospitals have always encouraged patients to apply for coverage they are entitled to receive, whether commercial insurance through employer or through programs like Medicaid,” he says.. Several hospital chains, including two of the largest — Tenet and HCA — say they don’t have plans to change their charity care policies. Both offer free care to those who meet certain requirements, including earning less than twice the federal poverty rate.. While many charity care programs have been in place for decades, others were established following widespread complaints and lawsuits brought in the late 1990s over aggressive hospital collections tactics.  Those included placing liens on patients’ homes and charging the uninsured the highest list prices, which were far more than what insurance companies paid on behalf of policyholders.. Now, under the health law, nonprofit hospitals must make reasonable efforts to determine if patients qualify for help before taking tough collection tactics. And the law says the amount sought from the patient cannot be the hospitals’ list price, but an amount closer to what is generally billed to insured patients.. The big benefit from the health law is that it requires hospitals to make their charity policies public, says Mark Rukavina, an expert on medical debt who consults for hospitals.. “The ACA’s requirements will improve transparency dramatically,” he says.|Tue Aug 19 20:21:52 +0000 2014||RT @raksingh: ICYMI Hospitals Reconsider Charity For Patients Who Decline Health Coverage via @Julie_appleby  _campaign=KFF%253A+The+Latest&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ow0wDBDzPO4BYccrRc6uWJPPlJYWU062tRRSTaagZ-fA6VBHyNoeqR--3e9im_hdegTppxA6U0e0x0rJf4FUx6jh-aw&_hsmi=13845822 via @k|5.01826404489515e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/August/18/Hospitals-Reconsider-Charity-For-Patients-Who-Decline-Health-Coverage.aspx?utm

|CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — The dominion of Tennessee’s largest health insurer is reflected in its headquarters’ lofty perch above the city, atop a hill that during the Civil War was lined with Union cannons to repel Confederate troops.. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee has used its position to establish a similarly firm foothold in the first year of the marketplaces created by the health law. The company sold 88 percent of the plans for Tennessee individuals and families. Only one other insurer, Cigna, bothered to offer policies in Chattanooga, and the premiums were substantially higher than those offered by BlueCross.. Though insurers have been regularly vilified in debates over health care prices, BlueCross’ near monopoly here has been unusually good financially for consumers. Its cut-rate exclusive deal with one of three area health systems turned Chattanooga into one of the .  in the country, as judged by the lowest price mid-level, or silver, plan. The premium for a 40-year-old for that plan is $181 a month, 30 percent less than for the median cheapest silver plan nationally.. BlueCross has employed a similar narrow-network strategy elsewhere in Tennessee. Its lowest premium silver plan in Knoxville, built around the University of Tennessee Medical Center, costs the same as in Chattanooga. BlueCross’s .  is cheaper than the cheapest parallel plan in the biggest city in every state except Minnesota and Hawaii.. “Providers are concerned about getting shut out of narrow networks,” said John Graves, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.. Premiums are not low in Chattanooga because people do not require much medical care. Obesity, smoking and hypertension are more prevalent in Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is located, than they are nationwide, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a Seattle-based research center. Yet insurance prices are in line with some of the nation’s healthiest places: Minneapolis, Salt Lake City and Honolulu.. Chattanooga’s lowest cost silver plan gives people access to Erlanger Health System, a public authority with a network of hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee’s College of Medicine. In exchange for lower premiums, consumers choosing the narrow network, labeled the “E” network, have access to 1,257 doctors and medical providers who work with Erlanger, according to the latest figures from BlueCross.. David Yoder, CEO of American Exchange, a Chattanooga insurance brokerage, said the average client on that network has premiums of about $40 a month, with the government subsidizing the rest. “For most people, unless they are really tied to a doctor, the E network is fine,” he said.. BlueCross offers another set of policies that include both Erlanger and the Catholic Health Initiatives, which runs Memorial Hospital, for 11 percent more than the Erlanger-only network, which still puts the costs well below the national median. That wider network has 3,502 providers—nearly three times the number in the Erlanger-only network.. Eric Logue, a vice president for the Denver-based Catholic system who oversees the region, said low premiums in Chattanooga and Tennessee more generally were made easier by the long history of narrow networks here.. Logue said some insurers elsewhere “just come and say, ‘For our exchange product we’re going to roll out the same network.’ They’re not taking an approach to change the cost curve, and expectedly you’re seeing the premiums being extremely high.”. Those who want the option of also going to the area’s third health system, run by the for-profit company  HCA and including Parkridge Medical Center, can buy a wide-network policy, but premiums are 30 percent higher than for the Erlanger-only policy. HCA officials declined to comment.. It remains to be seen whether BlueCross will sustain its premium rates in coming years, or if the first years’ low prices were to grab most of the market. BlueCross says that is not the case. Andy Figlestahler, a broker in Cleveland, Tenn., noted that premiums in neighboring Georgia are twice as high.. “Somebody’s got it mispriced,” he said. “Either Georgia is too high or Tennessee is too low.”. The other major question is what effect BlueCross’s payment rates will have on the state’s hospitals and health systems. The low premiums in the Erlanger network have put additional pressure on the health system to lower its costs, an ongoing project for the system.. Already, CEO Kevin Spiegel outsourced the food service and cleaning operations. Surgeons have spearheaded other changes, such as reusing blades and other pieces of equipment they can sterilize. Big hazardous waste garbage bins in the operating room, which are costly to discard, have been swapped out for smaller ones to make doctors and nurses take more care to not add routine waste products to the hazardous materials.. “The days of the operating room being like a grocery store—What’s on the shelf? Anything you want—are over,” said Dr. Benjamin Dart, a trauma surgeon and chief of surgery.. Doctors whose surgeries cost more than those done by their peers are being pulled aside and gently confronted with data showing their outlying status. Dr. Paul Apyan, an orthopedic surgeon who recently sold his practice to Erlanger, said physicians increasingly are realizing they need to help the hospital keep down its costs. “There’s going to be a day when the hospital says ‘Paul, you can’t do that procedure here. You’re too expensive,’” he said. “That’s coming.” |Wed Aug 06 18:07:59 +0000 2014||RT @jordanrau: Second @KHNews look at super-cheap Tennessee premiums focuses on hospital-insurer dynamics |4.9708166689746944e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/August/06/Tennessee-Blues-bargaining-power-means-lower-premiums.aspx

. Employment rates for people with a serious mental illness are dismally low and getting worse, according to . . Just 17.8 percent of people receiving public mental health services were employed in 2012 – down from 23 percent in 2003.. 
. That’s an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent.. “It isn’t surprising,” says Sita Diehl, director of state policy at NAMI and author of the report.  The problem has less to with the workers themselves, she says, and more with the organizations that provide services for people with serious mental illness.  “We knew that mental health services really took it on the chin during the recession. Employment rates had already been dismal to begin with, and when the . , people with mental illness lost support and lost jobs.”. Rates of unemployment for people with mental illnesses varied greatly by state – from 92.6 percent in Maine to 56 percent in Wyoming.. Most adults with mental illness want to work, and six in 10 can succeed with the right supports, according to the report. Yet only 1.7 percent received supported employment services in 2012.. Without proper supports, many end up on expensive public programs including Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Income (SSDI). People with mental illnesses make up the largest and fastest growing group for both programs.. There are, however, several evidence-based programs to help individuals with mental illnesses find jobs and maintain them.. In La Crosse, Wis., for example, the Family and Children’s Center received funding to offer a supported employment program that currently serves 72 people.. One of them is Pierre Thomas, 30, who suffers from bipolar disorder.  After being released from a hospital, he ended up on the streets.. “I was going downhill and became homeless. I had basically lost everything – friends, family, I was going nowhere,” recalls Thomas.  One day, he stopped by the Family and Children’s Center, where he was connected with a case worker, mental health services and someone he calls his “job person,” who helped him land an interview at the local Hobby Lobby.. With his counselor’s assistance, he landed a job as a stocker in the back room.  They speak every day to “talk about what I can do to help be better at my job,” says Thomas, and she’s connected him with other organizations that helped him get work clothes and transportation.. “It’s built self-confidence,” explains Thomas. “Also it has basically opened the door to talk with other people and interact.”. But programs like the one in La Crosse are few and far between, and they tend to be unevenly implemented and funded in most states, says NAMI’s Diehl.. And .  can present a disincentive to find work, because beneficiaries who start a job may lose Medicaid or Medicare benefits. People in the programs have to prove that they are too sick to work full-time. If they make over a certain threshold, they can lose both their cash benefits and their health insurance.. “During recessions we see a spike in disability,” says David Wittenburg, a senior researcher at . . It’s a trend that has been made worse by a shifts in the labor market.  “There’s an increasing demand for high-skilled labor, and sometimes people with disabilities get left behind.”. Once on SSI or SSDI, he adds, people are unlikely to get off: “The most common reasons for leaving the programs are death or retirement.”. Despite the numbers, NAMI’s Diehl says there’s reason to be hopeful. “Things are coming together right now to really make this a turning point” for individuals with mental illness, she says.  The economy is improving, and the .  in combination with new insurance options offered under the Affordable Care Act give people new ways to maintain their mental health benefits without staying on Social Security programs.. Mental health coverage, for example, is now a mandated benefit on plans purchased in the individual and small group marketplaces. And people with a mental illness can no longer be denied coverage for having a preexisting condition.. NAMI is calling on state legislatures to bolster their employment assistance to take advantage of the new options.. “If we were able to bring those programs to scale, then people with mental illnesses would be able to live independently and contribute to their local economies,” says Diehl. “The health care cliff is going away.”"|Thu Jul 10 17:19:36 +0000 2014||RT @JennyAGold: 80% of adults with serious #mentalillness are unemployed |4.872850176857948e+17|http://bit.ly/1nbkw8z

But his wife, Jeannette, remembered she’d seen Dignity Health television commercials featuring a woman sitting in a hospital waiting room and then cutting to the same woman sitting on her living room couch as words come up on the screen: “Wait for the ER from home.” . “I’ve been in emergency rooms before, so I thought I’d see if this worked out,” she said, and went online to book an appointment for her husband at Dignity’s St. Mary’s Medical Center in San Francisco. . “They actually had an appointment that was within the hour. It was fast, it was convenient and there was also immediately confirmation we had the appointment,” she said. . Dignity Health, which runs a large network of hospitals out of its San Francisco headquarters, also offers online ER booking at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco and Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City as a way to overcome the frequently grueling emergency room wait times.. Dignity isn’t the only network employing the strategy. In an era of increased competition driven by the nation’s Affordable Care Act, hospital executives around the country are hoping online appointments will attract patients eager to avoid long waits in a crowded and often chaotic environment.. “It makes for a happier camper,” said Susan Dubuque, a national expert in hospital marketing. “When it comes to health care, consumers want more control over everything.”. Emergency room appointments are not intended for patients with serious emergencies — those with life-threatening, debilitating or urgent medical conditions. . Patients with chest pain, persistent bleeding or trouble breathing, for instance, are instructed to call 911 or go directly to an emergency room. Those with an ankle sprain or a fever, for instance, might be able to make an appointment. . At UCSF Medical Center, patients must explain in an online form the reason for their visit and check a box indicating they can wait for treatment until their scheduled appointment. Even then, they may be bumped by more seriously ill patients, but in most cases they will be seen soon after arrival.. The approach makes business sense for hospitals because it lets medical staff know who may be coming through the emergency room door and helps reduce crowding and decrease wait times, hospital executives say. They say the service also helps build a loyal clientele among patients.. Patients want to access health care the same way they do services in other industries, such as retail or travel, said Chris Song, a spokesman for InQuicker, a Nashville company that offers the online scheduling in California and 25 other states. . “When is the last time someone bought plane tickets at the gate?” he said.. UCSF Medical Center started using InQuicker in its emergency department in 2012 and expanded it a year later to its acute care clinic, where less-critical cases are handled on a same-day, walk-in basis. Now the system is also being used to book primary care appointments. . Under the former way of doing things, Eva Turner, assistant director of ambulatory services for UCSF’s primary care department, said patients were often frustrated because they had no way of knowing in advance if same-day acute-care appointments were still available. “Before (InQuicker), patients would park their car, pay the garage fee only to find out we can’t see them,” she said. . Some critics say the online check-in system may be convenient but is not necessarily cost-effective. It could encourage patients to seek care in the costliest of settings, emergency rooms, when they should be going to less-expensive urgent care centers or medical offices, they say.. If the country wants to decrease health care costs, patients need to be treated at the right place at the right time, said Del Morris, president of the California Academy of Family Physicians. Patients who can make appointments should do so at their doctors’ offices, he said.. “This sounds like it is the most expensive place,” said Morris, medical director of the Stanislaus County Health Services Agency. “Emergency rooms are there to take care of people who have emergencies.”. San Ramon Regional Medical Center began using InQuicker in 2012 and sees about 33 patients a month through the service. Most are people who have sore throats, ear aches and stomach pains, said Sue Micheletti, the hospital’s chief operating officer. . On the Web page where patients can select their time slot, they are given the option of looking for somewhere else for care: “Not an Emergency? Locate an Urgent Care Center near you.”. Patients appreciate the convenience of knowing approximately when they will be seen – and avoiding the emergency room crunch times, she said. “That is worth a lot to them,” she said. “When it rains, it pours. Our emergency room sometimes gets slammed.”. Loma Linda University Medical Center in San Bernardino County, however, stopped using InQuicker after too many patients who hadn’t made the appointments complained that others were walking in the door and being seen ahead of them.. The emergency room physicians liked it, but the nurses got tired of dealing with frustrated patients, said Kathleen Clem, chairwoman of the emergency medicine department.. Under the Affordable Care Act, however, Medicare reimbursements for hospitals are tied to results on patient surveys. . Dignity Health, which is also offering the online reservations at urgent care centers and doctors’ offices, hopes that the new service will boost those patient satisfaction scores at the same time it minimizes wait times, said chief nursing officer, Page West. . The hospital network, which operates 39 medical centers in three states, began offering online reservations with InQuicker about a year ago. Since then, roughly 12,000 patients have scheduled visits for emergency rooms at hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada, according to the company.. Bridget Duffy, chief medical officer at Vocera Communications in San Jose and an expert in the patient experience, said streamlining the emergency room experience for patients is necessary, but hospitals need do more. . They also need to assess patients quickly, improve communication with them and better manage their pain. Only then, she said, will hospitals be able to truly improve the patient experience.. For Scott Paul, the San Francisco patient, the emergency-room visit led to an appointment with a podiatrist a couple of days later, where he was fitted with a boot for a stress fracture. His only complaint is that everything happened so quickly he didn’t get a chance to watch the U.S. play Portugal in that afternoon’s World Cup game in the waiting room.. His wife had no such qualms: “We went to the emergency room and they said, ‘We were expecting you.’ ” |Mon Jul 07 16:27:27 +0000 2014||RT @charlesornstein: Hm.

. Consumer advocates and some legislators were surprised and frustrated when California health officials recently refused a $6 million donation to help people re-up their Medi-Cal health coverage.. Now two senators have proposed an unusual solution: a bill to force the state to accept the offer from The California Endowment.. Sens. Ed Hernandez and Mark Leno, both Democrats, said the money from the health care philanthropy is needed to help people through the process of keeping their health coverage. Moreover, taking the money would make the state eligible for another $6 million in matching funds from the federal government, they say.. “I can’t see leaving money on the table,” Hernandez said Thursday. “It doesn’t cost us a penny.”. The state Department of Finance, however, has said it doesn’t need the money. “We think this is just a duplication of efforts,” Keely Boster, chief deputy director of the department, said in a legislative hearing last month.. The state is already faced with a backlog of new Medi-Cal applicants because of the program’s expansion under the federal health law. Now, advocates say, it is imperiling continued access for existing beneficiaries.. “It’s a head scratcher to me,” said Kristen Golden Testa, health director of The Children’s Partnership, a nonprofit child advocacy organization. “Free money to help keep people covered seems to make a lot of sense to me.”. The decision was all the more perplexing given that California accepted a gift of $26.5 million last year from The California Endowment to help with expanded Medi-Cal enrollment, advocates said. Medi-Cal is the state’s version of the Medicaid program for low-income residents.. This time, the funds would be used help counties and community-based organizations complete renewals for beneficiaries, who must go through an annual process to ensure they continue to be eligible.. Advocates suggested that the state may not want the added cost of covering people who might otherwise drop out of the program – a common phenomenon among the poor and sometimes transient Medi-Cal population.. The state is responsible for about 50 percent of the costs of Medi-Cal beneficiaries eligible for coverage before Obamacare passed. The federal government is initially covering the entire cost for people who are newly eligible under the law.. If the state doesn’t accept the donated funds, about 3,600 people are expected to lose coverage, saving the state more than $8 million, according to a finance department document.. “We are very concerned that the state is putting up a lot of roadblocks,” said Judy Darnell, director of public policy at United Ways of California.. The Affordable Care Act expanded those eligible for Medi-Cal to childless adults and people who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 for an individual and $27,000 for a family of three. California enrolled nearly two million people in the program, bringing the state’s total to 10.6 million. In addition, the state is facing the backlog of about 600,000 new applications.. At the same time, as many as one million beneficiaries each month are expected to seek annual renewals of their coverage, according to the Department of Health Care Services.. Department of Health Care Services spokesman Tony Cava said the renewals and the new applications together is “quite a large task” for the counties. “It is all happening at the same time,” he said.. Cava said he could not comment on the pending legislation.. Sen. Leno said at a recent legislative hearing that failing to accept the funds from The California Endowment “would be bureaucratic waste at its worst.”. “To deny this offer of financial support would be counterproductive and antithetical to the very reason that we did participate in Medi-Cal expansion,” he said.. New rules make the renewals different and more confusing this year, according to Elizabeth Landsberg of the Western Center on Law & Poverty, one of the co-sponsors of the Senate bill.. “Anything we can do to help consumers … will help streamline the process,” she said."|Sun Jul 06 20:08:34 +0000 2014||RT @annagorman: Advocates Say California Is Rejecting Free Money To Renew Insurance |4.858779910888653e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/07/advocates-say-california-is-rejecting-free-money-to-renew-poor-peoples-insurance/

|It’s not just veterans who are having trouble with health care. Now the health system for active duty military is under the microscope, too.. Longstanding issues with an overburdened system for caring for the nation’s veterans have burst into the news recently, particularly with allegations of fraudulent record-keeping to hide the size of the .  at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System. . And just this week, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered .  in the military health system. That action came following .  that led to the sacking of several top officials there, although Defense officials said the actions were unrelated. . Yet the VA and military health systems are completely separate entities. They are not even part of the same cabinet department – the VA system is part of the . , while the military system is overseen by the . . Here are some common questions about the two systems.. The Veterans Health Administration, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, is a system of approximately 1,700 hospitals, outpatient clinics, counseling centers and long-term care facilities that provides care to nearly 9 million veterans annually. Congress has .  for VA health care services and facilities for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. Unlike Medicare, where the federal government pays for care provided by private doctors and hospitals, VA facilities are owned and run by the federal government, and its health care providers are largely, although not exclusively, government employees.  . Through agreements with various medical, dental and other medical education programs, the VA has become the single largest provider of health care training in the country. In 2013 VA facilities participated in the training of more than . . . Just about any individual who serves on active duty in the armed forces and is discharged other than dishonorably is technically eligible to receive health services from the VA. . But because demand far outstrips capacity, the VA health system, under orders from Congress, .  to provide care to those deemed most in need. The top priority group consists of those who are more than 50 percent disabled as a result of their military service and/or deemed unemployable due to conditions connected to their service. The second group are veterans with slightly less severe disabilities;  the third group  includes those who are former POWs or who were awarded Purple Hearts or Medals of Honor. There are currently  eight groups; rankings include not only health status, but also income and age.. Dependents of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled or who die of a service-connected disability can qualify for . , a health insurance program that largely uses private doctors and hospitals to provide care. Unlike active-duty military, most other veterans’ dependents do not qualify for government-paid or subsidized care. . This is at the heart of the current debate, but there is general agreement that a number of factors are converging to put significant pressure on the VA health care system. One is simply the aging of baby boom-era Vietnam veterans, whose medical needs are increasing.  Another is a large influx of wounded warriors from more than a dozen years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan with  serious disabilities. A third factor is recent changes in the law making it easier for veterans who were exposed to .  or to hazardous substances in .  to qualify for benefits.. The military – the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard – has its own integrated health care system known as the . . In addition to providing medical care in combat situations and at bases overseas (as well as on ships), the system has 57 hospitals and 400 clinics. . The military also has its own medical school, the . , in Bethesda, Maryland, on the campus of what was the Bethesda Naval Hospital and is now the merged . . The university trains doctors, dentists, nurses and PhD scientists. . Like the VA, however, the military’s health facilities cannot accommodate the demand for care by all active duty service people, their dependents, and retirees (many of whom are not eligible for VA services). So it has its own government-provided insurance plan, called . , for those who cannot get care at a military health hospitals or clinics. . TRICARE, much like Medicare, is insurance that is paid by the government, but uses private doctors and hospitals. In fact, TRICARE rates are . . |Fri May 30 16:39:11 +0000 2014||RT @jrovner: Do you know the diff between the VA and the military health system? here's my guide: |4.724169472931512e+17|http://bit.ly/1kOXNCD

|Advocates for a single-payer “Medicare for all” health system are fanning out across Capitol Hill this week, lobbying members of Congress.. But years of mostly fruitless struggles – and watching the intense opposition to the much less sweeping Affordable Care Act – appears to have left them with a much more clear-eyed view of what it will take for them to accomplish their goal.. “This is tough stuff,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., told a roundtable of advocates he convened in the Dirksen Senate Office Building. “Single-payer health care bills – it ain’t going to take place here in Washington. I suspect it’s going to take place, as it did in Canada, with a state [Saskatchewan] going forward. I hope it will be my state.”. Indeed, Vermont in 2011 passed legislation that would make it the first state to create its own single-payer system, called “. .” The experiment is set to launch in 2017, the first year that’s allowed under the Affordable Care Act. But key decisions about exactly how the plan would work, in particular how it would be financed, have . .. Meanwhile, those who have been pushing for a system that would effectively end private insurance say there’s no question they have the facts on their side.. “What we know about single-payer has zero to do with the merits,” said Robert Weissman of Public Citizen, referring to widespread charges by opponents that single payer systems are inefficient and can deny care. “We have proven alternatives in every other industrialized country in the world – better outcomes at less cost.”. That’s challenged, of course, by single-payer opponents who maintain that other countries keep costs down less by being more efficient and more by . .. The advocates even took on the ongoing . , where former service members have reportedly been dying while waiting to get care – despite the fact that the VA system is fully government-run, and not the same as single-payer, where doctors and hospitals would remain private, with payment from the government.. “If the VA had the resources it needed to work, it would be a model for government-provided health care,” said Michael Lighty of the National Nurses United union.. For the moment, however, the single-payer advocates recognize that their mission is to convince a public that is clearly unhappy with the status quo in health care that a single-payer system is a potential option.. “The most important thing is to show people that change is possible,” said Gerald Friedman, an economics professor from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. “That’s the role that Vermont has had – showing that it’s possible to get something done.”. And the Affordable Care Act may in fact be nudging the effort along, panelists said. With predictions that many employers will eventually push their workers onto the new health exchanges, “we face a fundamental choice in the long term,” said Lighty of the nurse’s union. “We either are going to have single-payer or individual purchase.”. And single-payer advocates are increasingly confident that’s a fight they can win. Even if it may not be any time soon.|Wed May 21 22:36:40 +0000 2014||RT @jrovner: Single-payer people are back.

|One of the main ways the Affordable Care Act seeks to reduce health care costs is by encouraging doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to form networks that coordinate patient care and become eligible for bonuses when they deliver that care more efficiently.. The law takes a carrot-and-stick approach by encouraging the formation of accountable care organizations (ACOs) in the Medicare program. Providers make more if they keep their patients healthy. About 6 million Medicare beneficiaries are now in an ACO, and, combined with the private sector, at least . have become ACOs since 2011. An estimated 23.5 million Americans are now being served by an ACO. You may even be in one and not know it.. While ACOs are touted as a way to help fix an inefficient payment system that rewards more, not better, care, some economists warn they could lead to greater consolidation in the health care industry, which could allow some providers to charge more if they’re the only game in town. . ACOs have become one of the most talked about new ideas in Obamacare. Here are answers to some common questions about how they work:. An ACO is a network of doctors and hospitals that shares financial and medical responsibility for providing coordinated care to patients in hopes of limiting unnecessary spending. At the heart of each patient’s care is a primary care physician.. In Obamacare, each ACO .  the health care needs of a minimum of 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries for at least three years.. Think of it as buying a television, says Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform in Pittsburgh, Pa. A TV manufacturer like Sony may contract with many suppliers to build sets. Like Sony does for TVs, Miller says, an ACO brings together the different component parts of care for the patient – primary care, specialists, hospitals, home health care, etc. – and ensures that all of the “parts work well together.”. The problem with most health systems today, Miller says, is that patients are getting each part of their health care separately. “People want to buy individual circuit boards, not a whole TV,” he says. “If we can show them that the TV works better, maybe they’ll buy it,” rather than assembling a patchwork of services themselves.. As lawmakers searched for ways to reduce the national deficit, Medicare became a prime target. With baby boomers entering retirement age, the costs of caring for elderly and disabled Americans are expected to soar.. The health law created the . . In it, ACOs make providers jointly accountable for the health of their patients, giving them financial incentives to cooperate and save money by avoiding unnecessary tests and procedures. For ACOs to work, they have to seamlessly share information. Those that save money while also meeting quality targets keep a portion of the savings. Providers can choose to be at risk of losing money if they want to aim for a bigger reward, or they can enter the program with no risk at all.. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created a second strategy, called the . , for .  to pocket more of the expected savings in exchange for taking on greater financial risk.. In 2014, the 20 ACOs in the Medicare Pioneer Program and 333 in the Medicare Shared Savings .   but after paying bonuses, . . That’s far less than 1 percent of Medicare spending during that period.. Still the program is expected to be expanded and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has .  of tying 50 percent of all traditional Medicare payments to quality or value by 2018 through new payment models, including ACOs.. In Medicare’s traditional fee-for-service payment system, doctors and hospitals generally are paid for each test and procedure. That drives up costs, experts say, by rewarding providers for doing more, even when it’s not needed. ACOs don’t do away with fee for service, but they create an incentive to be more efficient by offering bonuses when providers keep costs down. Doctors and hospitals have to meet specific quality benchmarks, focusing on prevention and carefully managing patients with chronic diseases. In other words, providers get paid more for keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital.. If an ACO is unable to save money, it could be stuck with the costs of investments made to improve care, such as adding new nurse care managers. An ACO also may have to pay a penalty if it doesn’t meet performance and savings benchmarks, although few have opted into that program yet. ACOs sponsored by physicians or rural providers, however, can apply to receive payments .  to help them build the infrastructure necessary for coordinated care – a concession the Obama administration made after complaints from rural hospitals.. In 2014, the third year of the Medicare ACO program.  qualified for shared savings payments of more than $422 million.. Doctors and hospitals will likely refer patients to hospitals and specialists within the ACO network. But patients are usually still free to see doctors of their choice outside the network without paying more. Providers who are part of an ACO are required to alert their patients, who can choose to go to another doctor if they are uncomfortable participating. The patient can decline to have his data shared within the ACO.. ACOs can include hospitals, specialists, post-acute providers and even private companies like Walgreens. The only must-have element is primary care physicians, who serve as the linchpin of the program.. In private ACOs, insurers can also play a role, though they aren’t in charge of medical care. Some regions of the country, including parts of California, already had large multi-specialty physician groups that became ACOs on their own by networking with neighboring hospitals.. In other regions, large hospital systems are scrambling to buy up physician practices with the goal of becoming ACOs that directly employ the majority of their providers. Because hospitals usually have access to capital, they may have an .  than doctors in financing the initial investment, for instance to create the electronic record system necessary to track patients.. Some of the largest health insurers in the country, including Humana, UnitedHealth and Aetna, have formed their own ACOs for the private market. Insurers say they are essential to the success of an ACO because they track and collect the data on patients that allow systems to evaluate patient care and report on the results.. ACOs may sound a lot like health maintenance organizations. “Some people say ACOs are HMOs in drag,” says Kelly Devers, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. But there are some critical differences – notably, an ACO patient is not required to stay in the network.. Steve Lieberman, a consultant and senior adviser to the Health Policy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., explains that ACOs aim to replicate “the performance of an HMO” in holding down the cost of care while avoiding “the structural features that give the HMO control over [patient] referral patterns,” which limited patient options and created a consumer backlash in the 1990s.. In addition, unlike HMOs, the ACOs must meet a long list of quality measures to ensure they are not saving money by stinting on necessary care.. Many health care economists fear that the race to form ACOs could have a significant downside: hospital mergers and provider consolidation. As hospitals position themselves to become integrated systems, many are joining forces and purchasing physician practices, leaving fewer independent hospitals and doctors. Greater market share gives these health systems more leverage in negotiations with insurers, which can drive up health costs and limit patient choice.. But Lieberman says while ACOs could accelerate the merger trend, consolidations are already “such a powerful and pervasive trend that it’s a little like worrying about the calories I get when I eat the maraschino cherry on top of my hot fudge sundae. It’s a serious public policy issue with or without ACOs.”. ACOs are already becoming pervasive, but they may be just an interim step on the way to a more efficient American health care system. “ACOs aren’t the end game,” says Chas Roades, chief research officer at The Advisory Board Company in Washington.. One of the key challenges for hospitals and physicians is that the incentives in ACOs are to reduce hospital stays, emergency room visits and expensive specialist and testing services — all the ways that hospitals and physicians make money in the fee-for-service system, explains Roades.. He says the ultimate goal would be for providers to take on full financial responsibility for caring for a population of patients for a fixed payment, but that will require a transition beyond ACOs.|Wed Apr 16 15:12:50 +0000 2014||RT @JennyAGold: What the heck is an #ACO?

|When America’s joint surgeons were challenged to come up with a list of unnecessary procedures in their field, their selections shared one thing: none significantly impacted their incomes.. The .  patients with joint pain from taking two types of dietary supplements, wearing custom shoe inserts or overusing wrist splints after carpal tunnel surgery. The surgeons also condemned an infrequently performed procedure where doctors wash a pained knee joint with saline. . “They could have chosen many surgical procedures that are commonly done, where evidence has shown over the years that they don’t work or where they’re being done with no evidence,” said Dr. James Rickert, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Indiana University. “They chose stuff of no material consequence that nobody really does.”. The medical profession has historically been reluctant to condemn unwarranted but often lucrative tests and treatments that can rack up costs to patients but not improve their health and can sometimes hurt them. But in 2012, medical specialty societies began .  of at least five services that both doctors and patients should consider skeptically. So far, 54 specialty societies have each offered recommendations and distributed them to more than a half-million doctors.. Hospitals that have deployed the lists, including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, report that the frequency of superfluous procedures has dropped. Consumer Reports, AARP and Univision are some of the influential organizations that have been part of a broad campaign to educate patients about the questionable items. Dr. Donald Berwick, a former head of Medicare, .  the “. ” campaign as “a game-changer” because the “advice comes not from payers or politicos, but from pedigreed physician groups.”. Yet some of the largest medical associations selected rare services or ones that are done by practitioners in other fields and will not affect their earnings. “They were willing to throw someone else’s services into the arena, but not their own,” said Dr. Nancy Morden, a researcher at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice in New Hampshire.. Some specialists did target their own money-makers. Gastroenterologists, radiologists and clinical pathologists all placed their own tests on their lists. The Society of General Internal Medicine recommended against the annual physical exam, a mainstay of American health care.. Other specialty groups said they did not include their own procedures where there are concerns of overuse, such as stents for heart patients and spine surgery, because the evidence is murky and the procedures are right for some patients. “What we did when we made up the list was to start with more straightforward situations and hopefully expand that later,” said Dr. F. Todd Wetzel, a member of the board of directors of the North American Spine Society.. Those societies tended to focus on limiting testing that others do. In .  in the New England Journal of Medicine, Morden examined all the items on the first 26 Choosing Wisely lists. She found that 83 percent of the items targeted radiology, medications and cardiac and lab tests—not physician services.. The American College of Cardiology opted to list the use of cardiac testing in four circumstances. But the college did not tackle what studies suggest is the most frequent type of overtreatment in the field: inserting small mesh tubes called stents to prop open arteries of patients who are not suffering heart attacks, rather than first prescribing medicine or encouraging  a healthier lifestyle. As many as one out of eight of these stent procedures should not have been performed, according . , the journal of the American Heart Association.  At hospitals where stenting was most overused, 59 percent of stents were inappropriate, the study found.. “Let’s face it, angioplasty and stenting is a big business, it’s highly profitable for hospitals, and it’s highly remunerative for physicians,” said Dr. William Boden, a New York cardiologist who oversaw the first large trials that found no advantage for stents for patients who are not in acute distress. “There’s a tremendous impetus to not rock the boat and not to call attention to the fact that we do too many procedures in stable patients for whom outcomes would be the same if not even better if treated medically.”. Dr. William Zoghbi, a Houston cardiologist who was president of the college when the list was announced in 2012, rejected the suggestion that stenting procedures should have been more broadly questioned, saying “the vast majority” of stents “are quite appropriate for the condition.” He said cautious choices for the initial list made sense because a campaign like Choosing Wisely is unfamiliar to doctors. “You have to walk before you run,” Zoghbi said.. The cardiologists did discourage one specific use of stenting, where doctors opening a clogged artery place additional stents in other places where screenings have spotted the starts of blockage. Dr. Vikas Saini, a Massachusetts cardiologist and president of the Lown Institute, which advocates for more restraint in treatments, said, “in 20 years of practice that’s not something I would have thought is standard and if people are still doing it, that’s a shame.”. Stents are a profit center for the group of cardiologists who perform procedures, often known as invasive cardiologists. They earned a median salary of $488,000, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Orthopedic surgeons do even better: half earned more than $538,000 in 2012, according to the . .. The orthopedic academy defended its Choosing Wisely selections, writing in a statement that “our recommendations are limited by the existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of various treatment options for musculoskeletal conditions, which we are seeking to improve.” It noted that its recommendation against the dietary supplements could save patients $750 million a year spent on these drugs.. The orthopedists’ selections did not impress critics. Rickert, the Indiana orthopedist, noted that discouraging dietary supplements affects revenue for health stores and other retail outlets, not surgeons. Both he and Morden said saline injections to treat knee pain are seldom done. Morden said when she searched 2011 Medicare billing records for the procedure, “I found zero claims.”. “That’s how pathetic that item is,” she said.. Dr. Augusto Sarmiento, a former president of the academy and retired chairman of orthopedics at the University of Miami Miller Medical School, said there were more significant overused procedures the academy omitted, including replacing hips and knees when the patient’s pain is minimal and can be managed with medicine.. In addition, Sarmiento said too many surgeons operate on simple fractured collarbones, inserting metal plates, rather than letting the injury heal with the help of a sling. “The abuse of surgery is due to the overwhelming control of the profession by the implant manufacturing companies,” he said.. The median compensation of a spine surgeon is more than $730,000, according to MGMA’s survey. It is unclear how many spine surgeons are still performing a procedure the North American Spine Society placed . : using bone growth material in spinal fusion in the neck. The Food and Drug Administration .  against this in 2008, noting that the procedure had led to the swelling of neck tissue that compressed patients’ airways, making it hard to breathe or speak.. “I think the use for that purpose has already fallen off substantially,” said Dr. Richard Deyo, a professor at Oregon Health & Science University and spine researcher. “They’ve taken on the easy things.”. The only other procedure the society mentioned was spinal injections, but it was to expand, not restrict their work: They encouraged doctors to do their injections with the help of imaging, which would tack on another expense. The group also did not address spinal fusion, which has more than doubled in frequency between 1998 and 2008, faster than most procedures, . .  Other .  that patients with back pain were increasingly likely to get a physician referral, “presumably for consideration of treatments such as injections and surgery” while referrals for physical therapy stayed flat over a decade.. Wetzel, the spine society official and an orthopedic surgeon at Temple University Medical School in Philadelphia, said that since spinal fusion has been shown to be useful “under very specific circumstances,” the society “didn’t feel comfortable making any kind of blanket statement.”. The importance of which items are included is not just an academic debate, because where the lists have been actively embraced, the rate of those services has dropped. Last year, the Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles added 120 Choosing Wisely recommendations into its computerized patient records so that they would pop up on a screen whenever a clinician tried to authorize one.. “The alerts fire about 100 times a day,” said Dr. Scott Weingarten, Cedar-Sinai’s chief clinical transformation officer. For example, he said, there has been a decrease in the use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics to treat the elderly, as they result in more falls, following a recommendation from the American Geriatrics Society for Choosing Wisely.. “We’ve got a bunch of other countries knocking on our door,” said Dr. Richard Baron, president of the . , which solicited the Choosing Wisely lists from the specialties. “There’s a . .  There are health systems using it, insurers are using it.”. Dr. John Santa, medical director for Consumer Reports, said reducing tests is a worthy goal because test results often prompt patients to get procedures. He cited . , which are used to measure the heart’s electrical activity to diagnose heart disease.  “Some people would say, it’s a $50 test, it’s harmless,” Santa said. “The false positives you get from EKGs can cause significant downstream problems. You may think you may have just been brilliant in detecting some abnormality. That’s how stents get put in.”. In Annapolis, Md., the Anne Arundel Medical Center broadcasts “Choosing Wisely” lists on hospital television screens, places posters on the walls of doctors’ offices and discusses the lists in its magazine that it mails to county residents. The lists are also embedded as links in electronic patient records so physicians can easily review them.. Dr. Barry Meisenberg, an oncologist in charge of the hospital’s quality efforts, said the lists are helpful when he is trying to explain to disappointed patients why he is not ordering a particular test. “It does help that’s not just this guy’s opinion, it actually has the imprimatur of a society,” he said.|Tue Apr 15 11:43:19 +0000 2014||"RT @jordanrau: In Choosing Wisely, MDs ""chose stuff of no material consequence that nobody really does.""  via @khnews"|4.5603503260043264e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/April/14/doctors-overlook-own-lucrative-procedures-when-naming-others-unwise.aspx

|Paige Wolf has been buying health insurance from Independence Blue Cross for years. So when the self-employed public relations professional learned that she could buy a top-of-the-line platinum plan for less than her old policy, she was ecstatic. . But her good fortune turned to frustration when the Center City woman didn’t receive an invoice for her new plan. She went on Independence’s Facebook page to vent. Then she received an e-mail scan of an overdue notice for her January bill, with her doctor’s address on it, not hers.. The insurer, she said, should do something for its customers – though she isn’t holding her breath. “I certainly don’t expect a Starbucks gift card any time soon,” she said. . The region’s biggest insurers, Independence and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, have been the most aggressive companies in offering new plans under the Affordable Care Act, which began Jan. 1. . Now they, too, are dealing with a wave of disgruntled customers, who are complaining on social media of long waits for service and an inability to confirm coverage. . On Horizon’s Facebook page this week, one customer groused that she spent 36 hours on the phone trying to resolve enrollment issues that “were entirely your [Horizon’s] fault.” . And on Jan. 8, Independence posted an apology “to our members who have experienced delays in accessing our website and call centers.” . Both Horizon and Independence say the backlog is improving, and is rooted in the federal government’s decision to shorten the enrollment deadline for people to sign up for plans to Jan. 1. . Horizon enrolled 56 percent of its new members between Dec. 15 and 24. “We extended service hours, tripled our customer service staffing, and delayed the payment-due date for the first month’s premium until last Friday,” said Thomas Vincz, a Horizon spokesman. . From Dec. 10 to 24, Independence took in 80 percent of its new members. . Now its call center is receiving 20,000 calls a day, a 30 percent jump over last January. . Independence has been “working around the clock” to insure that its customers are receiving the service they need, said Brian Lobley, senior vice president for marketing and consumer business. . “Earlier this month, our members may have been on hold an average of 20 minutes before their calls were answered,” said Lobley, noting that some people were on hold for up to an hour. “This week the average time has been less than 10 minutes.” . Lobley said Independence planned for the influx of new members by ramping up its call center staff by 25 percent to 600 people. And while no one anticipated the actual spike in volume, he said, the real unknown has been the amount of time each call requires. . “What has taken us by surprise is the length of the phone calls,” he said. “We have folks who are new to insurance, and they are not four- to five-minute calls. They are more of a 15- to 20-minute conversation.” . Some customers have complained that once they get through, they are passed from representative to representative. Lobley said that happens when customers with previous coverage use an old membership card that is no longer valid. . “We are actually using some of our telesales reps who really understand our products so we can alleviate folks experiencing long hold times,” he said. . Compounding the problem, Lobley said, is the number of people who signed up on healthcare.gov in October and November, when the site was balky, and then signed up a second and even a third time to be safe. . Each of those applications has to be checked and the person contacted to confirm which plan they want. . January is also when large group insurance plans are renewed, making it the insurer’s busiest month of the year, he said. . “If you go to our Facebook page, you will see we are really actively responding to everyone’s complaint or issue,” he said. “We shoot for 24 hours.” . An Independence representative did contact Wolf and fix the issues with her plan. “I’m happy with the insurance that I have,” she said. “I’m paying less than I was and I got better coverage.”|Fri Jan 24 16:03:56 +0000 2014||Philadelphia-Area Blues Struggle To Match Customer Service To Demand -- |4.267472029551329e+17|http://hub.am/1jsEv6c

|Nationally, Republican party leaders say their number one campaign issue for the midterm elections is opposition to Obamacare. But at the same time, a growing number of Republican states are now embracing a major provision of the law – expanding Medicaid, the government-funded health benefit program for the poor. The Supreme Court made doing that optional for states in 2012 and most Republican-led states said “no”. But now, some states like Ohio, Iowa and Michigan are forging compromises with the White House on Medicaid.. To understand why this happened in Michigan, drop in on the cavernous, busy .  in the heart of Detroit. About .  patients being treated by the blue-scrubbed swarm of doctors, nurses and techs is uninsured. It’s a much higher rate than in Michigan or the rest of the country, and that means hospitals like this one had been providing a lot of health care for free.. Henry Ford Hospital CEO Nancy Schlichting says even as .  in the last decade, the amount of care the institution provides for free increased.. “About seven or eight years ago we were at about $100 million a year. We’re now at $240 million a year in uncompensated care,” she says.. So when the Affordable Care Act offered Michigan the chance to give Medicaid benefits to . , Schlichting lobbied hard for the state to say “yes.”. “We were very active in advocacy,” she says. “We got all of our employees engaged. We had over 5,000 emails that went to state legislators, as they were debating the Medicaid expansion for the state of Michigan. We almost shamed people into it, you know, ‘How can you turn your back on the people of this state, who have lost jobs?”. But Republicans initially saw themselves as turning their backs on Obamacare, not the people of Michigan. State Rep. Al Pscholka was one of them.. Pscholka’s district, on the southeast shore of Lake Michigan, is a solidly Republican area so Obamacare doesn’t have a lot of fans there, he says: “When people say Medicaid expansion, I think to a lot of us that meant bigger government, and it meant expanding a program that doesn’t work very well.”. Pscholka is a Republican party leader in the Michigan House. He was asked to look at ways to reform Medicaid. But then Republican governor, Rick Snyder, .  of Medicaid expansion last year. Snyder argued that if the state didn’t expand, the millions of dollars in Affordable Care Act taxes and fees Michigan would be paying would just go to other states, and not come back home in the form of new payments to hospitals and doctors.. Furthermore, Pscholka says when he took a hard look at Medicaid, he didn’t find the broken, bloated government program he was expecting.. “When I understood how it worked, and what we had done in Michigan in the late ’90s, that was actually pretty smart, we’ve privatized a lot of that already, which I think a lot of folks didn’t understand,” says Pscholka.. Medicaid is a government-funded program, but Michigan long ago started contracting with .  to administer it. The idea was to use private market incentives to increase efficiency. Pscholka says that makes it easier for conservatives to stomach, and he helped draft legislation to accept federal. Medicaid expansion dollars, but with some conditions.. The bill passed by one vote in the state Senate.. “This is not an easy thing to explain.” Pscholka says. “It’s not an easy thing to get up at a . , and look at friends of mine, who’ve been friends of mine for 20 years, who are now shooting darts at me with their eyes, and can’t believe that I was even involved in this. Not only that I voted for it, but that I was somehow involved in crafting this legislation.”. Pscholka’s change of heart on Medicaid earned him a primary challenge from Tea Party candidate . . But she’s a longshot to beat him, and those favoring expansion have some strong allies beyond Michigan’s popular governor. . , .  and the state’s .  all rallied behind the idea.. Cynthia Kay, who owns .  with eight employees in Grand Rapids, hopes putting more people on Medicaid will help keep the price of her company’s health insurance plan down in the future.. “If you think about it, we’re paying for the cost of health care anyway,” Kay says. “Uncompensated cost of care is driving my premiums up every single year. So, whether I think I’m paying for it or not, I’m paying for all the people who are using the emergency room as their primary care physician.”. Advocates for the poor are thrilled so many uninsured Michigan residents will now be able to get Medicaid, but they worry about some significant details that have yet to be finalized.. Among the compromises the White House made to win Republican support in Michigan are requirements for some Medicaid recipients to pay for at least part of their care, according to . , a senior policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, which advocates for low income people. That could include co-pays for physician office visits and procedures.. “Cost sharing is always a concern for low-income people. The research says that that can be a barrier to people receiving the care that they need,” Hudson says.. Still, the White House is .  in Iowa and Arkansas. Iowa recipients will pay extra if they overuse emergency rooms, and Michigan will charge them more if they don’t stick with wellness plans designed to keep them healthy.. Groups that favor Medicaid expansion nationwide point to those kinds of requirements as evidence that the White House is willing to compromise, and hope that will entice the .  to take another look and work out special arrangements of their own..  |Mon Jan 20 23:08:15 +0000 2014||RT @EricReporter: How the GOP in Michigan learned to embrace #Obamacare #Medicaid expansion. @khnews  |4.2540443599754854e+17|http://bit.ly/1aFKCMf

Enrollment in the health law’s marketplaces surged in December, and the administration’s report on the numbers .  — but the national story isn’t the whole story. Health care is delivered in 50 different state markets, and each state is implementing the health law with varying degrees of success and failure, enthusiasm and hostility.. Reporters at NPR member stations around the country dove into the data the Obama administration released and delivered these dispatches..  Carrie Feibel of KUHF in Houston . , “Texas was one of the top five states for sign-ups; 118,000 Texans have signed up since October 1. Supporters of the law cheered the fact that 80 percent of the people who signed up found out they qualified for financial assistance to help pay for a policy.” About one in four Texans is uninsured, the highest rate in the nation, and Texas is second only to California in the number of people who are uninsured..  Early on, California health officials said they wanted to be .  on the health law, and so far, they are on track. Stephanie O’Neill of Southern California Public Radio .  “nearly 499,000 Californians had signed up for insurance through Covered California, (the state’s marketplace). That means three-and-a-half times as many people enrolled in December . . … Additionally, 25 percent of all enrollees fell into the coveted 18 to 34 age group,  a four percent uptick from the cumulative October and November numbers. Members of this group –  known as the Young Invincibles  – are important because they are typically healthier, which is . ”.  On the other end of the spectrum, Elana Gordon of WHYY .  in Delaware just one in seven of the people who had signed up are under 30. “As of last week, 3,183 people in Delaware had signed up for coverage, up from 793 in mid-December,” Gordon says. “Those between the ages of 51 to 64 dominated, making up nearly half of all sign-ups.” The state estimates about 90,000 people are uninsured in Delaware..  In another sparsely populated state, Annie Feidt of Alaska Public Radio Network . . About 3,000 people selected marketplace plans before Dec. 28 and 83 percent qualified for a subsidy to help pay for premiums. “But Enroll Alaska has seen a steep drop off in the number of people signing up for insurance in the New Year,” Feidt said. “In the last few weeks of 2013, (Enroll Alaska) was signing up as many as 70 Alaskans a day for insurance. As soon as January 1st hit, that figure plunged by more than half.”.  Alaska, Delaware, and Texas all rely on healthcare.gov, the federal website that was extremely balky for the first two months of its operation. Oregon’s dysfunctional website was homegrown — and it .  isn’t fully functional. Despite this, Kristian Foden-Vencil of Oregon Public Broadcasting, .  the state is in the middle of the pack: “By late December, Oregon had enrolled about 18,000 people via the website, with the help of state navigators. That’s more than 23 other states for the same time period.”.  Another state running its own exchange is Colorado, which has signed up 59,000 people for private insurance and another 81,000 for expanded Medicaid, .  for Colorado Public Radio. Whitney says that Connect for Health Colorado is going to shift its advertising in the coming months. “Since opening October 1, the group’s marketing messages have focused on the benefits of health insurance,” Whitney says. “Now, the messages will start reminding people they face a tax penalty if they don’t have health coverage this year.”.  Like Oregon, Minnesota has a state-run exchange that has weathered many problems, culminating in a change of leadership. Minnesota Public Radio’s Elizabeth Stawicki .  lawmakers are trying to ferret out what went wrong in hearings. “Meanwhile, about 72,000 Minnesotans have signed up for coverage as of the end of the year,” Stawicki says. “Of those, about two-thirds are receiving government coverage such as Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare. About 26,000 have signed up for commercial insurance. Of those, the median age has dropped a couple years to age 48.”.  Lawmakers are grilling exchange officials in New York too, where 156,902 people had signed up for private coverage by the end of December, WNYC’s . : “Several members of the Senate Health Committee relayed complaints from their constituents on everything from lack of Spanish translation to unclear listings of eligible doctors and hospitals.” The panel heard from an opthalmologist who had been dropped from the Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield network as a provider. “At the same time,” Mogul writes, “she also held an Empire plan for herself and her husband and her employees, and she discovered their physicians were no longer in-network, either.”. “Every single one of us were losing our doctors – 100% of our doctors,” Dr. Patricia McLaughlin told the committee."|Thu Jan 16 17:15:02 +0000 2014||State Snapshots Of Obamacare Enrollment Numbers |4.238659913457541e+17|http://hub.am/1gQLQIB

|A security flaw has been fixed on . , Minnesota’s health insurance marketplace — one that had left users vulnerable to data interception by hackers.. The fix follows an .  and a .  between forensic analyst Mark Lanterman and the state’s chief information security officer, Chris Buse. At the meeting, Lanterman explained how he discovered the flaw and how the state could resolve the problem.. Lanterman tested for the flaw again Tuesday.  “I’m happy to report that MNsure is no longer vulnerable to this attack,” he said.. The problem was complex, but it came down to this:  MNsure’s flaw allowed private data to be transmitted unencrypted, leaving consumers’ personal information unprotected.. As people access a website, there’s a lot of communication between their computers or smartphones and the site’s servers. When sensitive information, such as a credit card number, is involved, websites typically offer a secure, encrypted connection so no one can eavesdrop and steal the information. Many websites protect users by severing connections to other computers if encryption is not working correctly.. But that was not true in this case.. Here’s one way this flaw could be exploited: A hacking device can offer up what appears to be a standard Wi-Fi connection to the Internet. But when a user connects to a website through that device’s Internet connection, it attempts to strip away security measures. In the case of the MNsure site, that would allow a hacker to see the  users’ log-ins.. Since that tool works like a standard Wi-Fi router, it can capture information coming from computers or smartphones within a range of as much as 150 yards, according to Lanterman. This would allow a hacker to set up near libraries, coffee shops or other locations where computer users expect to find safe Wi-Fi connections.. But in those instances, MNsure’s website continued to permit users to send sensitive data.. The flaw in the site is now fixed.. Forensic professionals legally use devices like these to detect security weaknesses in wireless networks.  But in the wrong hands, they are a hacker’s best friend.. Buse said the MNsure site is safe and always has been. Still, he called website security an ongoing journey. He said that although new threats appear daily, chances are slim that a hacker could use a device to convince a computer that it is connected to MNsure. He said a successful attack requires several elements, among them a high level of sophistication, the right tools and close proximity to the user.. “So when you think of all these things happening in the real world, this type of attack has a pretty low probability of actually occurring to anybody that’s planning to go to the MNsure site,” Buse said.. But Lanterman disagreed.  He said there’s no way to know how widespread an attack could be, because using it leaves no trace.. The security problems at MNsure are just one aspect of a rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota. On Tuesday the executive director of the exchange April Todd-Malmlov resigned .  about an ill-timed tropical vacation and various problems with the site.|Thu Dec 19 22:52:20 +0000 2013||RT @AEIHealth: From @KHNews , after exposure, security holes sealed in Minnesota's exchange |4.1380401935499264e+17|http://ow.ly/rW4hf

|Consumers will have an extra week — until Dec. 23 — to enroll in health insurance coverage that begins Jan. 1, Obama administration officials said Friday.. Millions of consumers have been frustrated by their inability to sign up for coverage through healthcare.gov, the federal website for residents of 36 states, which went public Oct. 1.  While the administration has said the site will work smoothly for most customers by Nov. 30, some advocates had been concerned that consumers still might not have enough time to sign up for coverage that would take effect Jan. 1. The previous deadline was Dec. 15.. In a call with reporters, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Communications Director Julie Bataille said the extension would apply only for consumers seeking coverage effective Jan. 1. In future months, consumers would have to enroll by the 15.  of the month for coverage to begin on the 1.  of the following month. Open enrollment continues until March 31.. Bataille said the date change was done “in consultation with” insurers.. Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for . , a trade group, said the deadline extension “makes it more challenging to process enrollments in time for coverage to begin on Jan. 1. Ultimately, it will depend on how many people enroll in those last few days.  It is also important to keep in mind that consumers need to pay their first month’s premium before their coverage can begin.”. Consumers have until Dec. 31 to pay for health insurance that begins Jan. 1, Bataille said.. Jeffrey Zients, the former Obama budget official who is overseeing repairs to healthcare.gov, stood by the pledge he made late last month that for most visitors, the website would work smoothly by Nov. 30, which is just one week away.. “The system will not work perfectly but it will operate smoothly for the vast majority of users,” he said.. Fixes include a new feature that sends consumers an email notification when spikes in website demand create access issues. Te emails indicate “a better time to come back to the site,” Zients said. By month’s end, he said the site should be able to accommodate up to 50,000 users at any one time — as originally envisioned — and 800,000 each day, he said.. “I think it’s important to keep in mind here that this is not a simple website,” he said. “The system needs to process the millions upon millions of unique circumstances that consumers present. It needs to determine eligibility for hundreds of state and county programs and all their permutations. And it needs to factor in subsidy levels based on family size, income and plan selection.”. To accommodate repair work, healthcare.gov will down for maintenance from 9 p.m. EST on Saturday, Nov. 23 through 9 a.m. EST Sunday, Nov. 24, Bataille said.. Friday’s announcement giving more time for consumers to enroll in health plans follows the administration .  late Thursday that it is pushing back the start of health law’s 2014 enrollment period next year to Nov. 15 from Oct. 15.. “The reason for doing that is to make sure the [insurers] have the benefit of more time to evaluate their experience from this year and take that into account as they determine what would be necessary for their 2015 rates,” Bataille said. The delay also places the enrollment period beyond the 2014 congressional elections.|Sat Nov 23 00:51:39 +0000 2013||RT @Elana_Gordon: feds have extended the health insurance sign-up deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1 by one week: |4.040495727058821e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2013/11/obamacare-deadline-for-jan-1-coverage-extended-one-week/

|Open enrollment season begins Monday for the approximately .  federal workers and their dependents who receive health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or FEHB. The 2010 health law calls for some changes in that coverage. Below are some frequently asked questions and answers about how the measure will impact federal workers’ health insurance.. A: No, you do not have to buy coverage on the marketplace. You can stay with FEHB. But if you want to shop for a health plan on the exchange, you will not qualify for a subsidy because the federal government pays .  of the cost of your FEHB coverage. . A: Yes. A provision of the health law, originally authored by  Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, requires that, if you are a member of Congress  or work on a lawmaker’s personal staff, you must obtain your health coverage through the online insurance marketplace. And, according to a recent .  from the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, whether or not you are employed in the D.C. Metro area,  you must purchase coverage on the District of Columbia small business exchange. . “Given the location of Congress in the District of Columbia, OPM has determined that the D.C. SHOP (Small Business Health Options Program) … administered by the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority, is the appropriate SHOP from which members of Congress and designed congressional staff will purchase health insurance in order to receive a government contribution,” the rule states.. For the 2014 plan year, members of Congress and their designated staffs must pick from options in the DC SHOP’s “gold” level of coverage, .  The enrollment period coincides with FEHB open season, which runs from Nov. 11 to Dec. 9. Coverage will be effective Jan. 1, 2014. The DC SHOP offers several health plans with nationwide coverage. . A member of Congress or a designated staff member could decline the contribution if they wish.. Since some Capitol Hill staffers split their time between working on a committee staff and a member’s personal staff, OPM asked lawmakers to decide by October 31 which aides are designated as personal staff.   . A: If you meet the congressional rules for retirement and retire before Jan. 1, 2014, you will never go into the exchange. If you do go into the exchange and then retire, you will have FEHB coverage in retirement. . A: During the recent debate over how to end the federal government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., pushed .  that would have required members of Congress, their staffs, the president and vice president, and political appointees to purchase coverage on the exchange without the federal government subsidy. Vitter has said he will continue to push for the amendment. And he has a separate bill that would require members of Congress to make public which staff members they .  from the exchanges. . Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., proposed similar  .  in the House, but her bill would not take away the federal contribution for Capitol Hill staff. |Mon Nov 11 16:53:01 +0000 2013||FAQ: How The Health Law Impacts Federal Employees Health Benefits |3.999428546569216e+17|http://bit.ly/17qgBDX
|Finding out how much an X-ray costs sounds like a simple question. But it is actually very difficult to get an answer. In Massachusetts, a .  requires insurers to be able to tell members how much a test, treatment or surgery will cost. . But while the new law pulls back the curtain on prices of health procedures to some degree, the burden is still on the patient to ask for information. And, as a recent test drive of the new law showed, there are quite a few hoops for patients to jump through. . I threw out my back in September playing squash and went to the doctor. She sent me down the hall for X-rays. I may need more. I’m curious about what my costs will be, so I call my insurer, Blue Cross.. The recorded menu option doesn’t mention health care prices, so I press zero, for all other inquiries.. Eventually, I connect with Jamie D. (customer service reps at Blue Cross don’t give their last names). I explain that I’d like to compare the price of lower back X-rays at a few facilities.. She starts in with the questions: What’s the doctor’s name? What’s the facility where I want to have the X-ray? I have the doctor’s name and facility, but I’m stuck on the next question. Blue Cross wants the procedure codes for each X-ray I may need, my doctor’s national ID number and the name, address and ID number for my hospital or lab, so it can consolidate all the charges into one estimate.. Jamie directs me to a form online. I call my doctor and get the info. If I want to compare prices, I’ll have to fill out separate forms for each X-ray lab. Then Blue Cross has 48 hours to get me an estimate. It takes me 20 minutes to fill out the form, so I only fill out one.. This doesn’t feel very much like shopping. The point of this new requirement is to help patients make smarter choices so that they start behaving more like consumers of health care. Insurers aren’t thinking that way. They all sound a little overwhelmed by trying to put a price tag on medical care. . “Health care is very complex and so it’s difficult to make things simple, straightforward and precise,” says Derek Abruzzese, the vice president for strategy and product development at . .. So many things can change when patients go in for treatment, explains . , director of member decision support at Blue Cross.. “You know, they needed an extra lab, an extra MRI or some sort of diagnostic that we, nor the member or the provider for that matter, couldn’t have foreseen at the time that estimate was requested,” Gerlach explains.. Insurers are also worried about getting the price right because the new state law puts insurers on the hook if they are wrong. Sue Amsel is working on a shopping tool that insurer .  is developing.. “If we show an estimate that is lower and someone goes and pays more, then we are liable,” she says.. She shows me a demo that ends up revealing the range of costs for a brain MRI is between $372 to $1,223.. Amsel says that kind of range is not unusual, which is one reason it’s important for people to know how much health care costs.. “We know that people are frustrated,” Amsel says. “They go to the doctor not knowing, they come back with a big bill that they didn’t expect, they weren’t able to plan for it, they weren’t able to prepare for it. So I think this will help them quite a bit.”. Harvard Pilgrim will spell out what’s included and what’s not in its estimate. I went back and forth several times with my insurer, Blue Cross, and then it took two days to find out my X-ray would cost $147. So we in Massachusetts .  find out in advance, how much everything from a blood test to open heart surgery costs. But in these early days at least, it isn’t quick or easy.. .|Mon Nov 11 16:52:22 +0000 2013||RT @charlesornstein: Exercise in frustration. How Much Is That X-Ray?

|They’ve got a few weeks.. But if federal officials can’t get the new online insurance marketplace running smoothly by mid-November, the problems plaguing the three-week-old website could become a far bigger threat to the success of the health law, hampering enrollment and fueling opponents’ calls to delay implementation, say analysts.. “The system needs to be operating reasonably efficiently – I’m not saying flawlessly – before the middle of November,” said Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger of Kansas, one of the 36 states relying on the federal marketplace because legislators opted not to do their own state-based market.. On Monday, President Barack Obama addressed the problems directly for the first time, saying “no one is more frustrated than me” and promising that technology experts from around the country were working with the administration “to get this working better, faster, sooner.”. Still, he did not offer details about the scope of the problems, a timeline for the repairs or .  who have successfully enrolled out of the more than 19 million site visitors.. The stakes are huge – not just because of public opinion, but practically, in terms of creating the .  which are key to the law’s success. The marketplaces are supposed to be one-stop shops where individual consumers could compare policies, find out if they are eligible for subsidies, and enroll in coverage.  But without robust participation – and the government is counting on 7 million enrollees the first year — the program could fall short of attracting the necessary numbers and balance between healthy and unhealthy consumers, potentially resulting in premium hikes in future years.. “If we’re not seeing a substantial improvement in next two or three weeks, we’ll be in a bad place,” said Dan Schuyler, an exchange expert at Leavitt Partners consulting firm. “We’re already behind the curve in getting to that 7 million mark.”. The risk in frustrating consumers is that those who are healthy or on the fence about enrolling may give up, leaving the unhealthy to persevere and enroll, which could drive up premiums in future years, potentially leading to what experts call “a death spiral,” where only the sickest people sign on.  . “The people who will go back will be precisely the ones who need health insurance because they’ve got ongoing problems,” said Joe Antos, economist at the American Enterprise Institute.. Experts outside the government debate the scope of the problems with little information coming from the Obama administration. What is known is that bugs have made it difficult, if not impossible for consumers to create accounts and have also resulted in insurers getting misinformation about those who do manage to enroll. The troubles have been most severe with the federal website, although a few of the 14 states operating state exchanges are also experiencing serious problems.. If the administration solves the problems before the end of October, “this would just be a blip on the radar,” said Dan Mendelson of consulting firm Avalere Health in Washington.. If problems cannot be resolved that quickly, Mendelson said “there are other options for getting people enrolled,” noting that Medicare beneficiaries signed up for coverage for decades without using computers.. The president also mentioned those options Monday, saying consumers could sign up by telephone, in person with trained assisters or by downloading an application and mailing it in.  . But those options are not ideal, mainly because millions of applications would have to be manually checked across several federal agencies. . “That would take significantly longer than if it was automated,” said Schuyler. “While it’s a fallback, it’s not going to resolve the issue that if Healthcare.gov doesn’t improve in two or three weeks, we’re going to have this backlog of people who are trying to enroll.”. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to enroll for coverage that starts Jan. 1, although the open enrollment period goes to March 31. . Some analysts suggest that if problems persist into late November or December, that the Obama administration will need to consider .  period. . Such a decision, however, would have political and financial ramifications.. Republicans are already seizing on the troubles as a way to advance their effort to delay or eliminate the law, and may obstruct changes that require congressional approval.  . Insurers may not support a longer enrollment either, said Antos. That’s because a later deadline means more time without premium revenue coming in from potential healthy customers while costs mount from providing care to sick customers, who probably signed up before Jan. 1, he said.. Extending the enrollment period could also lead to a domino effect, bolstering efforts by Republicans and other critics of the law to delay the fine for those who fail to sign up for coverage.  With some exceptions, nearly all Americans are required to have insurance next year, or they face a penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their household income. . In addition, it could hurt public perception of the law and of the federal government, said Geoffrey Joyce, director of health policy at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC.. “From a political standpoint, it just shows that this is not working well and it gives fuel to the opposition,” he said. “It doesn’t build confidence that these people know what they are doing.”. Others, however, are less concerned about a slow start. “The law would not reach its target of insuring as many people as possible,” said Carter Price, a mathematician at the Rand Corporation. “But [the federal government] will get a second chance the next year if things don’t go off as planned the first year.” . Greg Mellowe, policy director of consumer group Florida Chain, said that while the troubled website makes it more difficult for groups doing outreach and education, “most people understand that problems with technology are to be expected early on in an initiative of this magnitude.” . Because the health law is primarily aimed at low to moderate income people – and their household cash flow is often drained by holiday gift spending and replenished by February tax refunds — getting the exchange working by November isn’t critical, said Brian Haile, senior vice president of healthcare policy at Jackson Hewitt tax service.. “If you’re trying to sell something you need to do it at a period during which you don’t have competing consumption,” said Haile. “After Nov. 1 … foremost on their minds is not, ‘Am I going to buy insurance?’ but ‘What am I going to put under the tree?’ ”|Mon Oct 21 21:07:49 +0000 2013||RT @Julie_appleby: Only a few weeks to fix the website problems before it really gets troublesome, experts say |3.9239683079510426e+17|http://ow.ly/q2ewS

|Consumers shopping in the new health insurance marketplaces will face a bewildering array of competing plans in some counties and sparse options in other places, with people in some areas of the country having to pay much more for the identical level of coverage than consumers elsewhere.. A Kaiser Health News analysis of the .  found wide variations of price and availability. For instance, Cigna is offering 50-year-olds one of its midlevel plans for $614 if they live in Flagstaff, Ariz. That same plan, contracting with different hospitals and doctors, will cost $428 in Phoenix and just $395 in Nashville. . These are plans being sold in the 34 states where the Department of Health and Human Services is running the marketplaces or working in partnership with the states. Most plans fall into two types: 806 are health maintenance organizations (HMO) plans, in which patients have to stay within the network of doctors and hospitals that have contracts with the insurer, while 714 plans are preferred-provider organizations, where the insurer has discounted rates with some doctors and hospitals and agrees to pay some portion of the cost if the patient goes to a provider that is out of that network. . All the plans take effect in January, although consumers can shop and sign up before then. They are designed for people who don’t get health coverage through their employer or through a government program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. . Policies are grouped into four tiers of coverage – platinum, gold, silver and bronze – to help buyers compare policies. Policies in tiers named for less valuable metals generally have lower premiums. But the trade-off is insurers pick up less of the costs of medical care than they do in the higher metal tiers. People earning below 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $46,00 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four) will get subsidies to help pay the cost of the insurance. . The KHN analysis of premium rate data released by federal officials focused on plans that are offered to consumers of any age and excluded 23 child-only plans and 186 catastrophic plans that pay for most expenses only after the beneficiary satisfies a large deductible. . Insurers offered 158 plans in eastern Florida’s Seminole County, the most available in any single county, and 50 or more plans in 217 other counties across the country. On the other end of the spectrum, shoppers in 161 counties will have 10 or fewer plans to choose from. In sparsely populated Florence County, on the northern border of Wisconsin, Molina Healthcare, an HMO that also runs Medicaid plans in a number of states, was the only insurer to offer coverage: two plans. One costs $1,064 a month for a family of 30-year-old parents and two children. The other plan would cost $944 a month for that family. (Families with more children or older parents will pay higher premiums.) . The large number of plans in some places masks the fact that there aren’t that many insurers actually competing. In Miami-Dade County in Florida there are nine insurers selling 137 plans; Florida Blue alone offers 52 of them. Few markets are as competitive as is Miami. Nationwide, 18 percent of counties have only one insurer offering plans and 33 percent of counties have only two insurers competing, the KHN analysis found. . Monthly premiums are just one factor consumers will take into consideration when comparing plans. The data released by the federal government did not detail other crucial components of these plans, including deductibles, co-payments and which doctors and hospitals are in their networks. Consumers will have to turn to the insurers to find some of that information. . The analysis found that the most expensive plan in a county tended to be about double the cheapest plan. In some places it was even more. Policies in Miami-Dade County ranged from a Florida Blue plan that costs 30-year-old parents and two children $1,419 a month and covers 90 percent of average health costs, to CoventryOne’s HMO plan that would cost that same family $550 a month and include a high deductible. . Plans for a 27-year-old in Dallas ranged from $153 to $387 a month. That most expensive plan, sold by Aetna, will help pay some bills if a patient goes out of network. That policy is in the gold category, where the insurer is required to pick up 80 percent of medical costs. The cheapest Dallas plan, sold by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, is an HMO in the bronze category, where it must pay for only 60 percent of medical costs. . The data show that prices vary significantly among policies grouped together in the same coverage tier. In Cook County, Ill., insurers offered 21 plans at the silver level, where insurers pay about 70 percent of the costs. Aetna is selling the most expensive silver plan in Cook County for $1,108 a month for a family, while Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois is selling the cheapest silver plan for $582 a month. . The names insurers have given their plans hint how they hope to get an edge in these marketplaces. CoventryOne is selling “Bronze $10 Copay HMO.” Other plans include the annual deductible amount in their names to help differentiate them from each other.. Other insurers are seeking to tease the plan approach with less jargon-filled names. Molina Healthcare’s plans include “Be Protected,” “Be Prepared,” “Be Saavy,” “Be Aligned” and “Be Connected.” In Arizona, Meritus Mutual Health Partners is offering “Saver Choice Bronze” and “Lifestyle Choice Bronze” for the low-premium plans that require patients to pick up about 40 percent of the costs. Meritus’ most comprehensive plans are named “Smart Choice Gold” and “Clear Choice Gold.”. The premium data include some striking price outliers, especially in Virginia. There, the records say Optima Health’s silver-level premiums for a 27-year-old reach as high as an eye-popping $1,858 a month. Executives with the insurer, owned by hospital system Sentara, say those premiums are misleading because they include coverage for bariatric surgery, an expensive treatment for morbid obesity. Excluding those policies, the average Virginia silver plan was below the national rate. . “At the eleventh hour, the state allowed us to change that to a rider instead of a specific benefit,” said John DeGruttola, senior vice president of sales. Without the rider, the plan costs a 27-year-old $285 a month in those same counties. . Raymond Smithberger, Cigna’s general manager for individual and family plans, said that medical costs can vary regionally because of differences in rates of disease, hospital charges and state-required benefits, among other factors.. “Similar to how the cost of living ranges in different parts of the U.S., so does the cost of health care,” he said. . Excluding the high-priced Virginia plans that covered bariatric surgery coverage, the average premium varied between parts of the country by as much as twofold. The average premium for a 27-year-old in Pierce County in western Wisconsin was $391; in Hidalgo County, Texas, it was $188. . The most expensive silver plan for a 27-year-old comes from Meritus in Arizona, a nonprofit co-op run by members. Its “Meritus Secure Silver PPO” runs $469 a month in some rural counties, according to the government data. . Jean Tkachyk, chief operations officer at Meritus, said the insurer has decided not to actively market those plans in those rural counties because “they would not be competitively priced.” In Phoenix and Tucson, Meritus was able to offer lower premiums because it was easier to get doctors and hospitals to join its network, she said. Meritus will be actively selling its plans there. . The lowest-priced silver plan in the country is in Pittsburgh, Pa., where a Highmark plan that excludes some area doctors and hospitals is being sold for $134 a month for a 27-year-old. Like many insurers, Highmark has created a smaller network to help hold down premiums. The $134 a month plan, for example, uses Highmark’s Community Blue Network, which has 8,000 doctors and 54 hospitals, compared with a broader network of 11,000 doctors and 63 hospitals that Highmark offers in more expensive plans. . Absent from the Blue network is the well-known University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the main rival in the Pittsburgh region to Highmark’s own Allegheny Health Network. Highmark’s selective network “is generally more efficient, high quality and lower cost,” said spokeswoman Kristin Ash. A similar policy with the broader network including UPMC would cost $197 a month, she said. |Mon Oct 07 18:14:13 +0000 2013||RT @jordanrau: ICYMI Here's our look at premium variation in the fed-run marketplaces nee exchanges. |3.8727971197997056e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/October/04/Marketplace-plans-variation-counties-and-nation.aspx

|The health law’s online insurance exchanges were supposed to be a one-stop shop where consumers browsing for coverage could enroll in a private health plan or in Medicaid if they qualified.. But that won’t happen with the federal exchange being relied upon by consumers in 36 states, at least not initially. The federal website won’t be able to communicate with state Medicaid agencies until at least Nov. 1 due to technical issues, federal officials said.. This means if people are found to be eligible for Medicaid today (under current eligibility rules) after entering their personal data on the . they will be directed to their local Medicaid eligibility office where they will have to repeat the process of providing detailed information about their income, residency status and other data.. But people who become eligible for the health law’s expanded Medicaid in January –when 26 states expand coverage for everyone under 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or up to $15,800 a year for an individual — won’t have to resubmit their data or face a delay in coverage, administration officials said.. “Given that coverage does not begin until January 1, this will not cause a delay for consumers,” said a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Newly eligible people won’t have to take any other action and they would hear back from their state Medicaid program before the end of the year, she said.. “It’s a problem, but not an earth-shattering one,” said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. “It’s an extra step or two, and a disappointment … if people were expecting this to really be ‘Travelocity for health care’ on Day One.”. Nine of the 36 states that are using the federal exchange are expanding Medicaid under the law. Still, the publicity around the Affordable Care Act is likely to bring many people to the websites who are eligible for those states’ current Medicaid programs.. Cindy Mann, director of the Center For Medicaid And CHIP Services for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has repeatedly told reporters and advocates that the exchanges would offer a seamless way of applying for coverage.. Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy professor at George Washington University, said the dilemma would be a “big problem” for people looking to enroll in Medicaid at least initially.. The state-run exchanges are connecting people online to their Medicaid agencies, which makes enrollment simpler.. The exchanges will refer people to Medicaid regardless of whether their state has expanded the program under the federal health law.. A spokesman for the Arizona Medicaid program said the agency is advising people who think they might be eligible for the program to apply directly.. On the first day of open enrollment Tuesday, the Connecticut exchange processed 84 applications for Medicaid and 83 for private health plans, a spokesman for Connecticut Medicaid said.|Fri Oct 04 23:08:37 +0000 2013||RT @philgalewitz: Federal Insurance Marketplace Cant Yet Talk To State Medicaid Agencies |3.862666377560146e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2013/10/federal-insurance-marketplace-cant-yet-talk-to-state-medicaid-agencies/

|When buying health insurance, where you live matters. In Pennsylvania and more than a half dozen states, consumers in some cities will pay at least 50 percent more for the same type of coverage than their friends and relatives in other parts of the state.. A 40-year-old in Philadelphia, for instance, will spend $300 a month to buy a mid-level insurance plan in the new Obamacare marketplace — 77 percent more than a 40-year-old in Pittsburgh, where the same type of coverage will cost a more modest $169 a month.  Lower-income people eligible for federal subsidies will spend less.. Consumers in Georgia, Wisconsin, California, Arizona, Missouri and Florida will also see wide variations, ranging from more than a 100-percent cost spread between high- and low-cost regions of Georgia, to 82 percent in Wisconsin and 52 percent in Florida.. Long a fact of life in the world of insurance brokers, rate variations within a single state have been thrown into sharp relief because for the first time, consumers can compare prices for comparable products by logging into the new online marketplaces. Earlier this week, the Obama administration released average premium prices for the policies that will be sold in the 36 states whose markets are being overseen entirely or in part by the federal government.. “Identical people with identical incomes will face very different choice and cost of plans,” said William Custer, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. For instance, a 40-year-old in rural southwest Georgia would pay $481 a month for a midlevel plan – more than double the cost of someone in the eastern portion of the state, where the premium is $238.. And in California, a 27-year-old buying insurance in Los Angeles will pay $209 a month, 56 percent less than his counterpart in in El Centro, near the Mexican border, who will pay $325. Those premiums are for the second lowest cost plan in the “silver” level of coverage and don’t include subsidies, which will bring down the cost for many consumers.. An estimated 7 million people in 2014 are expected to buy coverage through the new markets, which open for enrollment on Tuesday. The majority of states, including Pennsylvania, defaulted to the federal government to operate their marketplaces or are partnering with the federal government. . “They say all politics is local, and insurance and healthcare are local as well,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy group. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.). Insurer competition correlates strongly with lower prices, federal data show: Georgia’s highest-price region, for instance, has only one insurer — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, Custer said. In other parts of the state, different insurers are offering different prices even for the same type of coverage, he said. . Insurers say they set premiums based on expectations about who will enroll: Will newcomers be generally young and healthy or older or sicker? Other factors include what they pay for labor costs and whether they’ve been able to negotiate favorable rates with hospitals, doctors and other medical providers.. Some insurers may price low to attract market share.  Others are creating insurance plans that limit the network of doctors or hospitals to keep premiums low.  Cost-of-living variation also plays a role.. Philadelphia has both the highest costs in Pennsylvania and the highest utilization of medical care, which accounts for much of the higher premiums, said Brian Lobley, senior vice president of marketing and consumer business for Independence Blue Cross, one of the area’s two major insurers.  The insurer does not sell in the Pittsburgh region.. But something else besides Philadephia’s higher costs is at play, said Mark Pauly, professor of health care management at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.. That something is likely market competition between insurers and rival hospital systems, he said.  That dynamic can spur tougher negotiations between insurers and hospitals, which might agree to lower charges.  And regions with competing insurers often see lower premiums.. “There is something of a price war right now” in Pittsburgh between insurer Highmark and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which also has its own insurance plan, said Joel Ario, a managing director with consultant, Manatt Health Solutions, and a former state insurance commissioner. “They’ve got the ideal situation, with competing insurers and competing hospital systems.”. In Philadelphia, by contrast, there are many hospitals and each has market clout.. “They can resist any effort to cut them out of a network or to bargain,”. because insurers believe they must have every hospital in their network or risk losing customers, Pauly said.. Nationally, some of the lower-cost plans are likely to have narrower networks of doctors and hospitals, said Robert Laszewski, a former insurance executive who is now an Alexandria, Va.-based consultant.. “One of the only ways they can vary the price is by their networks,” he said.. That’s because, starting Jan. 1, the law bars insurers from rejecting applicants based on their health, or from charging the sick more than the healthy.  They can, however, vary premiums based on age, whether the applicant smokes and where they live.. Because the government data released this week does not name insurers – nor give information on the size of the plans’ doctor and hospital networks – it is difficult to tell whether lower cost plans do indeed have smaller networks.   Some consumer groups fear patients may not have access to a wide enough range of doctors or hospitals in some plans and may have to pay more to see an out-of-network specialist as a result.. Ario says there are good small networks and bad ones. The bad ones are those where insurers simply lop off half their providers based solely on price. The good ones create an integrated network with high quality hospitals and doctors.. “The idea that all narrow networks are designed to focus only on price and produce less choice for consumers is not true,” he said. “Some of the best quality insurers now are integrated systems, which tend to have narrow networks.”. Experts say the impact of price variations on enrollment is hard to predict.. “That’s the question we’re all asking ourselves,” said Michael Campbell, director of the Interdisciplinary Health Law Clinic at Villanova University School of law, just outside Philadelphia. “But I don’t see people hopping on the bus and relocating to Pittsburgh” to get a better rate.”|Mon Sep 30 16:05:21 +0000 2013||RT @jordanrau: How Much Premium Variation Is There Within Your State?

|Michelle La Voie wants health insurance, but as a single mom making $38,000 a year and supporting two teenagers, she’s not sure she can afford it — even with a subsidy through the federal health law known as Obamacare.. When enrollment in new online insurance markets begins next month, La Voie will likely qualify for a subsidy to buy private insurance, but would still have to pay $191 a month, or about 6 percent of her income toward the premium. She could also face as much as $2,000 in potential out-of-pocket costs for hospital care and prescription drugs, if she needs those things.. “What’s the point of having [a policy] if I can’t afford to use it?” asks the 47-year-old librarian in upstate Franklinville, New York, referring to the co-pays and deductibles that she might incur if she sought treatment.. How consumers judge the affordability of the new health plans remains one of the biggest unknowns on the eve of the rollout of the health law’s insurance marketplaces. Those marketplaces, aimed at people without group coverage, are predicted to sign up 7 million enrollees by the end of next March. Will shoppers regard the plans as a good value?  Will they be able to afford the monthly premiums and other out-of-pocket costs built into most plans?  . The answers are likely to depend on factors such as their age, income, health issues — and perhaps most important, whether they qualify for free or low-cost care through a government program, or for a substantial subsidy to buy private coverage.  . Some may also weigh whether it is simply cheaper to pay the penalty for not having insurance, which is $95 or 1 percent of household income, whichever is greater, rather than buying coverage.. ‘. Experts say that moderate-income Americans like La Voie, who will be eligible for subsidized coverage but who must still pay between 6 to 9.5 percent of their income toward monthly premiums, are likely to have the hardest time affording the policies.  . That’s because the share someone must contribute toward coverage rises with their income,. starting at 2 percent for those earning the least and rising to a maximum of 9.5 percent for those earning as much as 400 percent of the poverty level, or up to $78,000 for a family of three. .  “I live paycheck to paycheck,” La Voie said. “It’s not like I take vacations, go out to eat, or buy lots of clothes … My money goes to rent, gasoline, food, student loans and utility bills almost exclusively. Believe me, there’s not much left over for extras. It’s very depressing.”. While lower-income people face the same pressure, they will get more help from the government. More than half of the uninsured, for instance, are poor enough to qualify for free or low-cost care through Medicaid, if their states expand the program under the law.  Others will qualify for the most generous subsidies to buy private insurance.. When Joan Fiander of Annandale, Virginia, checked what might be available for a close relative making $9.50 an hour and working full-time, for instance, she was gratified to discover the family member would qualify for subsidies that would keep her monthly insurance cost below $50 a month.. “She was very excited, very excited,” Fiander said. “This is the first time in a long time that she’s gotten a break.”. The law also provides lower-income consumers reduced payments for deductibles and copayments for doctor visits or hospital care. But that help ends after household income hits 250 percent of the poverty level.  . After that level, the law caps out-of-pocket payments to a maximum of $6,350 annually for an individual, or $12,700 for a family.. Insurers must provide certain preventive care services for free, such as cancer screenings and some vaccines. And some plans may also offer doctor visits or other services for a small payment without triggering the deductible. But visits to specialists, buying prescription drugs and hospital stays are among the medical services likely to cost more in the form of copayments and deductibles.. For La Voie, who makes less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, the law caps out-of-pocket costs at $2,250 for individuals. (Her children are covered by a public plan so she would be looking at an individual policy.) Additionally, New York caps people in her income range to a $200 annual deductible and $2,000 in out-of-pocket costs.  . Policy experts say that she’s better off buying a plan even if it’s a struggle because she would be covered for a broad range of benefits. They point out the costs would be far less than if she landed in the hospital as a result of a serious illness or accident and was uninsured. . “People without insurance now are either foregoing health care they would otherwise want or need, or are getting health care but racking up debt,” said Sarah Lueck, senior policy analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  . La Voie fits the bill. She has put off treatment for an episodically painful gall bladder problem which she worries could put her in a hospital emergency room. If that happened, she “would have no choice” but to work out a payment plan to cover the treatment.. Nevertheless, she plans to take that chance because paying the fine for not having coverage is more affordable.. “For now, I’m going with the penalty,” she said. “I would love to have insurance but I also want to [be able to] pay for rent and groceries.”|Tue Sep 24 22:06:34 +0000 2013||RT @jordanrau: Outstanding @Julie_appleby story looking at whether new #Obamacare premiums are really affordable. |3.8262714525392486e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/September/25/obamacare-affordability-insurance-costs.aspx

|The health law’s online marketplaces, also known as exchanges, will be open for enrollment Oct. 1.  They will allow individuals and consumers to comparison shop for health insurance, much like they do now online for an airline ticket or a hotel room, and apply for subsidies, if they are eligible.. If done well, proponents say, the marketplaces could make it easier to buy health insurance and possibly lead to lower prices because of increased competition. But, if designed or marketed poorly, the exchanges will not attract healthy people and will instead be left with a higher percentage of sicker people that will cause premiums to rise. . Here are some answers to common questions about the exchanges: . It’s an .  where individuals and small employers will be able to shop for insurance coverage. Enrollment begins Oct. 1 for policies that will go into effect on Jan. 1. The exchanges will also help people find out if they are eligible for .  to help cover the cost of coverage or if they are eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. . Yes. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are .  exchanges and the federal government is setting them up in 27 states. In seven states, federal and state officials are partnering to run the exchanges. You can get information about the exchange at . , which has details on the federal exchanges and links to state-run exchanges..  will be able to purchase coverage on the exchanges. But many workers and their families already have coverage through their jobs, and they will not be likely to buy policies on the exchanges. The marketplaces are primarily aimed at people who are uninsured and those whose employer-based coverage is too costly and/or lacking in benefits.. Most states and the federal marketplace also will offer a Small Business Health Options program, or SHOP exchange,  that will give employees more options than they have now. Initially, these SHOP exchanges will be open only for businesses with 50 or fewer workers. . Immigrants who are in the country illegally will be .  from buying insurance on the exchanges. Legal immigrants are permitted to use the marketplaces and may qualify for subsidies if their income is no more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $46,000 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four.). Even if your employer offers coverage, you can opt to buy a plan on the exchange. However, you may not be eligible for a subsidy unless you make less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level and your employer’s plan covered less than 60 percent of allowed medical expenses or cost more than 9.5 percent of your household income.. Consumers can shop for coverage on or off the exchange. However, subsidies are generally available only for plans sold on the exchange. Also, adults up to the age of 26 have another choice: They often can get coverage through their parents’ health plans.. For someone with a computer, it’s relatively straightforward. You can go online to Healthcare.gov or to your state-run exchange, if there is one, and create an account. Then you would fill out an application and provide information such as household size, location, income and citizenship status. . Then the exchange takes over. It first determines whether the person is eligible for Medicaid; if so, it will refer you there. If not, it will tell you how much of a subsidy you can receive. (These subsidies will be sent directly by the government to the insurer to pay a portion of the premium.) . After that, the exchange will offer a list of health plans and their premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-payments. If a consumer decides to buy one of those plans, in most cases, you will be directed to the insurer’s Web site to make the payment. In some jurisdictions, consumers will make their first premium payment to the exchange and then further monthly payments to the insurer.. You can also fill out paper applications or apply over the phone. The federal and state exchange sites have toll-free numbers where consumers can find information about getting help in person. . Not exactly. Under a .  proposed by the administration in June, consumers will be able to buy an exchange-approved plan – and receive a health law subsidy – from the insurance company itself rather than from the exchange. . No. Medicare is .  of the health insurance exchanges.   As a Medicare beneficiary, you can enroll in the program’s traditional drug coverage or in a Medicare Advantage plan, where Medicare enrollees get coverage through private health insurance plans, on Medicare.gov during the Medicare open season, which begins Oct. 15. . Most federal workers will continue to get their health coverage through the . ) and not be required to purchase coverage through the health law’s marketplaces. Members of Congress and their personal staffs, however, will be required to buy health insurance through the exchanges.  . A proposed rule from the Office of Personnel Management said the government would .  of paying up to 75 percent of the premium, as it does for federal workers enrolled in FEHBP.  Members of Congress and their personal staffs will not be eligible for the health law’s subsidies and will purchase on the exchange in the state where they live, the agency said.. In some ways, but they will be more complex. People will be able to compare policies sold by different companies. Information on the plan benefits will be standardized in an effort to make it easier to compare cost and quality. Plans will be divided into .  – bronze, silver, gold and platinum – varying based on the size of their deductibles, copayments and other consumer cost-sharing.  They will also have to provide personal financial information and citizenship status that will be linked to the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies.. Plans will have to offer a set of .  that include hospital, emergency, maternity and pediatric care as well as coverage for prescription drugs and lab services. Annual cost-sharing — or the amount consumers pay for out-of-pocket for care for medical services and deductibles but not premiums—will be .  at $6,350 for individual policies and $12,700 for family plans in 2014. . The health law provides sliding scale .  to help people pay premiums up to 400 percent of the poverty level, which is currently about $46,000 for an individual and about $94,000 for a family of four.  There’s also help with .  for individuals and families with incomes of up to 250 percent of the poverty level ($28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four).  According to . , subsidies will average $5,290 per person in 2014.

|The federal health law’s individual mandate, one of the key building blocks of the insurance overhaul, remains controversial as the October start date approaches for enrolling in new online marketplaces. Individuals who don’t get insurance through work will shop for insurance on these websites for policies that will take effect in January. . The mandate, which requires most people to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty, .  last year in the Supreme Court but remains under attack by conservatives. In July, the Republican-led House . , although the measure is not likely to get a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate. . Despite all that attention to the mandate, 26 percent of Americans aren’t aware of the requirement or didn’t think the law included it, according to a . .  . Here are some basic questions and answers about the mandate. . A. .  is a provision of the federal health law that requires you, your children and anyone else that you claim as a dependent on your taxes to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty. That coverage can be supplied through your job, public programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, or an individual policy that you purchase. The health law is setting up online health insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges, to help you shop for plans. . A. The mandate is aimed at some of the 57 million people younger than 65 who now do not have insurance. The .  that in 2014 nearly three out of five Americans will have coverage through an employer-provided plan and 12 percent through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, federal-state programs that provide insurance to lower income Americans. If you have insurance in either of those ways, you are not affected. If you are in Medicare, you also . .  .  . A. Yes, the government has . . Individuals who cannot afford coverage because the cost of premiums exceed 8 percent of their household income or those whose household incomes are below the minimum threshold for filing a tax return are exempt. People experiencing certain hardships, including those who would have been . , also are exempt.  . Other exempt groups include prisoners, Native Americans eligible for care through the Indian Health Care service, immigrants who are in the country illegally, people whose religion objects to having insurance coverage, members of a .  and individuals who experience a short coverage gap of less than three consecutive months. .  that in 2016, after the major provisions of the health law are implemented, 24 million people will be exempted from the mandate’s penalties. . A. The health law was designed to extend insurance to nearly all people, including those who have medical conditions that require expensive care and are often denied coverage today. But to pay for their care, insurance companies need to have a large enrollment of consumers, especially young and healthy people who use fewer services. The mandate was adopted to guarantee a broad base. . , the vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning nonprofit that supports the law, says it will be more effective with the mandate than without it. “This individual mandate is to keep premiums low for everyone,” he said, noting that “if you don’t have incentives for everyone to sign up for coverage then only the sick people will enroll which will drive up premiums.”. But others suggest the mandate won’t be effective because the penalties are set so much lower than the cost of coverage. . “The mandate was an attempt to get around the fact that insurance is going to become a lot more expensive for a lot of people even with the subsidies,” said . , an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Antos believes the tax penalty for remaining uninsured is too low and questions the government’s ability to identify those who end up not filing taxes. “I would argue that the individual mandate is largely unenforceable and does not turn out to be this solution to the other problems that raise insurance costs for that particular group of people,” he added. . A. Health coverage provided through a job-based plan (including COBRA or a retirement plan), policies that you bought for yourself or your family, Medicare (and Medicare Advantage), Medicaid, CHIP, some Veterans Administration health programs or TRICARE coverage for members of the military and their dependents will satisfy the mandate. . If you are uninsured or thinking about switching plans, you can shop for coverage through the online marketplaces beginning Oct. 1. These marketplaces will operate in every state and the District of Columbia and will alert people with lower incomes that they are eligible for Medicaid. The marketplaces will also offer tax subsidies to help reduce the cost of premiums if your income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four in 2013) and cost-sharing subsidies that will substantially reduce the deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and total out-of-pocket spending limits for people with incomes up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level ($28,725 for an individual and $58,875 for a family of four in 2013). . Although the law takes effect Jan. 1, the initial enrollment period continues through March 31. Since people are exempted for a short coverage gap – less than three months – individuals that obtain coverage before the end of March will be exempt from the payment for that period. . A. You will not have to report your coverage or exemptions until you file your 2014 income tax return, which won’t be due until April 15, 2015. Insurance providers will also be required to help their clients report their health coverage. The Internal Revenue Service says it will put out details later about how the reporting will work. . If your income is so low that you do not file a tax return, you are exempt from paying the penalty. . A. If you do not have the minimum level of coverage and do not qualify for an exemption, you must pay a penalty to the IRS at the end of the tax year. The penalty for the first year is up to $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of family income, whichever is greater. . The fine, however, increases over time and in 2016 will be as much as $695 per adult and $347 per child (up to $2,085 for a family) or 2.5 percent of family income, whichever is greater. . The amount you owe will be pro-rated to reflect the number of months you were without coverage. .  that 6 million people, about 2 percent of the population, will be assessed a penalty in 2016.. If you are seeking an exemption for incarceration, membership in an Indian tribe or health care sharing ministry, you can apply through the health insurance exchanges or make a claim when you file taxes, according to a final rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If you are claiming economic hardship or a religious exemption, you must get an exemption certificate from the online insurance exchange. If you are claiming that coverage is unaffordable, you are in the United States without proper documentation or have a coverage gap of less than three months, you can make the claim when you file your 2014 taxes in 2015. .  . A. Opponents of the law argued that forcing individuals to buy insurance was unprecedented and could lead to much greater federal intrusions against individual freedoms. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in fact, asked during the arguments on the law if such a provision meant the government could . . Supporters countered that the mandate was part of a long tradition of Congress regulating business trade under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In the suit brought by 26 states, the Supreme Court allowed the mandate to stand because a majority of justices, in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, said it was a tax and Congress has the power to impose taxes. . A. The origins of the individual mandate have been controversial. Many Democrats who support the law suggest it was originally a conservative idea developed in 1989 by the Heritage Foundation’s Stuart Butler to counter liberals’ efforts to establish a single payer system and impose a mandate on employers to provide insurance. Several years afterward, Republicans used the individual mandate in a bill they offered as an alternative to Bill Clinton’s proposal to overhaul health insurance. The mandate also was incorporated as part of the Massachusetts overhaul of health insurance in 2006 under then-Gov. Mitt Romney. . Democrats later adapted the concept and pushed it as part of the congressional debate over the Affordable Care Act, despite President Barack Obama’s initial reluctance to embrace it. Whatever their prior views, most conservatives opposed the health law’s version of the mandate, and Butler made a spirited argument that the current mandate is not what he was endorsing years ago. |Wed Sep 04 14:13:02 +0000 2013||RT @charlesornstein: A good list of Qs and As: How Will The Individual Mandate Work?|3.7526021735922074e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/September/03/FAQ-on-individual-insurance-mandate-ACA.aspx

|Partly blaming the health law, United Parcel Service is set to remove thousands of spouses from its medical plan because they are eligible for coverage elsewhere.. Many analysts downplay the Affordable Care Act’s effect on companies such as UPS, noting that the move is part of a long-term trend of shrinking corporate medical benefits. But the shipping giant repeatedly cites the act to explain the decision, adding fuel to the debate over whether the law erodes traditional employer coverage. . Rising medical costs, “combined with the costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, have made it increasingly difficult to continue providing the same level of health care benefits to our employees at an affordable cost,” UPS said in .  . The company told white-collar workers two months ago that 15,000 working spouses eligible for coverage at their own employers would be excluded from the UPS plan in 2014. The Fortune 100 firm expects the move, which applies to non-union U.S. workers only, to save about $60 million a year, said company spokesman Andy McGowan. . UPS becomes one of the highest-profile employers yet to bar working spouses from the company plan. Many firms already require employees to pay a surcharge for working-spouse medical coverage, but some are taking the next step by declining to include them at all, consultants say. . “They are simply saying to the spouse outright, ‘If you have coverage somewhere else you are not eligible here,’” said Edward Fensholt, a senior vice president at Lockton Cos., a large insurance broker. “We don’t see a lot of that out there, but more than we used to.”. This year 4 percent of large employers .  by consultants Towers Watson excluded spouses if they had similar coverage where they work. Another 8 percent planned such a change for 2014, according to the survey. . “When health-care reform came on the scene a few years ago we definitely saw an uptick in companies wanting to explore a working-spouse provision,” said Steve Noury, national sales director for HMS Employer Solutions, which monitors dependents’ eligibility for corporate benefits. “We have seen [them] over the past two or three years putting those in place.”. The health law requires large employers to cover employees and dependent children but not spouses or domestic partners. . UPS spouses may have difficulty finding similar coverage at their own employers. The $500 in-network family deductible . , for example, is less than the nationwide average of $733, .  the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.). Health coverage for spouses became standard in the 1950s when wives were less likely to work outside the home. The rise of two-income households led, in many cases, to two family health plans, but employers have been slow to address the overlap. . Companies have employed varying tactics to get spouses off their plans. The city of Anacortes, Wash., pays employees a bonus. if spouses get coverage elsewhere, said human resources director Emily Schuh. This year Xerox went the opposite way, charging employees who enroll working spouses a $1,000 annual penalty, which rises to $1,500 next year.  . Spouse and domestic partner coverage at Xerox “is intended primarily for those who do not have their own access to employer provided medical coverage,” said company spokesman Bill McKee. . One large employer in five collects a surcharge on covered spouses who are eligible for insurance at their own workplace, according to the Towers Watson survey. Another 13 percent planned to add such a working spouse penalty next year. . Now employers are mimicking the city of Richmond, Ind., which excluded working spouses from its health plan starting in January, mainly because too many employees were taking them up on their offer.. “We have all these [employers] around us who are not covering working spouses,” said Richmond human resources director Sue Roberson. “You almost have to do it out of self-defense.”. The new plan at UPS, which .  $807 million last year on revenue of $54.1 billion, affects about a quarter of its U.S. workforce. The company is sharing part of the savings with employees, reducing premiums for workers whose spouses leave the plan. . Neither the company nor the Teamsters union would say whether a pending contract for blue-collar workers includes health-coverage changes for working spouses. . To explain the switch, UPS gave workers a memo, obtained by KHN, that repeatedly mentions the health act. . While acknowledging that overall health spending continues to rise, the company also blamed cost increases on the Affordable Care Act’s .  (initially $1 per health plan member, then rising to $2) and an a .  of $63 per member to stabilize new online marketplaces for consumers buying directly from insurers.. Other factors are the act’s ban on annual and lifetime coverage limits and its requirement to cover dependent children up to age 26, UPS said. The law’s mandate for individuals to obtain coverage will nudge employees who previously opted out to enroll, also raising costs, the company said.  . The health law is “one of the reasons that UPS is implementing the changes,” McGowan said.. Advocates of the law argue that its costs are minimal compared with the burden of overall medical-insurance inflation, which the ACA was designed in part to control.. “The notion that those are going to be make-or-break when they are otherwise absorbing 7 to 10 percent a year [in broader health-cost increases] is kind of ridiculous,” said Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who advised the Obama administration on health policy. “Nobody expected the ACA to have a major effect on health costs for large firms.”. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .  that the law’s effect on premiums for large employers would be negligible.. Consultants point to another health law effect, however, that could also give employers a reason to dump spouses. Excluding wives might help keep companies from paying the “Cadillac tax” on high-value plans that takes effect in 2018, analysts said. . Also, women in their childbearing years “are a cost driver,” said Julie Stone, a senior benefits consultant at Towers Watson. “If you have female spouses and you decide not to cover them, you’re going to bring costs down.” . The Obama administration would not respond directly to UPS’s statements but said that employer coverage increased when Massachusetts implemented its own version of the health overhaul.  . “The health care law will make health insurance more affordable, strengthen small businesses and make it easier for employers to provide coverage to their workers,” said Joanne Peters, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.. Stone doesn’t expect widespread exclusion of working spouses until the health act’s public insurance exchanges, scheduled to open in October, mature. Once companies know there’s an alternative for working spouses, they may accelerate the practice, she said. . But first “they’re going to talk about it for a few years,” she said. |Thu Aug 22 17:39:38 +0000 2013||RT @GlennThrush: The Mrs, aka @dwebbKHN, edited the UPS-spouse-ACA story heard round the world.

|"Two years ago, Dorothy Holmes, then 75, was in the cozy pink bathroom of her mobile home getting ready to shower when she fell. It’s the type of accident that’s pervasive among older Americans – and it’s often the very thing that triggers the end of independence. . “I got a big spot on my head, it almost conked me out,” Holmes said in her soft voice.
. 
She heard her husband come down the hall, “and when he turned the corner all I heard was, ‘Oh God, honey, what did you do now?’ After that I don’t know anything cause I passed out,” Holmes recalled. . Holmes spent almost three months in a hospital. Her heart stopped a few times, she had breathing and memory problems, and doctors removed an ulcer as big as a grapefruit. . These days, patients are often transferred from a hospital to a nursing home to recover. But, then, some never leave. . “The only thing I worried about was not getting out,” Holmes says now. She kept asking her husband and one daughter: “‘You’re not going to keep me here are you?’ ” . Holmes worried that her children and her husband wouldn’t be able to handle her ongoing need for care at home in Belchertown, Massachusetts. . “That was before Martha [Napierski] came into it and told us all we could get for help,” Holmes said. . Napierski, a case manager at WestMass Elder Care in Holyoke, Mass., drew up a plan for Holmes’s transition. . “We made sure she had home-delivered meals, personal care, homemaking seven days a week, sheets she needed for her bed and skilled nursing,” Napierski explained. “She also had physical therapy and occupational therapy.” . Napierski says Holmes would not have gone home without this help, buoyed by money the . states for a Medicaid program called . . The program identifies patients, old and young, who’ve been in a nursing home for at least 90 days but don’t really need to be there. Massachusetts is one of 45 states and the District of Columbia in the program, created by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.. The program was supposed to end in 2011, but . as part of the 2010 federal health law, the Affordable Care Act.. Holmes was a relatively easy patient to transition because she had a place to return to and family who could help with her care. In many cases, Napierski starts from scratch. Finding housing for patients who have given up their homes is the hardest part. Then Napierski shops for appliances, some basic furniture, a few plates and cups.. “Even with that expense, it’s definitely a savings to the state and federal government, as opposed to sometimes $9,000 a month for nursing home care,” explained Priscilla Chalmers, Napierski’s boss and director of WestMass Elder Care in Holyoke. “So it is a success from a humane point of view and also from the point of view of a cost savings to the state.”. That may sound logical, but there’s no proof of savings or happier patients yet. The program is off to a . .. Massachusetts had hoped to have more than 1,000 men and women enrolled by now. It has 306. Community agencies are still waiting for final rules for what and how they’ll be paid — what’s covered and which patients will qualify. The state has to establish connections in the program between housing, mental health, transportation and other departments. . “There is a fairly steep learning curve for most programs” across the country, said Carol Irvin, a senior researcher at . , who is evaluating Money Follows the Person. . And resettling patients who are used to life in a nursing home can be hard. . “It’s a very complicated program for a variety of reasons,” said Dr. Julian Harris, the Medicaid director in Massachusetts. “It’s not a process that’s sort of a one size fits all.” . Putting together all the things a patient may need such as a guard dog, the right home care, home renovations or rides to appointments, is challenging, according to Harris. . But, he added, “this administration has really made a commitment to making home and community based services possible.” . The commitment goes back to a 1999 Supreme Court decision in .  It said that state Medicaid programs have to pay for home care as long as it doesn’t cost more than a nursing home or some other institution. . It will be several years before supporters of this program will be able to say if it saves Medicaid money and whether participants are better off. But Dorothy Holmes is sure – she’s really glad to be back home. . “It just means everything to me,” Holmes said as a new puppy, Jack, jumped onto her lap. “My life is back, almost the way it always was.” . Holmes is frustrated that a leg she injured in her fall is still not strong enough for walking any distance or climbing stairs. She’s fine at home, but she wants to get out more, especially to visit a new great-granddaughter – her fourth great-grandchild."|Fri Aug 16 15:35:32 +0000 2013||The complications of moving home after a nursing home stay: |3.683956109801226e+17|http://ow.ly/21deOq

|Medicare evaluated the readmission rates of 3,379 hospitals in determining the second year of penalties in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. Medicare will apply the penalties to all its payments for patient stays between Oct. 1, 2013, and Sept. 30, 2014.. This chart lists states in the first column. The next three columns show the number of hospitals in each state that received no penalty, the number of hospitals that were penalized and the total number of hospitals. The fifth column calculates the percent of hospitals that are receiving penalties, and the sixth column shows what the average penalty is of those that are getting fined.. Please note: The penalties do not apply to Maryland hospitals, as that state has a unique reimbursement arrangement with Medicare, and thus Maryland is not included in this table.. Data for individual hospitals are available as a .  or a . . .  is also available..

|"Nearly a third of the health systems chosen for the ambitious .  accountable care organization program with Medicare are leaving after the first year of the three-year program. The goal of accountable care is for hospitals and doctors to save money while lowering costs.. The 32 organizations selected to be Pioneers a year and a half ago were considered the best hope for .  The idea was to revolutionize the health system by paying doctors and hospitals for quality rather than volume of service. Pioneers would be offered a bonus for giving patients high quality care at a reduced cost. If they failed to hit certain quality targets or did not manage to reduce the cost of care, they would be dinged accordingly.. By some measures, it worked: The 32 Pioneers generated a gross savings of $87.6 million in 2012. But only .  actually saved enough money to share those savings with Medicare, despite having invested in the programs and staff required to better coordinate care. And two Pioneers ended up owing the Medicare program $4 million.. According to data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services today, all 32 Pioneers succeeded improving quality and performed better than fee-for-service Medicare in 15 quality measures. For the 669,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Pioneer ACOs, spending grew by only 0.3 percent, compared to 0.8 percent in conventional Medicare.. “These results show that successful Pioneer ACOs have reduced costs for Medicare and improved the quality of care for their patients,” said CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. The Pioneers were successful in lowering readmissions rates, improving blood pressure control and improving cholesterol control for diabetes patients, compared to the rest of the Medicare program.. The following nine Pioneers will be leaving the program, according to CMS:. Of these, seven will move into the . , another ACO model with less risk of losing money for the providers. Erik Johnson, vice president of the consulting firm Avalere Health, said, “It’s like going down from the major leagues to the minor leagues. You’re going somewhere it’s just a little bit easier to compete because you don’t have to worry about losing money.”. One of the Pioneers that is dropping out of Medicare’s ACO programs entirely is Presbyterian Healthcare Services in New Mexico. CMS did not identify the other organization that is dropping out.. “We really did learn a lot as a Pioneer ACO,” says Todd Sandman, vice president of strategy at Presbyterian. The decision to leave the program was informed by the data they received from CMS, which showed the health system had not saved money. The biggest problem for the system, he says, was geography — and the fact that there wasn’t much waste to cut. “New Mexico has historically been a low-cost and low-utilization environment” compared to other states, Sandman explains. “So there wasn’t much opportunity to reduce excess utilization and save dollars.”. Chas Roades, chief research officer at the Advisory Board Company in Washington, D.C., says that’s not surprising. The systems selected to be Pioneers were the crème de la crème — hospitals that have already improved the way their care is delivered. “Most of the low hanging fruit is already gone in most cases,” he says, making it harder to further lower costs.. Despite the drop-outs, Roades thinks “the [Pioneer] program is off to a decent start. I’m not hugely surprised that not everyone saved money in the first year.” Part of the problem, says Roades, is that the “year got off to a slightly bumpy start” with some data sharing problems that made it difficult for the hospitals to determine where they might be able to save money. The Pioneers had also . about the quality metrics.. “Going forward, I think we should temper our expectations about how much money we’re as actually going to save through ACOs,” says Roades. ACOs are basically a transitional “hybrid model” that preserves the Medicare fee-for-service system and only applies to a portion of the patients that hospitals see. “It’s really hard to run two disparate sets of books at the same time” and two sets of incentives, he adds.. There are also a slew of different Medicare demonstration projects and private ACOs that these health systems might be part of.  Just because they drop out of the Pioneer program does not mean they’re abandoning the concept.. Presbyterian, for example, is also one of New Mexico’s largest health plans. Sandman says the hospitals have been able to save money in their private insurance product and plans to continue to pursue the ACO model outside of Medicare..

|Dr. Linda Smith walks into a room at Providence Alaska Medical Center, ready with a stethoscope and a huge grin. She teases her patient, Dawn Dillard, saying that her spiky hair recently resembled a “faux hawk.”. Dillard found out she had uterine cancer a year ago. Her oncologist gave her a year to live. The 57-year-old has beaten those odds, but now her kidneys are failing. After the laughs are over, Smith sits down on the edge of Dillard’s bed, leans in, and starts talking about a surgical procedure to help her kidneys.. Smith is a palliative care doctor, a specialty that is .  in the U.S. .  to help patients cope with a terminal or life-altering illness. And unlike hospice care, it is not offered only in the final months of life. Smith works on pain management, coordinating care and even does some counseling. Dillard, who is now in chemotherapy again, really appreciates it.. “I can’t even say how much she’s helped me,” Dillard says. “Just little things. You know, showing me things like breathing techniques. Sort of like mediation, just ways to focus on things that are positive and happy rather than focusing on your sickness and how crappy you feel.”. Two years ago, Linda Smith was a very different kind of doctor.. She worked in the emergency room at the busy Anchorage hospital, where the goal was to quickly stabilize a patient and move on. But two decades into her career, she started to question how she was caring for patients at the very end of their lives. She remembers putting patients on breathing tubes and hearing family members say things like, “I know Dad didn’t want this, but we’re just not ready to let him go.”. “I started to have a lot of regret about doing things to people that were painful and uncomfortable and were prolonging their suffering,” Smith says. She thought, “if I only had the time to sit down with the family, I probably wouldn’t be doing these things.”. In 2011, Smith enrolled in a one-year .  at Providence. She had a lot to learn. She found out she was a bad listener. And she was abrupt. As an ER doctor, sometimes she was so busy she didn’t even sit down to deliver devastating news.. “I can remember saying to families things like, ‘I’m sorry, there’s nothing more I can do.’ And I realize now that sounds like abandonment to many people when you say you can’t do anything more. And the reality is I may not be able to do anything more to the patient that will make them survive, but there’s a lot more that I can do. I always can do more.”. A lot of what Smith does is talk to people. She doesn’t advocate for or against treatment, but she wants patients and their families to understand their decisions.. If a doctor puts in a breathing tube, for example, that may extend a patient’s life, but they won’t be able to eat or talk. If they die with a tube in, the family will miss hearing their last words. So now Smith sits down for hard conversations and looks patients and their family members right in the eye. Earlier this year, she was called in to consult with the wife of a patient who was dying.. “When I entered the room,” Smith says, “The wife said to me, ‘I know who you are.’ And I said, ‘Oh. OK.’ And she said, ‘I don’t want to talk with you and I don’t want to like you because you’re here to talk about death and dying, aren’t you?'”. Smith had a short conversation with the woman, and left her a book on difficult end of life choices. She went back to visit her the next day.. “And she said, ‘You know, I so tried not to like you. And what you had to say. And I really realize that we need to have this discussion now, don’t we?’. “And I said, ‘When you’re ready, we’re ready to have that discussion.’ And she said, ‘I’m ready now,'” Smith recalls.. There’s a shortage of doctors who provide palliative care, and the .  as baby boomers slide towards old age.. Smith was planning to go back to the emergency room. But interactions like that one persuaded her to stay in palliative care. Now she works more and makes less money. Some days, she wonders if she’s crazy..

|The Obama administration Tuesday .  a one-year delay in the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees offer coverage to their workers or pay a penalty.. Administration officials said the delay was in response to employers’ concerns about the law’s reporting requirements. Delaying the law’s “. ” provision would give employers more time to comply and give the government more time to consider ways to “simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law,” according to a blog post from Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for tax policy at the Department of Treasury.. Most of the employers impacted by the delay already offer coverage to workers, Mazur said. He added that the announcement did not delay the Oct. 1 scheduled start of the online marketplaces, or exchanges, or the subsidies intended to help individuals with low to middle incomes purchase coverage or the requirement that most individuals purchase coverage or pay a fine.. It’s unclear what effect the announcement will have on the health law’s goal of providing coverage to millions of American who do not now have it. Although many large employers do provide insurance, the benefits packages vary widely. Workers whose employers do not offer coverage, and now have an additional year to do so, will be forced to go to the exchanges to get coverage.. Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, which has supported the health law, said he didn’t think the change would have a major impact on expanding health coverage, noting that 94 percent of employers with more than 50 workers offer health insurance. But he did say the decision could delay some employers’ decision to start offering coverage or upgrading it to meet minimum benefits of the law. “The decision, I think, will result in some people not getting coverage who would have received coverage if the employer responsibility provision had not been delayed.”. Employer groups were pleased.. “This one year delay will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment,” . , the vice president and employee benefits policy counsel for the National Retail Federation, said in a statement.. Randy Johnson, a senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, took a similar tack: “The administration has finally recognized the obvious – employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate. The Chamber has testified numerous times about the problems with the mandate, and we applaud the administration’s step to delay this provision. We will continue to work to alleviate this and other problems with ObamaCare.”. The National Federation of Independent Business, which unsuccessfully sued to overturn the health law, praised the announcement. . In a statement, Amanda Austin, the group’s director of federal public policy, said the move “is simply the latest evidence that implementation of this terrible law is going to be difficult if not impossible, and the burden is going to fall on the people who create American jobs.” . Democratic lawmakers and some of the law’s strongest advocates were slow to respond but Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in a statement, “Flexibility is a good thing. Both the administration and Senate Democrats have shown — and continue to show — a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is as beneficial as possible to all involved. It is better to do this right than fast.”. But Republicans pounced on it, declaring it further evidence that the law will cost jobs and increase health care costs.. “This announcement means even the Obama administration knows the ‘train wreck’ will only get worse,” .  House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. “This is a clear acknowledgment that the law is unworkable, and it underscores the need to repeal the law and replace it with effective, patient-centered reforms.”. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, noted that the delay takes the issue past the 2014 congressional elections.  Hatch also said the fact that the administration was not also giving individuals or families a one-year extension from coverage requirements “shows how deeply flawed the President’s signature domestic policy achievement is.”. In a White House . , Valerie B. Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said the delay would give employers time to test the new reporting systems and make any necessary  adjustments to health benefits. She said the administration has changed implementation details before, noting that it previously decided to simplify its original .  from 21 to three pages.|Wed Jul 03 01:06:50 +0000 2013||RT Concern about reporting requirements led to delay in mandate that firms provide health insurance or pay penalty. |3.5223193025263616e+17|http://bit.ly/15eDFBz

|Christine Porter is hooked on the My Fitness Pal app. In October, after deciding to lose 50 pounds, Porter started typing in everything she eats, drinks and any exercise she gets.. “This is like my main page here,” says Porter, who lost 42 pounds in nine months. “It’s telling me I have about 1,200 calories remaining for the day. When I want to record something I just click the ‘add to diary’ button. I’m on it all day either through my phone or through the computer.”. Health apps such as My Fitness Pal are turning smartphones and tablets into exercise aides, blood pressure monitors and devices that transmit an EKG. And the day is not far off when doctors may be suggesting apps along with prescribing drugs to help patients manage their health. But the .  is way ahead of tests to determine which ones work. . Porter heard about the app from Ryan Sherman, her health coach at .  of Massachusetts General Hospital. Sherman helps clients turn a doctor’s orders into a user friendly action plan for keeping high blood pressure or sugar levels in check.. Increasingly, says Sherman, patients with diabetes or heart problems are coming in, pulling out their phones, and saying hey, have you seen this app? . “There’s a new one every day, so it’s trying to keep up with that,” Sherman says.. Which is one reason why many doctors are suggesting, but not prescribing apps. Doctors aren’t sure which of the roughly 40,000 available apps do what they claim to do. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration divides health apps into two categories: those that help with healthy lifestyles and those that turn your phone into a medical device to, say, record blood pressure or an EKG, and then send those readings to a doctor. . The FDA is revising regulations for . . It does not plan to regulate diet or exercise apps. A few private companies are stepping in to do that task. Ben Chodor started Happtique, a company that reviews apps and gives those are at least perform correctly, a seal of approval.. “It’s the Wild West and someone needs to come in and at least help the consumers and the clinicians and the payers sort through the 40,000-plus apps that are already out there,” says Chodor.. Happtique will not say which apps work better than others or guarantee their safety. Still, some doctors say apps that work are transforming medicine. Dr. Eric Topol, the chief academic officer at Scripps Health in San Diego, says apps that monitor blood pressure or glucose rates can be more valuable than prescriptions to keep these conditions in check. . “When we use a medication we don’t know if it’s going to work or not.  It’s much better when a person’s taking their blood pressure on a frequent basis,” says Topol. . Some apps work with another device, such as when a person wears a blood pressure monitor tha transmits the data to the person’s phone. “The average person looks at their smart phone 150 times a day,” says Topol. “All of a sudden, they’re able to diagnose if their blood pressure’s adequately controlled and what are the circumstances when it’s not.”. Topol says apps that control blood pressure will help prevent strokes and heart attacks and may mean doctors should prescribe phones and tablets in addition to apps. But Dr. Laura Ferris at the University of Pittsburgh, urges patients to use apps cautiously.. “It does make sense that people who download these apps and use them really understand that they are doing so at their own risk,” says Ferris.. Ferris .  that claim to detect cancer based on a picture of a mole. Only one of the apps sends the  picture of your suspicious mole to a dermatologist. It was right 98 percent of the time. . Three others, says Ferris, could be dangerously wrong: “The best of them missed melanoma 30 percent of the time. The worst of them missed melanoma over 90 percent of the time.”. Despite the growing interest in medical apps, there are many unresolved questions about their use: Should all the information patients collect become part of their medical record and how? Who in the doctor’s office analyzes patients’ numbers? Will insurers cover the cost of apps? . Dr. Ben Crocker, at the Mass General clinic that is testing a few apps, says those are questions doctors will have to answer. . “This is what’s engaging patients,” says Crocker. “Patients are coming to their doc for the first time saying, ‘I’ve been collecting some information or I’ve been using this application.’  And that, I think we can’t ignore no matter where this is taking us, no matter how Wild West it feels.”|Fri Jun 21 15:20:31 +0000 2013||RT @TEDMED: RT @EdelmanHealthDC Could docs soon prescribe apps? @mbebinger for @KHNews thinks they might: |3.480981119331246e+17|http://bit.ly/17WthBA

|Testing of computer systems and training of consumer assistance guides are behind schedule, but the Obama administration has met other deadlines in its efforts to open new marketplaces where millions of consumers might shop for insurance starting this fall, according to a Government Accountability Office .  released Wednesday. . The federal government expects to operate these marketplaces, also called exchanges, in 34 states that opted not to run their own. Seven of those states are working as partners with the federal government. The other 16 states are setting up marketplaces on their own with federal funding.. The report said that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, “has many key activities remaining to be completed,” including those that deal with eligibility and enrollment in the exchanges,  development and implementation of a “data hub” that will connect the exchanges with other federal and state agencies to determine applicants’ eligibility, and review and certification of the health insurance plans offered to consumers.. “Much remains to be accomplished within a relatively short amount of time” for the exchanges to work properly on Oct. 1, the GAO said. The “still unknown and evolving scope” of activities that CMS must provide in states that have chosen not to participate is problematic, investigators said, as are the “large number of activities remaining to be performed – some close to the start of enrollment.”. While the deadlines missed so far may not affect the law’s implementation, “additional missed deadlines closer to the start of enrollment could do so,” GAO found.. In a response included in the report, the Department of Health and Human Services said the agency has made progress in establishing exchanges and that the exchanges would be up and running in all states by Oct. 1.. Opponents of the health law said the report proves the measure won’t work as intended and that Americans will suffer.  “News of delays and missed deadlines are now just as prevalent as reports of Obamacare’s broken promises and the looming rate shock in store for millions of Americans,” House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said in a statement.. Upton, along with Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who chairs the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, requested the study.. The GAO reports that CMS is behind schedule on consumer assistance activities to the states with federal exchanges. For example, CMS was two months late in announcing funds to “navigators” – community organizations and nonprofits that will hire and train people to help consumers sign up for health insurance. CMS had planned to issue the funding announcement in February, allowing enough time for two rounds of awards in July and September. Instead, the agency did not announce the grants until April, leaving time for only one round of awards, which is expected on Aug. 15.  . The navigator grants will . for the federally run marketplaces  – “a drop in the bucket,” according to Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. Some states received as little as $600,000.  That’s far less than states running their own marketplaces. California, for example, is spending $50 million to fund in-person help for consumers.. All navigators are expected to complete a web-based training and certification course. CMS had expected to begin training by July, but the course may not be ready until August. . Nonetheless, CMS officials indicated that the navigators would  be available by Oct. 1, when enrollment for 2014 plans begins, according to the GAO report. . Insurers that want to sell health coverage on the exchanges had to apply by May 3, and CMS, along with help from a  contractor, expects to evaluate and certify those plans by July 31, according to the GAO report. Information about those plans is expected to be available on the exchange website by Sept. 15. . The GAO analysis also took a close look at the status of the complicated technology that will be needed for the exchanges. GAO said that some limited testing has begun of the information technology systems needed to determine whether consumers seeking coverage in the marketplaces are eligible for federal subsidies and to enroll them in health coverage. But it noted that much more needs to be done before October.. “While CMS has met project schedules, several critical tasks, such as final testing with federal and state partners, remain to be completed,” the report said.. Critics said the report shows that CMS and other agencies are falling behind, but others said the conclusion was that much progress has been made.. “It is the GAO’s job to outline problems that could occur,” said Dan Mendelson of the private consulting firm Avalere Health, but the report’s conclusions are “getting spun through this lens of political discontent, so as a result, everyone is freaking out about it.”. States, he said, are rightly concerned that delays in the income and eligibility information technology might not operate efficiently at first.. “That would force them to do manual enrollment – get on the phone with people – and that’s expensive,” said Mendelson, who oversaw health programs at the Office of Management and Budget during the Clinton administration. . Mark McClellan, who was in charge of the rollout of the Medicare drug benefit in 2006 for the George W. Bush administration, said testing of some IT systems for that project began not long after the law was passed in 2003. But, he said, work continued right up to and even after the program began. That rollout was initially marked by glitches that included enrollment problems, and some seniors who qualified for subsidized coverage were mistakenly told they didn’t have it when they showed up at pharmacy counters.. “You are limited in what you can test ahead of time,” said McClellan. Once real data starts flowing through a system, unexpected problems crop up because real data is always messier than test data sets, he said.. While the Obama administration still has time to get the testing done,  McClellan said, he cautioned that “it is tight.”. The GAO report also states that CMS has spent $394 million from fiscal year 2010 through March 31 of this year on various activities to get the federal funded exchanges established and . . CMS officials said the totals did not include agency salaries or other administrative costs. . The report on the federal insurance marketplaces was one of two on health law implementation released by GAO Wednesday. The .  looked at federal and state efforts to establish the Small Business Health Options Programs (SHOPS) in which small employers can buy coverage for their workers. In that report, GAO found that “CMS and states have made progress in establishing SHOPS, although many activities remain to be completed and some were behind schedule.”|Thu Jun 20 12:49:53 +0000 2013||GAO Report Points To Challenges In Setting Up Federal Health Insurance Marketplaces |3.476978134313984e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/June/19/GAO-report-on-federal-health-exchange-implementation.aspx

|"A new study suggests that cash-strapped Medicare missed an opportunity to save more than $1 billion by not addressing the varying costs and use of prescription drugs.. Comparing Medicare enrollees and those on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health plan, researchers found that Medicare beneficiaries were up to three times more likely than VA patients to choose higher-cost brand name drugs over generic brands, . .. “The main issue, and the only way to fix this, is to change what physicians are doing,” said Dr. Walid Gellad, a lead author and internist with the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System and the University of Pittsburgh.. Physicians in the VA system follow an approval process that requires them to try the generic drug before they prescribe a patient the brand-named version. The system also limits their providers’ interactions with pharmaceutical representatives, which Gellad said can alter the way a doctor chooses to prescribe certain drugs.. Researchers compared diabetic patients of similar ages – about 75 years old – and health outcomes. They calculated that if Medicare Part D followed the VA system, drug spending would have been $1.4 billion less in 2008. If the VA had adopted Medicare practices, on the other hand, its spending would increase by $108 million.. The findings echo a larger conversation among policymakers about pharmaceutical costs, since brand-named versions can cost significantly more than their generic counterpart. Both nonprofit patient assistance programs, like . , and government legislation, like the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, have sought to tackle the high costs of prescription drugs and physicians’ prescribing practices.. “There is not too much transparency when it comes to drug pricing,” said David Lipschutz, an attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. “People focus on out-of-pocket expenses.”. He pointed out that lawmakers have offered many proposals to deal with prescription drugs, with different methods to control the costs through both market competition and changes in the patient’s copay.. Lipschutz said the new study would help inform a debate, even if data was culled from two “very different systems with big structural differences.”. Meanwhile, Gellad called the results of his study “startling” and said he hopes it will spur action as lawmakers seek ways to slow Medicare spending.. “It’s an easy solution,” he said. “You don’t have to change a law or do anything special to decrease costs – you just have to change the kind of drugs people are using.”.

|The federal health law derided as a “job-killer” by critics will create an estimated 9,000 jobs in 14 states this summer to handle consumer inquiries about new online insurance marketplaces.. The jobs are through Vangent, a General Dynamics subsidiary, which was awarded a $530 million one-year contract by the federal government to set up call centers to answer inquriers related to the insurance marketplaces in 34 states where they will be run in whole or part by the federal government. Other states will run their own marketplaces with their own call centers.. The marketplaces open for enrollment Oct. 1, and are the key way the law expands health coverage to about 27 million people by 2016.. Health and Human Services Department officials did not specify which 14 states would get the jobs.. Vanget was initially awarded a $28.2 million contact —. –but that was only for the first two months.. Under the federal contract awarded to Alexandria, Va.-based Vangent Inc.,  the company will also field inquiries about Medicare, Medicare Advantage and “other relevant programs,” the award announcement stated.. The call center for the new insurance marketplaces is expected to be in operation by June and will be able to field calls every day, 24 hours a day, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.. Vangent, which was bought by General Dynamics in 2011, does work for numerous federal agencies including the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Justice Labor , State, Veterans Affairs and Military Health Systems.  A report which the company filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission in 2010 said that almost half its revenue came from HHS contracts.|Fri May 03 16:56:44 +0000 2013||RT @philgalewitz: Obamacare call centers for Marketplaces to create 9,000 jobs in 14 states |3.3036531701449114e+17|http://bit.ly/17BCSdS

| Last week the Arkansas legislature .  a plan to give Medicaid beneficiaries money to buy individual policies from private insurers on the state’s health insurance exchange — the subsidized, online markeplaces due to be in business next year. The governor signed the bill Tuesday — making it law.. The Department of Health and Human Services, which has said it “. ” of such arrangements, still needs to negotiate details and sign off.. One insurer is already expressing interest.. “We are very capable of doing an Arkansas-type model,” Centene Corp. CEO Michael Neidorff said Tuesday. “That’s something that would be a sweet spot for us.”. Centene sees opportunity in participating in the health law’s coverage expansions, whether Arkansas-style or not. It already runs Medicaid managed care plans for those with very low incomes in several states, although not in Arkansas. Now it wants to offer plans to individuals with slightly higher incomes through the exchanges.. “We believe we can achieve increased profitability in 2014 upon the commencement of the ACA,” Neidorff told stock analysts Tuesday. “The exchange market represents the largest growth opportunity for Centene over the next several years, estimated at $52 billion in our existing markets.”. Policy analysts expect .  from members moving between the ACA’s expanded Medicaid program and commercial policies sold on the exchanges as their incomes fluctuate. Centene wants to be on both sides of the line, selling “a product that offers people a comfortable transition,” said K. Rone Baldwin, chief of the company’s insurance group.. Whether managed by Centene or some other carrier, private, individual insurance in the Arkansas mode could help Medicaid members keep the same doctor and otherwise minimize disruptions when they graduate to a non-Medicaid exchange plan, some have suggested.. The Arkansas model faces large questions. . . Commercial insurance of the type Arkansas sees covering Medicaid members typically pays doctors and hospitals more than traditional Medicaid or Medicaid managed care plans like Centene runs.. But the plan is being praised as a .  to Obamacare classic and is reportedly being eyed by . , .  and other states resisting the Medicaid expansion.. Centene executives spoke to investment analysts on a conference call about the company’s quarterly profits. Like other insurers, they were coy about saying where they plan to offer exchange plans and on what terms.. “We do expect to be on the exchanges in a subset of the places where we have health plans today, and we’re entering into contracts with hospitals,” said Baldwin. How well will Centene be paying those hospitals to care for its exchange members? “It’s certainly not exactly at [lower] Medicaid rates but I wouldn’t say it’s exactly at [higher] commercial rates either,” he added.. The company earned $23 million for the quarter on revenue of $2.5 billion.|Fri Apr 26 21:47:35 +0000 2013||RT @steveforbesceo: Obamacare math: Proposed premiums expected to rise by 25% on average next year.

|"Michael Hebb wants you to pass the butter, and then talk about passing on.. As the founder of .  he urged Americans to engage in a conversation about how they want to die, a conversation that could change the high cost of caring for the terminally ill and grant patients their ultimate requests.. “Our hope is to spark the gentlest revolution imaginable,” he said at the .  on Thursday evening.. Hebb’s talk was part of a session called “Welcoming Death Into Life,” which included talks by an opera singer who had undergone two lung transplants, an ER doctor-turned-engineer, and an anthropologist who studied an Indonesian tribal community that sometimes waits years to have a funeral when someone dies.. , pointed to statistics that show that 75 percent of the population said they wanted to die at home, but only 25 percent did. The audience also murmured in surprise at a slide showing that 43 percent of Medicare recipients spend all of their assets on end-of-life care.. But . , author of .  offered the counterpoint and a window into why end-of-life care is so expensive as she told her story about how difficult it is to allow a family member to die, even when his prognosis is grim.. Bennet’s husband lived for seven years after being diagnosed with kidney cancer, a time span that included close calls, aggressive therapy and remission. She said that she and her husband were an adventurous and strong couple, and the idea that there was no hope never crossed their minds.. “We had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn’t have a heroic narrative for letting go,” she said.. Bennet said that she and her husband had advance directives – a sort of living will for ill patients – and expert advice not to continue his treatment, but there was a combination of denial and optimism that overshadowed decisions during that time.. Hebb said wills and directives should be openly discussed with close friends and family. Coupled with the power of sharing a meal, he said a dialogue about death could lead to a more fulfilling life, if patients were willing to have it.. “We need a patient revolution to change the cost of death,” he said.. And while Bennet said she wouldn’t replace their last seven years together, she realized when her husband died that they had never said goodbye.. “We never got the chance to turn to each other to say, ‘Hey buddy, it’s been a hell of a ride’,” she said..

|Got alarm fatigue?. Some doctors and nurses do, according to . , a nonprofit hospital accrediting organization.. In their . , issued April 8, the commission highlighted the dangers that result when doctors and other health professionals develop “alarm fatigue” or become desensitized and immune to alarm sounds set off by medical devices used for monitoring and treating patients.. According to the commission, between 85 percent and 99 percent of alarm signals do not require clinical intervention. As a consequence, hospital workers may respond by turning the alarms off, reducing their volume or even changing their settings to a level deemed unsafe for patients. Thus, those suffering from alarm fatigue may potentially ignore real emergencies — a circumstance that could have very real implications for patients.. “It’s a problem that’s been identified for a while. And as many problems that exist in health care, it’s a problem that’s complicated, multifactorial and there is no one solution for it,” said . , The Joint Commission’s executive vice president and chief medical officer.. According to the Joint Commission’s sentinel event database, there were reports of 80 deaths and 13 cases in which patients were permanently injured between January 2009 and June 2012 due to alarm-related incidents. Ninety-four percent of these cases occurred in hospitals — mostly in areas like emergency departments and intensive care units. Falls, delays in treatment, ventilator use and medication errors were traced back to alarm system issues, the commission reported.. McKee adds, however, that the commission’s data may only represent a small portion of all actual alarm-system events. A search of the Food and Drug Administration’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, for instance, noted more than .  during a similar period of time from 2005 to 2008.. “Reporting is inconsistent for any event. A lot of things go unrecognized, unnoticed or sometimes there’s a lack of a culture of safety so people don’t want to report it,” she said during an interview. According to McKee, there is no database currently collecting data on accidents related to these alarms. “For those reasons, we can’t be very specific about how big of a problem it is,” she added.. According to Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and patient safety policy at the . , some hospitals have already begun focusing on alarms in intensive care units and other areas where there is a high density of equipment and critically ill patients.  “Improving our management of alarms and our effective use of alarms to really alert the staff to a critical problem is a great step forward for patient safety,” Foster said. She added that manufacturers can also be a part of the solution by making their devices’ alarms and sounds easier to distinguish from other alarms.. “Alarm devices are pretty much everywhere in health care” and the idea “that there’s a problem with an alarm device often goes unrecognized,” McKee said.. The Commission issued the alert, she said, to raise awareness of the issue among hospital leaders with a hope that they will develop new systems to better manage these alarms.|Tue Apr 16 19:29:07 +0000 2013||RT @AlvinHTran: Got alarm fatigue?

|When Corynn Stoltenberg, then 31, found out she was at high risk for cancer at a health fair in Minnesota, she hadn’t been to the doctor in 10 years.. As a dancer and theater artist who supported herself by working at coffee shops and cleaning houses, she often was without health insurance or a steady income. Then Stoltenberg’s friends told her about . , a St. Paul-based program that offers low-cost health care and other resources to freelance artists.. The timing was essential, she said. Stoltenberg’s pelvic exam, one of the free screenings offered at the event, revealed abnormal cells that could have led to cervical cancer if left unchecked.. “Artists are entrepreneurs, but they haven’t always been taught the business side of making a living,” said Nikki Hunt, a spokeswoman for Springboard for the Arts. “And health care is one of the biggest barriers.”. Freelance artists are part of the estimated 15 million people who are currently self-employed, according to a U.S. Department of Labor 2012 estimate. They make up 42 percent of the membership at the . , a fast-growing national organization that provides insurance and benefits for its more than 200,000 members.. In 2014, the union will also offer three consumer-operated and oriented plans (co-ops) in New York, New Jersey and Oregon, using funding from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that was authorized in the health law.. Programs like Springboard and the Freelancers’ Union co-ops help a community that Hunt said is often underinsured because many artists have low incomes — between $12,500 and about $25,000 — especially when they are not yet established.  But that doesn’t always qualify them for government programs like Medicaid, which has varying income and eligibility requirements depending on the state.. Springboard has served 100,000 artists since 1992. It’s Artists’ Access to Healthcare program, which has helped about 5,000 artists in the last five years, partners with community clinics to provide vouchers to access free or low-cost health services, which include dental, medical and mental health care. The organization also holds health fairs, workshops and resources in other regions or cities who want to replicate the program.. “Without programs that sort of put it out there and promote health, we don’t always know where to look,” said Stoltenberg, who is now pursuing a psychology degree at Smith College. She said that before Springboard she had tried to apply for a government health plan but was daunted by the documentation she needed to prove her eligibility.. But she is confident that programs that help artists have a larger reach than their membership.. “When you support artists, you feed the entire community,” she said. “We really need creativity to thrive.”|Mon Apr 15 17:44:38 +0000 2013||Programs help draw artists toward health care access. @anrao reports: |3.2385439146143334e+17|http://bit.ly/YpjriL

|School administrators in Dothan, Ala., aren’t sure whether health act rules taking effect next year will require them to offer medical coverage to substitute teachers, who lack it now. . But they aren’t waiting to find out. The system has decided to hire subs through Kelly Services, a temporary staffing agency, to avoid any health-cost obligations that might come as their direct employer. . The district pays about $700 per month per full-time teacher for medical insurance. “You multiply that times 300 [substitutes] and you’ve got a big expense,” said Dell Goodwin, personnel director for . .. The rush to implement the Affordable Care Act, which is generating billions for insurers, hospitals and technology vendors, also looks like a boon for staffing companies, whose share prices have soared. But some suggest that exceptions for temporary employees could leave holes in the health law’s expanded coverage.. “That could lead to an increase in part-time workers” who lack insurance, said Susan Houseman, an economist at the .  who studies staffing companies. “You regulate something and people will always try to find a way around the regulation.”. Starting in January, employers with at least 50 workers . . Some are considering outsourcing jobs to specialists such as Kelly, Manpower, Robert Half and Randstad to stay under this limit. . “We are already getting inquiries from our client base for companies in and around 50, asking us to help them understand this legislation, and to inquire as to how we might be helpful,” Keith Waddell, Robert Half’s president, told investors on a . . “Our response is that we can legally help them remain under 50.”. The health law is also prompting larger organizations such as Dothan schools to use temp agencies. By requiring employer coverage only for those who put in at least 30 hours a week, the act creates an incentive to do less with permanent workers and more with part-timers, which are staffing agencies’ specialty. . Manpower is talking to clients about “a more flexible labor model” where workers “might be working 29 hours a week,” company CEO Jeffrey Joerres . . “We definitely look at it as positive.”. Manpower and Robert Half declined to make officials available for interviews. . Little-known, complex rules developed by the Internal Revenue Service could allow even some full-time jobs placed through temp agencies to come without health benefits. . Manpower, Robert Half and other staffing specialists are giant companies, with far more than 50 employees. So they are subject to the same health act requirements as everybody else to offer coverage to full-timers.  . But in .  the IRS left an opening for employers of “variable-hour” labor such as temp agencies. If it’s not clear upon hiring that an employee will consistently work more than 30 hours weekly, companies get up to 12 months to determine whether she is full time and qualifies for health benefits — even if she does end up working full time. Few temps last 12 months.. “The overwhelming majority of temporary help workers, even if they were working full-time on a weekly basis for a number of months, wouldn’t be covered because of that 12-month look-back period,” said the Upjohn Institute’s Houseman. The rules, she added, “were written in a very favorable way for the temporary help industry.”. There are good arguments for exempting new, variable-hour workers from health-coverage obligations, she said: tracking who worked 30 hours during which weeks for health-plan eligibility would cause confusion for employers and insurers alike. . The upshot, however, is that most temporary help workers — nearly 3 million on any given day — won’t have employer-sponsored medical coverage even if they’re working more than 30 hours, she said.. Under the health law’s mandate that everybody be insured, temp workers without insurance must pay a penalty or seek coverage in state-based marketplaces known as exchanges. Because of the lower wages typically paid by staffing agencies, temps will likely be eligible for tax credits or Medicaid.  . Kelly CEO Carl Camden downplays the idea that employers will shed health coverage liabilities by hiring staffing companies. He sees clients’ adjustment to the health act as “a modest opportunity” for his company.. “There is a portion of the staffing industry who think there will be a large amount of companies trying to avoid obligations under the ACA and trying to shift over to staffing firms,” Camden said in an interview. “I don’t see that as happening.”. The bigger business may be helping companies navigate the law with consulting or by taking over temporary jobs they already have, say Camden and other industry officials.. “We expect that clients that have those kinds of workers and who are daunted by the complexity of the Affordable Care Act will look to staffing firms to help them manage those kinds of workers,” said Edward Lenz, senior counsel for the . , a temp company trade group.. Staffing company share prices have shot up, partly in response to the recovering economy and partly because of hopes for a surge in Affordable Care Act business, industry analysts say. Manpower has risen by half since November while Kelly, Randstad and Robert Half are all up more than 35 percent, far more than the market as a whole.. A few years ago, when Massachusetts implemented its own requirement that companies provide health coverage to full-time workers, temp jobs increased six times faster than in the country as a whole, said Jeffrey Silber, who follows staffing company stocks for BMO Capital Markets. . The people running Dothan schools see a double benefit. By hiring substitutes through Kelly they’ll avoid possible medical costs and at the same time dodge the complexities of how the health act affects subs, said personnel director Goodwin.. Sometimes subs work more than 30 hours and sometimes they don’t, she said, and keeping track of who would be owed health coverage “would just be a continuing accounting nightmare.”. Several other Alabama systems are hiring subs through Kelly, which has been offering health-law webinars through the state school superintendents association.   . And no wonder, Goodwin said. At last year’s meeting of the American Association of School Personnel Administrators, “that was one of the hottest topics,” she said: “How this Affordable Care Act would affect school systems.”|Tue Mar 26 13:30:12 +0000 2013||RT @jayhancock1: Staffing agency stocks soar as employers see temps as a way around Obamacare coverage requirements.  |3.165426026211041e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/March/26/temporary-employees-health-law-insurance-coverage.aspx

|When visiting the doctor, there may be strength in numbers.. In recent years, a growing number of doctors have begun holding group appointments — seeing up to a dozen patients with similar medical concerns all at once. Advocates of the approach say such visits allow doctors to treat more patients, spend more time with them (even if not one-on-one), increase appointment availability and improve health outcomes.. Some see group appointments as a way to ease looming physician shortages. According to .  in December, meeting the country’s health-care needs will require nearly 52,000 additional primary-care physicians by 2025. More than 8,000 of that total will be needed for the more than 27 million people newly insured under the Affordable Care Act. . “With Obamacare, we’re going to get a lot of previously uninsured people coming into the system, and the question will be ‘How are we going to service these people well?’ ” says . , who has developed group-visit models and consults with providers on their implementation. With that approach, “doctors can be more efficient and patients can have more time with their doctors.” . Some of the most successful shared appointments bring together patients with the same chronic condition, such as diabetes or heart disease. For example, in a diabetes group visit, a doctor might ask everyone to remove their shoes so he can examine their feet for sores or signs of infection, among other things. A typical session lasts up to two hours. In addition to answering questions and examining patients, the doctor often leads a discussion, often assisted by a nurse. . Insurance typically covers a group appointment just as it would an individual appointment; there is no change in the co-pay amount. Insurers generally focus on the level of care provided rather than where it’s provided or how many people are in the room, Noffsinger says. . Some patients say there are advantages to the group setting. “Patients like the diversity of issues discussed,” Noffsinger says. “And they like getting 2 hours with their doctor.” . Patients sign an agreement promising not to disclose what they discuss at the meeting. Although some patients are initially hesitant about the approach, doctors say their shyness generally evaporates quickly. . “We tell people, ‘You don’t have to say anything,’ ” says Edward Shahady, medical director of the .  at the Florida Academy of Family Physicians Foundation in Jacksonville. Shahady trains medical residents and physicians to conduct group visits with diabetes patients. “But give them 10 minutes, and they’re talking about their sex lives.” . Though group appointments may allow doctors to increase the number of patients they see and thereby boost their income, many doctors are uncomfortable with the concept, experts say, because they’re used to taking a more authoritative approach with patients rather than facilitating a discussion with them. . According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, 12.7 percent of family physicians conducted group visits in 2010, up from 5.7 percent in 2005. . Some studies have found that group visits can improve health outcomes. In an Italian trial that randomly assigned more than 800 Type 2 diabetes patients to either group or individual care, the group patients had lower blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol and BMI levels after four years than the patients receiving individual care. . Doctors say patients may learn more from each other than they do from physicians. “Patients really want to hear what others patients are experiencing, ” Shahady says. . Jake Padilla of Westminster, Colo., participated in his first group visit more than a decade ago, shortly after he had heart bypass surgery. . Padilla, now 67, continued to attend group appointments geared to primary-care patients’ concerns for years after that at the Kaiser Permanente outpatient clinic near his home. (Kaiser Health News is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.) He usually went once a month or so, and the members of the group constantly changed.. One woman who attended the group was 102 years old, he remembers. Fellow patients wanted to know how she managed to live that long. One of her secrets, she said, was deep breathing. Padilla has since used that advice when his blood pressure gets out of control. . But group visits aren’t for everyone. Padilla’s wife, Tedi, went to one meeting with him and never went back. . “She said she didn’t have time to sit there and listen to all those patients,” he says. |Tue Mar 19 14:46:21 +0000 2013||RT @anrao: Would you see a doctor with a group of other people? @KHNews  |3.140250510977966e+17|http://bit.ly/YDKbee

|How good a hospital is St. Mary Mercy Livonia Hospital? Depends on whom you ask.. The Leapfrog Group, a respected nonprofit that promotes patient safety, gave an “A” to this Michigan hospital. The company Healthgrades named it one of America’s best 50 hospitals.. But the Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals, and U.S. News and World Report omitted St. Mary from their best hospital lists in 2012. Consumer Reports gave it an average safety score of 47 points out of 100, citing high numbers of readmissions, poor communication with patients and excessive use of scans. Medicare, which has a new program .  for meeting certain quality measures, is reducing St. Mary’s payments by a fraction this year.. Evaluations of hospitals are proliferating, giving patients unprecedented insight into institutions where variations in quality can determine whether they live or die. Many have similar names, such as “. ,” “. ” and “. .” . , .  and other states have created their own report cards. In some places, such as California, there are more than a dozen organizations offering assessments on hospital quality.. But those ratings, each using its own methodology, often come to wildly divergent conclusions, sometimes providing as much confusion as clarity for consumers. Some hospitals rated as outstanding by one group are ignored or panned by another. Ratings results from an individual group can change significantly from year to year.. “We’ve alternatively been labeled the least safe hospital in Maine and the safest hospital in Maine,” said Dr. Douglas Salvador, vice president of quality at Maine Medical Center in Portland.. And the ratings do not always jibe with the views of authorities who oversee hospitals. For instance, UCSF Medical Center has gotten good grades from multiple safety raters even as .  have fined it $425,000 repeatedly for endangering patients.. As ratings multiply, more and more hospitals have something they can boast about. A third of U.S. hospitals—more than 1,600 — last year won at least one distinction from a major rating group or company, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. In the greater Fort Lauderdale hospital market, 21 of 24 hospitals were singled out as exemplary by at least one rating source. In the Baltimore region, 19 out of 22 hospitals won an award.. “I worry a lot about these ratings,” said Jerod Loeb, executive vice president for health care quality evaluation at the Joint Commission. “They’re all justifiable efforts to provide information, but at the end of the day every single one of them is flawed in some respect. Rather than enlightening, we may be confusing.”. There are so many report cards on hospitals that the Informed Patient Institute .  that grades the raters. Carol Cronin, its executive director, said most report cards are not easy for consumers to use. “A lot of them don’t help users quickly understand which hospital is better than another,” she said.. But many hospitals are eager to trump these distinctions in their marketing. Healthgrades, U.S. News and Leapfrog not only encourage this but also profit from it by charging licensing fees to hospitals that want to advertise their awards. “A hospital cannot buy an award, they must achieve it,” Healthgrades said in a statement.. Dr. Andrew Brotman, chief clinical officer at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan, said the fees can be substantial. “Healthgrades, which is one we did well on, charges $145,000 to use this even on the website as a logo, so we don’t do that,” he said. “U.S. News is in the $50,000 range. Leapfrog is $12,500.”. Healthgrades and Truven Health Analytics, which publishes the 100 Top Hospitals, offer consulting services to hospitals that want to improve their overall performances. Jean Chenoweth, a Truven senior vice president, said the list doesn’t earn Truven any money but it “gives the company a lot of visibility.”. Consumer Reports bars hospitals from using its ratings in marketing, but patients must subscribe to read them online. (Others generally provide free access to ratings on their sites.) The Joint Commission does not charge hospitals that make its top quality list.. A .  found 14 percent of Internet users consulted online rankings or reviews of hospitals and medical facilities. Florence Harvey, 70, said when she moved to Washington, D.C., last fall, she picked a health plan and doctor affiliated with Washington Hospital Center after reviewing all the local hospitals rankings on U.S. News’ website. “That was the one that had the best across-the-board ratings,” she said.. But Harvey may be an anomaly. Dr. Peter Lindenauer, a professor with Tufts University School of Medicine based in Springfield, Mass., said the limited research on rankings “suggests they have had very little impact on patient behavior.”. That’s not surprising since many admissions, such as those due to a heart attack or car crash, have an immediacy that rules out comparison shopping. Also, researchers note, many patients defer to their physicians’ recommendations or go to the hospital where their chosen surgeon has privileges. Still, rating groups say the ratings help keep the pressure on hospital executives to keep quality up.. “Patient safety has to be a priority 24-7,” said Leah Binder, Leapfrog’s president. “The minute it slips off the priority list, that impacts the rating.”. The calculations that go into these ratings are complex. Most hospital assessments synthesize dozens of  pieces of data Medicare publishes on its . , including death rates and the results of patient satisfaction surveys. They also examine other sources and use private surveys to create user-friendly lists or grades, which they display on their websites..  looks at how frequently patients received recommended treatments, such as flu shots for those with pneumonia. Consumer Reports examines the numbers of patients who die or are readmitted, infection rates and Medicare patient surveys of their experiences. Leapfrog looks at data from its surveys of hospitals, the consistency with which hospitals followed safe surgical practices and frequencies of infections and some types of patient harm. Healthgrades analyzes detailed Medicare records to find death and complication rates for 27 procedures and conditions.. Truven considers profitability along with quality in its assessments. U.S. News surveys physicians about which places they think are the best, and those reputation ratings account for a third of most of its assessments. U.S. News ranks hospitals by geography and singles out hospitals that do well in 16 specialties, including cancer, neurology and orthopedics.. “Ratings and ranking programs certainly offer people information they can use to make their hospital selections, but we don’t recommend relying on any one of them completely,” Jennifer Kennedy, a spokeswoman for St. Mary Mercy, said in an e-mail. “None are able to tell the whole story or paint a complete picture of the care that is delivered.”. Patient safety rankings are based on how frequently correct procedures or errors occur, so hospitals can get good grades even if they have made some egregious errors. .  a “B” to UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco even though California regulators have penalized UCSF eight times for infractions since 2008, most recently for .  in one patient and a .  of another. Those errors cost UCSF $200,000 in fines.. Dr. Josh Adler, the chief medical officer at UCSF, said penalties were partly a result of the hospital’s policy to make sure that all errors are reported to authorities. “The key is that we constantly strive to deliver the highest quality, safest, and most satisfying care, and that we are a learning organization,” he said in an e-mail.. The ratings groups believe the public benefits from the multitude of ratings. Dr. John Santa, who directs Consumer Reports’ health ratings, said consumers benefit from different vantages just as they do for cars or electronic devices, and the competition spurs each rating group to get better. “We think that’s consistent with good science,” Santa said.. Avery Comarow, health rankings editor for U.S. News, agrees. “People go to hospitals for different reasons and priorities,” he said. “I’m not sure there could be a single rating system that can do it all.”. Many of the hospital graders are expanding their awards. Last year, the Joint Commission identified 620 hospitals as “top performers,” up from 406 the previous year. Healthgrades now provides awards for emergency rooms, maternity care, pediatric care, bariatric surgery and gynecology surgery. In 2011, U.S. News started identifying the best hospitals in regions of the country, and identifies 748 hospitals as a “best” hospital in at least one specialty.. But because of limitations in data, the ratings cannot always offer patients the kind of specificity they seek. When Kathy Day of Bangor, Maine, needed a hysterectomy in 2011, she wanted to compare hospital infection rates for the procedure. But she said when she called Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, “the response I got from them was, ‘We don’t have to give you that information, we’re not required to report those infections until next year.’ ”. “I said, ‘I have cancer this year and I need surgery now, so next year doesn’t help me,'” recalled Day, 63, a registered nurse and consumer advocate. She said the hospital ultimately told her its infection rates were average, but the attitude turned her off so much that she underwent surgery successfully at Maine Medical Center.. Brigham and Women’s website publishes six types of infection rates, but not one for hysterectomies. “We are continually working on making data about more types of infections available,” a hospital spokesman, Tom Langford, said in an e-mail.. Much of the quality data is rudimentary, as the science of evaluating hospitals is still in its adolescence. Adding to the confusion is that hospitals can rise and fall from year to year as groups tweak their methods of assessment and as hospital performance shifts, even slightly. A study sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund, a health care philanthropy in New York, found that only 46 percent of hospitals ranked as top performers by Thomson Reuters in 2008 were also winners in 2007. In the Joint Commission’s rankings, 583 hospitals missed being designated a top performer because they fell short on just one of 45 measures.. In some cases, hospitals that have won awards are being penalized financially by Medicare for falling short on the government’s quality assessment. Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla., which is losing 0.54 percent of its Medicare payments this year under the government’s quality program, is a Healthgrades Distinguished Hospital for Clinical Excellence and was ranked the second best hospital in Oklahoma by U.S. News in 2012.. Paul Levy, the former CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said he is concerned that as awards multiply they may encourage complacency. “There’s a danger,” he said, “that some hospitals look at their excellent ranking and say ‘See, we’re there, we’re done,’ while process improving has got to be a never-ending philosophy.”. Some of the hospitals that do the best in the rankings have limited respect for them. Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., last year received praise from Leapfrog, U.S. News, the Joint Commission, Truven and Healthgrades. But Dr. William Adair, vice president for clinical transformation, says the hospital doesn’t license any of the distinctions. “We’re all made a little bit uneasy, to be frank about it,” Adair says. “Some of these organizations are looking for revenue. It blurs the effectiveness of the ratings processes.”. Still, many hospitals are happy to use the praise. Dr. Brotman from NYU said: “Even though there’s not a hospital executive who won’t tell you that they have a great deal of skepticism about a lot of the methodology, there’s not one who will tell you they don’t want to be on the lists.”|Mon Mar 18 17:16:49 +0000 2013||RT @jordanrau: As ratings multiply, 1/3 of hospitals now claim a distinction of one kind or another  via @KHNews|3.13700531107414e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/March/18/expanding-number-of-groups-offer-hospital-ratings.aspx

Insurers must cover 10 broad categories of care, including emergency services, maternity care, hospital and doctors’ services, mental health and substance abuse care and prescription drugs.. Essential benefit requirements apply mainly to individual and small group plans. They also apply to plans provided to those newly eligible for Medicaid coverage..

Many state benchmark plans require at least two drugs per class.. Responding to concerns from some advocacy groups, the final rule also states that insurers must have procedures to allow patients to get “clinically appropriate” prescriptions not on the plan’s list of covered medications.. “This is an improvement,” said Stephen Finan, director of policy for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “It suggests that if you need a drug and that’s not on the formulary, you can get it, which was not the case before.”. Advocates had wanted the government to require coverage of a broader range of drugs, but insurers and others said requiring many more would raise premium costs.

. Opponents of the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act say states can’t afford it, even with the federal government picking up most of the tab. But .  to .  expand Medicaid.. “While Medicaid expansion is not free, the combination of federal support for expansion populations and state savings in [other health and human services] programs makes full expansion less costly to the General Fund than no expansion until FY 2020-21,” concludes the analysis, by Denver economic consultant . . Brown’s report was commissioned by the . , a nonprofit, grant-making foundation .  of non-profit hospitals to for-profit hospital giant HCA. It no longer has ties to those hospitals. (The Colorado Health Foundation funds health reporting at Colorado Public Radio.). The expansion called for the in Affordable Care Act, which the U.S. Supreme Court . , says the federal government will pay 100 percent of expansion expenses for the first three years, and then states’ share will ramp up annually, reaching 10 percent by 2020.. Colorado is expected to adopt the expansion. Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, . . It will require changes in state laws, but Democrats hold solid majorities in both houses of the state legislature.. Brown’s analysis says expanding will save Colorado government $133.8 million compared to the cost of not expanding between 2014 and 2025. He says the state would save more than $20 million per year until 2018. After that savings decline, and then become costs starting in 2020, nearing the $20 million a year mark by 2025. But with the health law taking effect, those costs, Brown says, are still less than the state would spend by not expanding.. Hickenlooper has said that .  to pay for the expansion, but did not go so far as to say that it would be cheaper than not expanding. The governor says state expenses will be covered by revenue from .  and by reforming how Medicaid care is paid for and delivered.. Brown’s analysis says not expanding will be more costly, in part, because, “even if Colorado chooses not to expand … (Medicaid) enrollments … are expected to grow due to other provisions of the ACA.” Those include the ACA’s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and the expectation that some people seeking coverage in the state’s insurance exchange will discover they are Medicaid eligible instead.  Medicaid rolls could also grow, according to Brown, because of a “reduction in employer-sponsored insurance in response to ACA’s other provisions,” including employers using more part-time employees to escape the law’s requirement for many employers to cover full-time employees.. The analysis says expanding would add 275,000 Coloradans to state Medicaid rolls and would reduce the state’s uninsured rate by 189,000, from 11.1 percent to 7.7 percent.. Those numbers are in line with three other recent estimates of how many Coloradans would enroll in an expanded Medicaid, which range from 240,000 to 297,000. .  that 78,000 will drop private coverage to join Medicaid.. The other analyses, .  and .  found that the ten-year cost of the expansion to the state will range from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and that the federal share will be $11.4-$13.5 billion. (Kaiser Health News in an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.). Only the Brown analysis tries to quantify the overall economic impact to Colorado from expansion. It says it will grow the state’s gross domestic product by 0.74 percent, and add 22,388 jobs by 2025. “Of these jobs, 14,357 will be created in the first 18 months following expansion,” the report says. “Average household earnings … are $608 (per year) higher with Medicaid expansion.”.

|One, Mississippi has become No, Mississippi.. The Obama administration on Friday offered an explanation for why .  Mississippi’s bid to establish a state-based online health insurance marketplace, called One, Mississippi. In a letter, the federal government’s top exchange official said they had no choice because Gov. Phil Bryant would not allow the exchange to work with Medicaid and other agencies under his control.. “There is no feasible pathway to approving a state-based Marketplace in Mississippi for 2014 without support from Governor Bryant and agreements to coordinate with other state agencies,” Gary Cohen, director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight .  Friday to state Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney.. Federal officials said state-based marketplaces, as part of the conditions for their approval, must prove they can work with other agencies so people who apply for coverage will be directed seamlessly to private insurance or government programs such as Medicaid. Bryant, a Tea Party Republican, has made clear he would not allow that.. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia applied to develop a state-based marketplace, or exchange. Mississippi is the only one to be denied. Utah’s application is still facing uncertainty because Republican Gov. Gary Herbert does not want to meet all the federal requirements.. States that don’t form their own marketplace will have one run by the federal government starting Oct. 1, with coverage effective Jan. 1, 2014. The marketplaces are a key component of the federal health law to expand coverage to millions of people starting next year.. A federal official insisted that Bryant and other recalcitrant governors will not be able to impede operation of a federal exchange from connecting people to Medicaid.. Chaney, the Republican insurance commissioner,  had been developing the state exchange for 18 months and had even begun advertising the new website at college football games and on billboards. But when it came time to seek federal approval in December, Bryant stepped in the way, saying he would not aid its operation and that Chaney did not have the authority to start the exchange.. Federal officials Friday said they hope the Mississippi Insurance Department will apply for a state .  before the Feb. 15 deadline. In the partnership model, the federal government does most of the work while the state handles consumer assistance and reviews the health plans that apply for inclusion.|Sat Feb 09 00:22:49 +0000 2013||RT @philgalewitz: One, Mississippi Becomes No, Mississippi as Feds reject state's insurane exchange |3.000370004955095e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2013/02/feds-blame-mississippi-governor-for-exchange-denial/

|Rural health care administrators got some good news this week.. The Obama administration Monday proposed to ease some Medicare .  – a change that could save rural hospitals much-needed money by allowing for more flexible staffing requirements. But for about 450 health care professionals who attended this week’s . in Washington, D.C., sustaining the often low-volume hospitals will continue to be an uphill battle.. “We are going to lose hospitals,” said Lance Keilers, administrator at Ballinger Memorial Hospital in Texas, at a panel on Monday titled Threats to Rural Hospitals.. Keilers said the possibility of the reduced government payments resulting from the scheduled budget cuts, or sequestration, is not the only test these facilities face. He pointed out other possible threats from government regulation – like . if another nearby hospital opens. If this happens, health advocates said some rural communities will have less access to medical care, and states like  North Carolina would see thousands of job cuts in the industry.. Meanwhile, rural hospitals are often more efficient and cheaper to run than their urban counterparts serving a similar patient mix, according to Gregory Wolf, vice president of . .. Some attendees expressed the imperative to make sure members of Congress understand the difficulties rural hospitals face in this current fiscal climate.. “There’s a sense on Capitol Hill that rural hospitals are doing fine,” said Eric Zimmerman, a D.C.-based attorney who represents health care systems in matters of Medicare. He said the reality of shrinking budgets and the stress of transitioning to different payment methods was often lost in the policy-making process.. Keilers said the only way forward to prioritize rural-friendly legislation on the Hill was through cooperation and collaboration.. “This is it guys, we’re rural, we better stick together.”|Thu Feb 07 14:46:28 +0000 2013||RT @anrao: Will easing Medicare regulations help #rural hospitals keep their heads above water? #ruralhealth |2.9952956545223885e+17|http://bit.ly/VJKIAi

|Some families with costly job-based health coverage may be ineligible for federal subsidies to help them buy less expensive coverage through new online insurance markets, under final rules released Wednesday by the IRS.. The two rules, published by the Treasury Department .  and . , uphold earlier proposals outlining what is considered affordable, employer-sponsored coverage.. Under the federal health law, low and moderate-income workers with job-based coverage that is deemed unaffordable can opt out of that and turn to new marketplaces, called exchanges, to buy coverage with government subsidies.. But the rule defines the standard for affordability more narrowly than most consumer groups had hoped — as an amount less than 9.5 percent of household income to cover just that employee’s share of premium costs, not on what he or she must pay to cover their entire family, which is generally more expensive.. to base the affordability threshold on the cost of a family plan, saying the rules could prevent some children and spouses from getting coverage. A .  from the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated that a small percentage of uninsured children — 6.6 percent of the total, or at least 460,000 — may be shut out because of how the government proposed to define affordable coverage.. “It doesn’t make sense to test the affordability of children’s coverage by looking at the cost of covering one person, the employee,” said Joe Touschner, senior health policy analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. More than 100 groups, including the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Children’s Defense Fund, had signed a letter to Treasury making that argument.. Touschner acknowledged that if the IRS had used the cost of family coverage as the threshold it would have boosted the cost of the law because more people would become eligible for subsidies.. Supporters of the rule, among them employer groups and insurance brokers, say it closely follows the wording in the law and will be easier to administer.. The final .  to the federal law’s rule requiring most Americans to carry health insurance coverage, including not being able to afford coverage.. The exchanges and subsidies, as well as the requirement that most Americans carry insurance, go into effect on Jan. 1, 2014.|Wed Jan 30 19:40:55 +0000 2013||"RT @julie_appleby: IRS upholds what critics call the ""family penalty"" in final rule on affordable insurance, subsidies "|2.9670456351852134e+17|http://ow.ly/hgWxQ

|  Why do you oppose setting up a state health insurance exchange?.  Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, all of us Republicans across the nation believed this was a failed law, a law that would drive up health insurance costs, a law that would causes taxes to go up on employers and cause all Americans to have to buy a product in a marketplace at the insistence of the federal government, and [you] could be punished for your inactivity. I am against the foundation that it rests on.  This is a terrible law that continues to be flawed. The Supreme Court decision, which people believed changed everything, said one, there is a tax, which the president had been denying since the beginning, that it will cause costs for employers to go up, but also states cannot be forced to expand Medicaid.  I believe that this is a bait and switch, where they say here is $20 million and you form a state insurance exchange. Let the governor sit idly by in Mississippi and say nothing and that exchange will inherently determine if you deserve a subsidy, but also can automatically take you to Medicaid..  What’s wrong with the exchange directing people to Medicaid?.  Because it puts 300,000 [additional] Mississippians on the Medicaid rolls. We have got 640,000 people on Medicaid. That is 940,000 Mississippians on Medicaid. We cannot financially sustain that..  But won’t the exchange send people to Medicaid, no matter if the state or the federal government runs it?.   Remember what the Supreme Court said. The federal government cannot force the states to expand their Medicaid population. My argument [is] you are automatically expanding my Medicaid population. We can’t fund the Medicaid population we currently have without two things — raising taxes or making tremendous cuts, draconian cuts, in education, transportation, public safety and job creation..  What is the cost to the state of having 17 percent of the population without health insurance?.  I would rather pay extra to Blue Cross [to help cover uncompensated costs for the uninsured], rather than have to raise taxes to pay for additional Medicaid recipients. Medicaid recipients multiply their visits to a physician. It’s clear once someone goes on Medicaid, the number of times they go to a physician doubles, quadruples..  Some experts may argue people new to Medicaid have many health issues they need to address..  I make the argument that it’s free. It’s free and you have nothing else to do..  Are there any positive benefits to people being on Medicaid?.  Medicaid was meant to be a temporary [stop]gap for providing you medical treatment while you are looking for a job. Now we are saying, you can have a job and still receive Medicaid. So we have changed the whole dynamic. There is very little incentive for those 940,000 people on Medicaid to find a better job, or to go back to school, or to get [into] a workforce training program because they say: Look, if I go over $33,000,  [I] will lose Medicaid. There is no one who doesn’t have health care in America. No one.  Now, they may end up going to the emergency room. There are better ways to deal with people that need health care than this massive new program..  Didn’t you support the concept of an exchange when you were lieutenant governor in 2009?.  This is totally different. It was a Web-based system [we had worked on], where we hoped the private market, through competition, would provide lower rates. Democrats came in and said: We have a vehicle that came from the Republicans called an exchange, and let’s make that the central portal to expand Obamacare in the states, and if they don’t, they say you supported it before. That is patently untrue. If the federal government wants to use the exchange to expand Obamacare in Mississippi, let them do it. Let them try to meet the Oct. 1 deadline [to begin enrolling people], and let them come in and try to find personnel. Let them try to find the health physicians and nurses to provide the additional health care..  Will you do anything to block a federal exchange from operating in your state?.  Certainly I will if they try to expand the Medicaid population. If they say we are going to take this federal exchange and going to expand the Medicaid population, I will try to seek legal relief from that using the Supreme Court decision that said they are not allowed to do that..  Will you block the sharing of information from the federal exchange to your Medicaid agency?.  I have not made that decision yet. I am not going to violate the federal law if I believe that law to be fair… We don’t know what’s in this law. No one knows the full comprehensive effect of what this law will do. If we continue to determine the law is in violation of the 10.  Amendment, and states have the right to resist some of those measures, then we will seek opportunity to do that in court..  Is your dispute with Insurance Commissioner Chaney a microcosm of a split among Republicans regarding the health law?.  I think it’s a reflection of the massive confusion that exists about this law and its implementation. We are about to expand the largest social program since the Great Society and have very little known about what the law does. We have never done this type of thing before. Employers are very nervous. Members of the legislature are confused. They want to do the right thing. There is a political dynamic in this. Let’s be fair. If the Obama administration is expanding entitlements into states through expanding Medicaid, do they hope to reap some political benefits from that?  Of course they do..  Is the reverse true?  Do you hope to receive political benefits from resisting implementing the law?.  I think not. The easy political thing for me to do is to say: Oh yes, we are going to hand out this entitlement to another 300,000 people. And then I could campaign all across the state and say: Don’t forget you got that from me. I brought you free health care. That would be the easy thing to do. The hard thing would be, in 20 years, to explain to my grandchildren why they have to pay this massive debt that will continue to exist in America. That is the decision we are going to have to make: Do we take the easy way? Do we say: I am going to be so popular and surround myself with people to whom I am providing free health care? Or do I worry about future generations and the collapse of our free market system in America?|Wed Jan 23 21:05:22 +0000 2013||A Q&amp;A: RT @philgalewitz: Mississippi Gov.

|HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif. – The so-called bodega clinicas that line the streets of Los Angeles’ immigrant neighborhoods blend into a dense forest of commerce. Wedged between money order kiosks and pawn shops, these storefront doctors’ offices treat ailments for cash: a doctor’s visit is $20 to $40, a podiatry exam is $120 and at one bustling clinica, a colonoscopy is advertised on an erasable white board for $700.. County health officials describe the clinicas as a parallel health care system, servicing a vast number of uninsured Latino residents, yet the officials say they have little understanding of who owns and operates them, how they are regulated and the quality of the medical care they provide. Staffed with Spanish speaking medical providers, few of these low-rent clinics accept private insurance or participate in Medicaid managed care plans.. “Someone has to figure out if there’s a basic level of competence,” said Dr. Patrick Dowling, professor and chair of the department of family medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.. Not that researchers haven’t tried. Dr. Dowling, for one, has canvassed the local clinicas for. years as part of his research for the state to document physician shortages. What he and others have found, however, is that clinca owners were reluctant to answer their questions.. What is certain, though, is that despite their name, many of these clinicas are actually private doctor’s offices, not licensed clinics which are required to report regularly to federal and state oversight bodies. It is a distinction that deeply concerns Kimberly Wyard, chief executive of Northeast Valley Health Corporation, a non-profit group which runs 13 accredited health clinics for low-income Southern Californians. “They are off the radar screen,” said Wyard of the clinicas, “and it’s unclear what they’re doing.”. But driven by fast-approaching deadlines set by the Affordable Care Act, health officials in Los Angeles are vexed over whether to embrace bodega clinicas and bring them – selectively and gingerly – into the network of tightly regulated public and non-profit health centers that are driven more by mission than by profit to serve the uninsured.. Health officials see in the clinicas the tantalizing opportunity to fill persistent and profound gaps in the county’s strained safety net, including a chronic shortage of primary care physicians. By January 2014, up to 2 million currently uninsured Angelenos will need to enroll in Medicaid or buy insurance and find primary care. And the clinicas, public health officials note, are already well established in the county’s poorest neighborhoods where they are meeting the needs of Spanish-speaking residents. The clinicas also could continue to serve a market that the Affordable Care Act does not touch: undocumented immigrants who are prohibited from getting health insurance under the law.. Dr. Mark Ghaly, deputy director for Community Health at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, said bodega clinicas, a term he seems to have coined, that agree to some scrutiny could be a good way of addressing the physician shortage in these neighborhoods.. “Where are we going to find those providers?” he said. “One logical place to consider looking is these clinics.”. Los Angeles is not the only city with a sizable Latino population where clinicas have become a part of the street scape. Health care providers in Phoenix and Miami say clinicas are in many Latino neighborhoods.. But their presence in parts of Los Angeles can be striking, with dozens of storefront doctors’ offices in certain areas. Visits to more than two dozen clinicas in South Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley found Latino women in brightly colored nurses scrubs handing out cards and coupons that promise everything from pregnancy tests to tubal ligations. Others advertise evening and weekend hours, and, some 24-hour a day operations trumpet that they are “nunca cerramos” – never closed. That all-hours access – and up-front pricing – is critical, Latino health experts say, to a population that often works low-wage, around-the-clock jobs.. Also important, officials say, is that new immigrants from Mexico and Central America are more accustomed to a corner clinica, which is common in their home countries, than to the sprawling medical complexes or large community health centers found in the United States. And they can get the kind of medical treatments – including injections of hypertension drugs, vitamin solutions delivered intravenously and liberally dispensed antibiotics – that are frowned upon in traditional American medicine. . Many Latino immigrants have a “preference for injectables,” said Dr. Yelba Castellon-Lopez, a family medicine resident at UCLA raised in South Los Angeles who treats patients at a licensed clinic. And since common antibiotics are available over-the-counter in Mexico and other Latin American countries, patients often demand a prescription for the drugs even when it is not medically prudent. “If you try to explain they don’t need an antibiotic,” Ms. Castellon said, “people tend to walk out very dissatisfied.”. The waiting rooms at the bodega clinicas reflect the everyday maladies of peoples’ lives: a glassy-eyed child rests listlessly on his mother’s lap; a fit-looking young woman waits with a bag of ice on her wrist; a pensive middle-aged man in work boots stares straight ahead. For patients with ordinary complaints, the medical care at these bodega clinicas may be suitable, say county health officials and medical experts. But they say problems arise when the illness exceeds the boundaries of a physician’s skills or the patient’s ability to pay cash.. Dr. Raul Joaquin Bendana, who has been practicing general medicine since 1987 in South Los Angeles, said bodega clinicas will refer patients to him when, for example, they have uncontrolled diabetes. “They refer to me because they don’t know how to handle the situation,” he said. The clinica physicians by and large appear to have current medical licenses, a sample showed, but experts say they are unlikely to be board certified as specialists or have admitting privileges at area hospitals. That can mean some clinicas attempt to continue to treat patients who face serious illness.. Olivia Cardenas, a 40-year-old restaurant worker who lives in Woodland Hills, Calif., got a free pap smear at a clinica that advertises “especialistas” including gynecology. The pap smear came back abnormal, and the doctor told Cardenas she had cervical cancer. “Come back in a week with $5,000 in cash, and I’ll operate on you,” Cardenas said the doctor told her. “Otherwise you could die.”. Although Ms. Cardenas had gone to the clinica for years, and her husband had received ‘sueros’ there (IV therapy) she was shocked by the directive. She declined to pay the $5,000. Instead, a family friend helped her apply for Medicaid and she went to a licensed hospital for treatment. The diagnosis, it turned out, was correct.. Health care experts say clinicas’ medical practices would come under greater scrutiny if they were brought closer into the fold. Howard Kahn, chief executive of L.A. Care Health Plan, the nation’s largest public health plan, which contracts with private managed care companies, said: “I’m big on the idea that connectedness breeds quality.” Some here hold an uneasy hope that the clinicas could learn from licensed health centers how to follow their patients’ diabetes, hypertension and asthma, adopt electronic medical records and employ medical assistants to keep patients on track.. But being connected would mean the clinicas’ cash-only business model would need to change. Dowling, the UCLA researcher, said the lure of newly insured patients in 2014 might draw them in: “To the extent there are payments available, the legitimate ones might step up to the plate.”. Calls to a half dozen such clinics were met with no comment or were unreturned.There is at least one early indication that the clinicas may sit this one out: Clinica Mi Pueblo, regarded as scrupulous and well-run, recently sold four of its 11 clinics to a health maintenance organization over concerns that when the Affordable Care Act takes hold next year, it will lose a significant portion of its cash business.|Mon Jan 14 19:02:20 +0000 2013||MT @glennthrush: Great story ... about bodega clinics in LA -- a health care solution and problem rolled into 1. |2.908966479306629e+17|http://bit.ly/W0Iyrr

|After Congress’ fiscal cliff deal this week dug into hospitals’ pockets to avert a drop in Medicare payments to physicians, industry associations screamed. The president of the American Hospital Association said the reductions — nearly $15 billion over a decade — “will make it harder for patients to access the care they need.” The president of the Federation of American Hospitals also said patients would suffer because lawmakers had decided to “rob hospital Peter to pay for fiscal cliff Paul.”. Will hospitals be hobbled by Congress’ latest cuts? The answer may lie in a long-running dispute about whether Medicare has been overpaying hospitals for the past few years.. In late 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) changed the way hospitals submit bills for Medicare patients. Its new system created 749 categories to allow hospitals to describe the illness level of their patients more specifically. The goal was to make sure that a hospital treating a person who has pneumonia and other illnesses, such as diabetes, for instance, would be paid more than a hospital treating an otherwise robust patient with pneumonia.. But the change raised a concern, said Paul Matsui, executive director of The Advisory Board Co., a Washington consulting firm. Medicare officials “knew right from the get-go there was going to be some incentive to put more codes on the claims, make sure you have all the different complications and” other illnesses, Matsui said. “They knew that was going to look like a rise” in the severity of the patients’ conditions, he said. . So Medicare proposed cutting its payment levels to counterbalance the likely change in billing. But the hospitals dissuaded the government from cutting rates, disputing the inevitability that coding would creep up. . After several years, CMS examined billing trends and determined that hospital patients suddenly were deemed sicker and warranted higher payments. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, an independent agency that advises Congress, .  that the initial concerns about excess payments were correct and said the “improved coding increased payments by $6.9 billion over 2008 and 2009.”. Congress allowed Medicare to recover $6 billion of these overpayments through 2009, but last spring MedPAC estimated . between 2010 and 2012, which Medicare was not empowered to get back.  . The . , giving Medicare the power to recoup $10.5 billion of those overpayments over the next few years. The money will go toward putting off $30 billion in scheduled cuts in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients. . Medicare pays hospitals about $117 billion a year, so the $11 billion reduction is substantial. Hospitals insist that they have not been overpaid and that the government never properly took into account the increasing sickness of their patients. “We have never agreed with the methodology that MedPAC and CMS have used to try to separate out real change from documentation and coding changes,” said Caroline Steinberg, a vice president at the American Hospital Association.. “All arrows point to Medicare patients getting sicker, and the idea that MedPAC and CMS have put forth in their calculations is that patients are getting less sick,” she said. She said Medicare “overdid it by about 35 percent” in its effort to claw back some of the payments.. Hospitals are also irked at the cuts because they come on top of $155 billion worth of reductions over 10 years that were part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The thinking was that since the law expanded the number of people with insurance, hospitals wouldn’t need as much help caring for those without coverage. But along with the adjustment for overcoding, Congress’ fiscal cliff deal also extended until 2022 the health law’s reductions in payments for hospitals that treat large numbers of uninsured and poor patients. The extended cuts will save $4.2 billion.. Atul Grover, the chief public policy officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges, said that while hospitals would have preferred not to face any cuts, the $10.5 billion cut Congress chose in the deal sealed on New Year’s Day was better than other options on the table. One of those proposals that hospitals lobbied against would have lowered Medicare’s payments for services delivered in hospital outpatient clinics to the same level as Medicare pays doctors for those services performed in their offices—something that would have hurt teaching and safety net hospitals the hardest.. “We don’t like our hospitals being used to pay our physicians, but at least the cuts they chose hit everybody,” Grover said.|Fri Jan 04 04:03:19 +0000 2013||RT @jordanrau: Behind The Fiscal Cliff Deal, A Prolonged Hospital Finance Fight  My Latest @KHNews Story|2.870465260087173e+17|http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/January/04/fiscal-cliff-deal-hospital-finance-fight.aspx

|Medicare on Thursday disclosed bonuses and penalties for nearly 3,000 hospitals as it ties almost $1 billion in payments to the quality of care provided to patients. . The revised payments, which will begin in January, mark the federal government’s most extensive effort yet to hold hospitals financially accountable for what happens to patients. In what amounts to a nationwide competition, Medicare compared hospitals on how faithfully they followed rudimentary standards of care and how patients rated their experiences. . In many regions, the hospitals that did the best are not the ones with the most outsized reputations, but regional and community hospitals, according to government records. New York-Presbyterian in Manhattan and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, both dominant hospitals in their cities, will have their payments reduced. Other leading names in the hospital industry, including the Cleveland Clinic and Intermountain Medical Center in Utah, will receive bonuses, although not the largest in their regions. . In all, Medicare is rewarding 1,557 hospitals with more money and reducing payments to 1,427 others, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of records released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The maximum amount any hospital could gain or lose was 1 percent of its regular Medicare payments. . For nearly two-thirds of the hospitals, the changes are less than a quarter of a percent. In many cases, it’s little more than a rounding error on their bottom lines: Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles will have its payments reduced by 0.05 percent. Still, for hospitals with lots of Medicare patients, hundreds of thousands of dollars are at stake. . The biggest bonus this year is going to Treasure Valley Hospital, a physician-owned, 10-bed hospital in Boise, Idaho, that is getting a 0.83 percent increase in payment for each Medicare patient, the records show. Auburn Community Hospital, a nonprofit near Syracuse in upstate New York, is facing the biggest cut, losing 0.9 percent of every payment. . On average, hospitals in Maine, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah and South Carolina will fare the best, while hospitals in the District of Columbia, Connecticut, New York, Wyoming and Delaware come out among the worst, the data shows. . Results for hospitals within the same system often varied. For instance, in Rochester, Minn., the Mayo Clinic’s Methodist Hospital will be getting a bonus. But Mayo’s flagship St. Mary’s Hospital, also in Rochester, will be losing money. Dr. Michael Rock, an orthopedic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic, said that Medicare’s scoring system tends to favor hospitals with patients like those at Methodist, which primarily does elective surgeries, over hospitals with lots of trauma and emergency cases, which St. Mary’s handles. . The payment change was created by the federal health law and is known as the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. It is part of the government’s effort to shift away from paying hospitals and doctors based on the quantity of care they provide with no regard for how good a job they did. . “To me, it’s the tip of the iceberg for where we are going,” said Dr. Michael Henderson, chief of quality at the Cleveland Clinic. “We’ve been working on this for two or three years, and it really made us strive for excellent performance.”. Dr. Raj Behal, senior patient safety officer at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, which is getting a bonus, said the prospect of the financial incentives has not had a huge effect. “I wouldn’t say we’ve changed our course radically. All of these things were already on our radar,” he said. “These are nuts and bolts measures. All of us should be doing these things right. But is that enough?”. The program is one of several Medicare is launching to make hospitals and doctors accountable for quality and more careful stewards of public money. In October, Medicare also began reducing payments to 2,217 hospitals because too many of their . in their care within a month. Medicare already gives bonuses to the private Medicare Advantage insurance plans that score well on quality metrics. In 2015, the health law calls for the government to begin a quality . of 100 professionals or more, and that is to be expanded to all doctors by 2017. . The way the program works is that Medicare is reducing payments to all hospitals by 1 percent, estimated at $964 million. It then calculated a score on how much money each hospital deserved to get back based on the quality of its care. While every hospital is getting something back, almost half aren’t recouping the 1 percent they forfeited and thus are net losers. . Seventy percent of the scores are based on how frequently hospitals followed 12 basic clinical standards of care, such as controlling heart surgery patients’ blood sugar levels and giving them beta blockers to lower their blood pressure. The other 30 percent is determined by how well hospitals were rated by . asking about the communication and responsiveness of doctors and nurses and the cleanliness and quietness of their environment. . Medicare already publishes the scores for individual facilities on its . . Hospitals were scored both on how well they performed compared to their peers from July 2011 through March 2012, and how much they improved over time. . Nicholas Genna, CEO of Treasure Valley Hospital in Idaho, recipient of the biggest bonus, credited close attention to patients, including a low nurse-to-patient ratio and handwritten thank-you notes to patients, along with the fact that the doctors own the hospital. “People answer the phone with a smile on their face,” he said.. Thomas Filiak, the chief operating officer at Auburn Community Hospital in New York, which received the largest penalty, said executives have begun a number of initiatives to lower noise near patient hallways, including putting new wheels on squeaky food carts. “They sounded like Mack trucks going through the hallway,” he said.. Only 39 percent of Auburn patients reported their rooms were always quiet, below the national average of 60 percent, according to Hospital Compare. Filiak also said the hospital has been improving the quality of the food, which a private survey company found was affecting patient satisfaction, and ramping up the overall performance by focusing teams of workers on the problems. Auburn’s low scores included its rate of giving the right antibiotic to surgery patients, which did not occur 11 percent of the time. . “We know we started off at the bottom, but we are going to work our way to much more acceptable scores,” Filiak said. The penalty will cost Auburn an estimated $100,000, he said, which the hospital’s $85 million budget can absorb without having to take drastic measures like layoffs. . The penalties are impacting some types of hospitals more than others, according to an analysis Thursday by Dr. Ashish Jha’s research team at the Harvard School of Public Health. Bigger hospitals, teaching hospitals and hospitals with the most poor patients tended to do worse than smaller hospitals, hospitals that don’t train residents and hospitals with a more affluent patient mix, the researchers found. Fifty-seven percent of for-profit hospitals are receiving bonuses, while only 21 percent of government-owned hospitals are gaining money. . It is far from clear that the new payment program will significantly improve hospitals. When Medicare .  with 266 hospitals that volunteered through the Premier hospital alliance, performance scores shot up significantly. But a . found that other hospitals not receiving financial incentives ultimately did just as well. Death rates for patients in the demonstration project also were no better than for patients elsewhere, another study found. A . found the lowest-performing hospitals did not get appreciably better. . Harold Miller, a health care expert in Pittsburgh, said he doubted the amount of money at play is enough to change the way these institutions function. “It’s better than nothing, but it’s not what is necessary,” Miller said. “It doesn’t fix the underlying problem, which is fee for service.”. Others say because Medicare insures so many hospital patients, executives have no choice but to respond to the incentives. “It has definitely captured the attention of the industry,” said Chas Roades, chief research officer at the Advisory Board Co., a consulting firm that advises hospitals. About 40 private insurers have already adopted their own versions of pay for performance, which Roades said closely track the ones Medicare is using. “They can do that because of the air cover of the largest payer putting in place this process,” he said. . In a . , Medicare called the program “carefully crafted” and “built on the same recommendations that private purchasers of health care and the Institute of Medicine have recommended and tested for a decade or more.” The Institute of Medicine is an independent advisory group and part of the National Academy of Sciences. . Medicare will begin adjusting payments next month through the end of the federal fiscal year in September and will retroactively apply the changes to payments made in the last three months of this year. The cumulative gain or loss for each facility will not be clear until the end of the fiscal year, since hospitals do not know exactly how many patients they will end up admitting and for what conditions. . The bonuses and penalties do not apply to money Medicare pays hospitals for capital expenses, to teach residents or to treat large numbers of low-income patients. Hospitals with too few cases and ones that only offer specific specialties, such as psychiatry, long-term care, rehabilitation and cancer treatment, are exempted. Maryland hospitals are also excluded because the state has a unique reimbursement arrangement with the federal government. . While the numbers of winners and losers in the value-based purchasing program were about even, 2,245 hospitals, or about two-thirds, will end up losing money this year after the readmissions penalties are factored in, according to the KHN analysis. A total of 277 hospitals will lose 1 percent or more of their reimbursements. The Medical Center of Southeastern Oklahoma in Durant will take the biggest hit, with Medicare lowering its payments by 1.8 percent. .

|The game of football isn’t played without its share of injuries.. Look at just one of yesterday’s marquee games: The contest between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers .  in Ravens’ tight end Dennis Pitta and the Steelers’ running back Isaac Redman receiving concussions. A Steelers’ defensive lineman, Ziggy Hood, also left the game with a back injury.. Given the increased interest in providing better care for players, including more . , National Football League officials announced Monday a new way to track and treat injuries.. The NFL said it is implementing an electronic health records system that will eventually be adopted by all 32 teams. The system, which will be phased in over two seasons, will take the place of paper medical records and will be completely transportable, from hand-held devices to hospitals, tracking a player’s injury and medical history, and even providing medical personnel video footage of player injuries. That will make is easier for doctors to have access to a player’s complete record, especially if they are injured while playing on the road.. Players will also be able to provide their records to their personal physicians.. Next season eight teams (the New England Patriots, New York Jets and Giants, Baltimore Ravens, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos) will keep their player’s health information electronically. By 2014 the entire league will transition to electronic health records. The NFL estimates that its 10-year contract with . , based in Westborough, Mass., will cost anywhere between $7 million to $10 million.. “We’ve always embraced technology,”  Brian McCarthy, the NFL’s vice president of communications said. “We see this as a great opportunity for medical personnel: providing them even more tools to do their work in real time.”. Records will be able to move with a player, should they be traded to another team, and are touch and speech-capable. Girish Kumar Navani, the CEO and co-founder of eClinicalWorks, says the implementation of EMRs creates a much more fluid system of care coordination.. “We are making the scope of this medical data digital. Which means the pharmacy will be connected electronically, as well as the labs and the diagnostic medical imaging centers.” All this, Navani says, will be shareable with the team as well as other medical staff.. Incorporating video streaming is a new feature for eClinicWorks, and Navani says that it will allow doctors will be able to see what exactly caused a player’s injury. Currently the NFL has an injury reporting system in which data is entered manually, but Navani says that the new EMRs will sync with the current technology of the league, including a web-based application about concussion injuries.|Tue Nov 20 17:49:11 +0000 2012||RT @farzad_onc: #NFL and #HealthIT- peanut butter and chocolate to me- two things I love that go great together. |2.7094690686633574e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2012/11/nfl-medical-records-go-hi-tech/

|U.S. doctors are no longer the laggards when it comes to using health information technology in their practices. But they are still more weighed down by paperwork and health care costs than many of their Western counterparts.. A .  in ten of the world’s wealthiest countries took a new look at health IT adoption, updating a 2009 study conducted by The Commonwealth Fund and Harris Interactive.. Two-thirds of the American physicians in a sample size of 1,012 reported using electronic health records, compared to 46 percent three years ago. More doctors also said their practice included e-mailing patient summaries and test results.. The Netherlands, Norway and New Zealand adopted the technologies earlier, and almost all of their physicians continued to report using EMRs since 2009. All three countries have some form of universal health care.. “Bringing in EMRs only makes sense when standards have been set,” said Cathy Schoen, a lead author of the study and senior vice present of policy, research and evaluation at the Commonwealth Fund.. Schoen said more U.S. physicians were open to transitioning from to paper to electronic records and exchanges after national policies were put into place to regulate the technology. The Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services Incentive Programs govern the “meaningful use” of electronic health records and provide incentives to physicians who adopt systems that meet specific criteria.. Dr. Jeffrey Cain, president of the American Association of Family Physicians, said primary care doctors were the first to implement electronic health records, even though the cost was high for their practices compared with that of specialty practices. He said newer physicians entering the workforce, who are generally more comfortable with technology, have added to the momentum driving EMR use.. While health IT advancements foretell more efficient practice, only 15 percent of American physicians thought the country’s health care system worked well, according to the study. And they blamed insurance coverage restrictions for stymieing access to care and undermining potential for change.. “It’s expensive and fragmented,” Cain said in response to complicated insurance reimbursements. He said family physicians spent an average of eight hours a week filing paperwork, because insurance companies and federal coverage plans each had a different process.. Primary care physicians are hopeful that changes advanced by the health law – including coverage expansions – could prove helpful, according to the Commonwealth Fund’s Schoen. “Right now it’s complexity without value,” she said.|Thu Nov 15 21:25:21 +0000 2012||RT @anrao: U.S. docs no longer way behind on EMRs, but access to care still an issue for many @KHNews  |2.6918936906631168e+17|http://bit.ly/QJIJJX

||Wed Nov 07 14:43:39 +0000 2012||Here's what's next in health care after Obama win: |2.6618917516490342e+17|http://khne.ws/VSZe34
|President Barack Obama’s re-election ensures the survival of his landmark health care law, but predominantly Republican state officials will get a big say in how it is carried out.. State lawmakers will control whether millions of uninsured people get coverage through Medicaid beginning in 2014, as the law envisions. They’ll also decide whether to set up online markets where individuals can shop for coverage and seek federal subsidies to lower their costs.. Next year, 30 states will be led by Republican governors, and 24 will have Republican-controlled legislatures. Most of those had challenged the law in the Supreme Court.  Still, analysts believe the president’s victory will prod those, as well as several reluctant Democratic-led states, to move forward.. “Red states and undecided states [will] reconsider what they have been saying and doing the past few months,” said John Poelman, senior director of Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm advising states on carrying out the law, citing pressure from consumers, hospitals and other providers to expand coverage.. States have considerable sway over how the law is carried out because the Supreme Court gave them the power to reject the expansion of Medicaid, which had been expected to cover more than half of the 30 million people gaining health insurance under the law.. Since the court’s decision, six Republican governors in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana and Georgia have said they will not participate, even though the federal government would cover the costs of new enrollees through 2016 and at least 90 percent thereafter.. If those governors follow through, they could significantly undermine the law’s goal of extending coverage to uninsured Americans.. Most analysts are betting that won’t be the case, however, because billions in newly available federal subsidies and intense lobbying by health providers and consumers will spur most states to reassess their positions. The most recalcitrant, such as Texas and Florida, may opt out initially.. “Not all states will expand Medicaid in 2014, but within a couple of years, all of them will have,” Poelman predicted. “That’s similar to what happened when Medicaid began in 1965. The program did not start in every state initially, but nearly all had it by 1970. Arizona was the last state to add the program in 1982.”. State lawmakers will also play a key role in deciding whether to expand Medicaid when they convene this winter and next spring.  . “When state legislatures are back in session, we expect a flurry of attention to what the states will do,” said Richard Cauchi, health program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures.. Republicans will completely control 24 state legislatures next year — three more than this year. Democrats will control 18 — five more than they did this year. The rest are split or tied.. Mike Fasano, a Republican and one of the longest serving Florida lawmakers, said with the president’s win, the GOP-dominated state legislature would “take a hard look” at expanding Medicaid — despite the opposition of Republican Gov. Rick Scott.. Fasano, who is moving from the state Senate to the state House next year, said Florida can’t afford to miss out on new revenue without having its own plan to help more than four million residents who lack health insurance.. He acknowledged that challenging Scott would be an uphill battle but said the governor’s waning popularity might embolden lawmakers.. Officials in other states insist they will opt out of the Medicaid expansion regardless of the election outcome. “An Obama victory won’t change our strategy,” said Tony Keck, Medicaid director of South Carolina, although he acknowledged it might spur questions from the Republican-controlled state legislature.. Keck said the only way state officials might consider expanding the program is if they can scale back eligibility and benefits and require Medicaid recipients to pay more for their care — requirements the Obama administration has generally opposed.. Sandy Praeger, Kansas’ insurance commissioner and past president of National Association of Insurance Commissioners, expects many states to attempt to negotiate smaller Medicaid expansions than called for in the law.. Some, for instance, might propose expanding coverage to people who make up to 100 percent of federal poverty level ($23,050 for family of four), instead of the 133 percent ($31,000 for a family of four) required by the law. A more limited expansion would be cheaper for states that will have to start paying some of the bill in 2017. The administration has yet to say whether states can do a partial expansion.. The first battles are likely to be over the health law’s new insurance exchanges, which are supposed to make it easier to find an affordable plan and to help people in small group and individual insurance market determine if they qualify for new federal subsidies.. States have to give federal regulators a plan by Nov. 16 detailing how they will move forward with their own exchanges, with enrollment slated to launch next October. Under the law, the federal government would set up exchanges where states don’t.. As of late September, .  or agreed to do so in partnership with the federal government, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) . “It certainly will matter who is in the governor’s office for how states will approach the decision” on exchanges, said. Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy of State Health Policy.. He noted that after Republican governors won in Maine and Wisconsin in 2011, both put the brakes on efforts to implement the law, which had been started by their Democratic predecessors.. But some governors who are worried about the costs are also concerned that if the federal government steps in, they may lose control over their insurance markets, said Krista Drobac, director of the health division at the National Governors Association.. Whether states that have stood on the sidelines until now can meet the tight deadlines to have the exchanges running by late next year is an open question. That timeline is also likely to be a challenge for the federal government which will have to review hundreds of insurance plans if it sets up the marketplaces in dozens of states. Consumers in federally operated exchanges may initially have fewer choices than in those run by states.. Praeger expects that Kansas and other previously undecided states will agree to partner with the federal government to move forward.. “I expect to see a lot of activity between now and Nov 16,” she said. “States will look at this more pragmatically to keep their options open.”|Wed Nov 07 06:35:45 +0000 2012||RT @philgalewitz: Obama win is victory for his health law, but states hold its destiny |2.6606638934801613e+17|http://bit.ly/YWf8Nr

|Obstetricians, gynecologists and emergency room physicians won’t be eligible for higher Medicaid pay rates for primary care doctors that start in January under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration ruled late Thursday.. Instead, the higher Medicaid rates, which will be in effect for two years, are reserved for family doctors, internists and pediatricians, because those specialties are specifically listed in the 2010 law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. The OB/GYNs and ER doctors sought to be included after regulators released preliminary rules in May saying that internal medicine and pediatric sub-specialists, such as pediatric cardiologists, would be eligible for the higher pay when providing primary care.. The decision was included in the long-awaited .  to implement a provision in the Affordable Care Act that will pay primary care doctors the same rates when treating patients on Medicaid as they get when caring for seniors in the Medicare program.. While Medicaid doctors’ fees vary by state, they are generally far below those paid by Medicare and private plans. The change, which will cost $11 billion and be funded by the federal government, means a 64 percent average pay increase, according to an Urban Institute analysis of the rates in 2010.. Though the pay hike takes effect Jan. 1, it will likely be several months until many doctors see the higher reimbursements, because states have until March 31 to file paperwork with CMS to detail how they will pay out the money.. The Obama administration is hoping the higher fees will entice more doctors to treat Medicaid patients. But the limited duration of the pay raise has lowered expectations.. American Academy of Family Physicians President Jeffrey Cain said in a statement that the final rule bringing Medicaid payments up to par with Medicare for primary care “is a step in the right direction.”. But Cain added, “Unless Congress acts to permanently extend and fund this provision, a sudden return to disparate and inadequate payment for primary care services needed by Medicaid patients after only two years will again threaten to restrict their access to such needed services.”.  until now, in the absence of final rules and due to the uncertainty about the health law’s fate after . .. The final regulation removed a requirement for states to verify that doctors are board certified in family medicine, internal medicine or pediatrics before making the bonus payments. Instead, doctors will only have to “self-attest” that they are in one of  the eligible specialties to get the higher pay.. The final regulation also clarified that nurse practitioners and physician assistants would be eligible for the higher Medicaid pay, but only when they are working under the supervision of a physician in one of the eligible specialties.|Fri Nov 02 18:37:02 +0000 2012||RT @philgalewitz: OB/GYNs And ER Docs Excluded From Health Laws Medicaid Pay Hike  Capsules  via @khnews|2.6443596997607014e+17|http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2012/11/obgyns-and-er-docs-excluded-from-health-laws-medicaid-pay-hike/

|"Community health centers in New Hampshire were the most likely to keep diabetics’ blood sugar under control. Vermont’s health centers had the best child immunization rates. Maine’s centers had the highest percent of pregnant women getting early prenatal care. . A Kaiser Health News analysis of the latest federal data on the nation’s nearly 1,200 community health centers showed wide variation in the quality of care delivered by the private, nonprofit clinics which are expected to play a pivotal role under the federal health care law. . More than 20 million people — mostly the poor and uninsured — get primary care at the federally funded centers. To help them prepare to treat millions of newly insured people beginning in 2014, . .. Centers in New England generally performed better than centers in the South and West, according to the analysis of data obtained through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. . Mississippi’s health centers, for instance, had the highest proportion of low birthweight babies, which puts newborns at risk for lung and other problems. Wyoming and Oregon had some of the lowest child immunization rates. . The differences may partly be explained by higher rates of insurance coverage in New England which make it more likely people will seek care when they need it. Those without coverage must pay out of pocket for every visit, even if fees are based on a sliding scale. Centers with more insured patients also get paid more for their services so they also have more money to hire case managers and other staff. . Other differences that might affect health outcomes include state income levels, racial and ethnic makeup and dietary habits. In some cases, data reflect larger health-related trends in a state.. But even centers in the same city often performed differently.. “We hope clinics can learn from this information [because] we need a safety net that survives and thrives,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group. He attributed the variation to the fact that some clinics treat a large number of patients speaking multiple languages, or who lack insurance and may be reluctant to buy medicine or follow through with other treatments, or who are migrants or homeless.. The centers are required to submit data to the federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) on 11 quality measures, including rates of immunization and cervical cancer screenings, early prenatal care and how often patients were assessed for obesity and smoking. About half the centers have electronic records and . ; the rest provide a sample of their records.. The National Association of Community Health Centers, a trade group, questions the data’s usefulness, noting the results are not adjusted for patients’ health status, or for centers that have high rates of migrants, homeless or uninsured patients. Nonetheless, it said it would work with the government “to develop a rigorous and transparent system for measurement and improvement.”. Despite those shortcomings, the data are a helpful barometer, said Peter Shin, associate professor of health policy at George Washington University. “It gives centers a sense of where they are and where they have to go to improve,” he said.. Unlike government report cards on hospitals and nursing homes, patients are not expected to use this data to shop for health centers. Typically, people go to the clinic closest to where they live or work. And the government has done little to make the data about individual centers available. . The information is geared to motivating centers to improve and to helping the government identify those that need additional help, said Jim Macrae, HRSA associate administrator. “Despite serving a population that is often sicker and more at risk than seen nationally, health centers are making significant progress on improving the health of their patients,” Macrae said. “Continuing that progress is a high priority for us.”. He noted the average rate of women getting early prenatal care improved by 5 percentage points over the past five years.. Several studies including a .  show the quality of care at the health centers is comparable to that delivered at private doctors’ offices, even though the centers typically see patients who are poorer and sicker. . But like the care given in doctors’ offices, the centers’ performance varies widely — with some excelling in some areas while doing poorly in others.. Maine placed among the highest-ranked states on five of the 11 measures: prenatal visits, diabetes and blood pressure control, low birthweight babies and cervical cancer screening rates.. In contrast, Wyoming was among the worst-ranked states on six of the measures: diabetes and blood pressure control, child and adult weight screening, tobacco assessment and immunization rates. . Nevada ranked poorly on prenatal care, child weight screening and tobacco cessation counseling.. Dr. Darren Rahaman, chief medical officer at Nevada Health Centers which has 23 clinics, attributed those scores to the large number of uninsured patients who are less likely to get needed care or medicine because they don’t have the money. Health centers are required to charge the uninsured on a sliding fee scale based on their income. . About 30 percent of pregnant women at his facilities get early prenatal care, compared to 70 percent among centers nationally. “Women don’t come in because they are concerned about having to pay out-of-pocket for care,” Rahaman said. . Pines Health Services, a health center in Caribou, Maine, near the Canadian border, has some of the best quality scores in the state and nationally. CEO Jim Davis said it helps that only a small percent of its patients are uninsured. Better finances enable the center to use case managers to follow up with patients and make sure they’re taking their medications. It also helps that the center works in a relatively small, close-knit community. “Our providers know our patients as friends and family,” he said.. Nearly nine in 10 pregnant women at the center get early prenatal care because its obstetricians are well known and make sure women come in as soon as they know they are pregnant. Despite the high marks, Davis said he sees room to improve. “Even if we are good, it is still not enough,” he said..  | "|Thu Nov 01 14:06:42 +0000 2012||RT @felicejfreyer: Are RI's community health centers doing a good job?

|When a brand-name drug to help prevent premature births was approved last year, its $1,500-a-dose-price alarmed state and private sector insurance officials.. Many restricted use of the FDA-approved Makena in favor of $20- to $40-a-dose versions that had been made for years by pharmacies, saying that would give more women access to the treatment. Federal officials, sympathetic to such arguments, allowed the pharmacies to continue making the unapproved drugs.. But those decisions are now getting a second look following a deadly meningitis outbreak linked to a different pharmacy-made drug that has sickened hundreds of people and killed 28. No one has been reported injured by the pregnancy drug knockoffs. But the judgments made about Makena offer a window into the difficult tradeoffs between cost, safety and access sometimes confronted by policymakers and insurers at a time of growing angst over drug prices. . They also highlight the increased role of these pharmacies, some of which have begun to function as de facto drug manufacturers mass producing treatments for asthma, menopause and pain, among other conditions, but with far less oversight.  . Vials of a compounded version of the injectable pregnancy drug were among the dozens of products recalled by the now-shuttered New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Mass., believed to be the source of the fungus-contaminated steroids linked to the meningitis outbreak. Experts say contracting meningitis from the pregnancy drug is unlikely because it’s administered into muscle, not the spine. But a contaminated dose “could cause a local infection,” said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Curtis Allen.. More significantly, potency problems might make the drug less effective in preventing a premature birth. . Earlier this year, the FDA investigated complaints by the brand name drugmaker, KV Pharmaceutical, about the quality of some pharmacy-made products. Testing a small number of samples, the agency said in June that a few failed potency tests, but there were no “major safety problems.” At the same time, it advised that “approved drug products, such as Makena, provide a greater assurance of safety and effectiveness than do compounded products.”. That didn’t shake the faith of at least a half dozen state Medicaid programs and some large private insurers, which continue to pay for the less expensive compounds.  . Alabama Medicaid officials say they had “not one problem” with the pharmacy-made versions, although they recently began covering Makena after getting deeper discounts from the drugmaker, said Kelli Littlejohn, director of clinical services and support for the state’s Medicaid program.. Neither the federal agency that oversees state Medicaid programs, the state Medicaid directors association, the drug manufacturer or doctors’ groups could say how many state programs restrict access to the FDA-approved drug.. Up to 150,000 women in the U.S., at risk of having a repeat pre-term delivery, may be prescribed Makena or the pharmacy-made versions of the progesterone drug. The drug does not prevent premature birth in all those who take it. Tests leading to Makena’s approval found that 37 of 100 women taking Makena still delivered prematurely. But that was an improvement over the control group. Of the 100 women not given the drug, 55 gave birth early.. KV, which did not develop the drug, purchased legal rights to it another firm for nearly $200 million, and won market exclusivity for seven years. It assumed state Medicaid programs — and private insurers — would cover the FDA-approved version and that it would soon recoup its investment.. Almost immediately, however, the drug’s price, called “outlandish” by a March of Dimes official, provoked indignation from doctors’ groups and some members of Congress. In late March, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services advised state Medicaid programs that they could continue to pay for the cheaper versions of the drug, which have been available since about 2003. The agency did not return calls seeking comment.. On that same day, the FDA issued what many observers saw as an unusual statement, saying that “to support access to this important drug, at this time and under this unique situation,” it would not take enforcement action against pharmacies that properly and safely made similar versions of the drug.. In the past, the FDA had sent warning letters or pursued other action against pharmacies when it could show they were mass producing copies of FDA-approved drugs.. “The FDA does not usually recommend that patients use compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs,” pharmacists Yesha Patel and Martha Rumore say in an .  in the July issue of P&T, a journal aimed at physicians, insurers, hospitals and others developing drug coverage policies.. Pharmacists who mix or “compound” drug formulations are allowed to make formulations for individual patients who can’t use traditional drugs, but not to mass produce compounds. They are generally overseen by state regulators, not the FDA.. Not long after the FDA statement, financially beleaguered KV lowered its price for Makena to $690 a dose — bringing the total cost to about $14,490 for a woman who needs 21 doses. For some Medicaid programs, that was still too much.. “Even at this price, it remains out of reach for state Medicaid programs and the women they cover,” Louisiana Medicaid leaders wrote in a letter to health care providers in April 2011. By covering the pharmacy-made version, they could ensure that more women would receive the treatment, reducing the number of pre-term births in the state. Health officials estimated that a premature baby cost the state Medicaid program $33,433 in the first year of life, versus $3,671 for a full-term infant. . Louisiana still requires doctors to get special approval to prescribe Makena. . Similarly, Texas doctors must show there is no pharmacy able to make or deliver the drug to their offices to get coverage. That policy is now under review, a spokeswoman said.. Before Kentucky doctors may use Makena, Medicaid requires them to show that a woman has had a bad reaction to the compounded version – or had previously tried it and delivered prematurely.. Doctors in Wisconsin must explain why a woman might have trouble with a compounded drug, while doctors in South Carolina must show medical necessity for the branded drug.. “Some of these policies are a little more subtle than others,” said Scott E. Goedeke, a senior vice president with Ther-Rx, KV’s marketing subsidiary. “But they have similar effects: Physicians who want to prescribe the FDA-approved Makena learn from experience that process is so difficult or prohibitive they may stop trying.”. Blaming those policies for its financial troubles – along with what it describes as the FDA’s failure to enforce its market exclusivity for Makena – KV has filed lawsuits against Illinois, South Carolina and Georgia, alleging that the rules expose Medicaid patients to “unapproved compounded versions … of uncertain quality.”. The company won a preliminary injunction against Georgia to keep it from enforcing the coverage rules. In August it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a month before its lawsuit against the FDA was dismissed.. Goedke added that the firm has granted extra discounts to Medicaid programs, bringing the price to below $300 a dose.. Insurers covering the private market, meanwhile, have a range of rules around the use of Makena. UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation’s largest insurers, says in a policy document that it “continues to support the use of compounded, preservative-free” versions of the drug through “local and national… pharmacies.” However, it also reimburses doctors who choose to prescribe Makena.. Cigna covers Makena, as well as the compounded drugs, according to an April 2012 policy document.. Still, some physicians may feel pressure to prescribe the cheaper versions even when the insurer says it will pay for the brand name drug.. “Most insurance companies say they cover Makena, but they also send letters advising us that in trying to keep down the cost of health care, we are strongly encouraged to use the cheaper alternative, which is the compounded drug,” said Michael Randell, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Atlanta. “Sometimes we can feel forced to comply with wishes of insurance companies, or they might retaliate and take us off their plan.”. Because Makena contains the same active ingredient, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as the pharmacy-made drugs, there is little debate over whether the drugs are similarly effective – assuming the compounded version contains active ingredients that are mixed at the correct potency and under sterile conditions.. But as the investigation of NECC demonstrates, potency and purity problems have arisen with pharmacy-made drugs. Oversight of pharmacies is inconsistent at best. . A report this week by Massachusetts Rep. Edward Markey, a Democrat, described the unsanitary conditions there as “just the tip of an industry iceberg that has long needed reform and federal oversight.”. Last week, KV .  with the U.S. International Trade Commission alleging that the New England center and other pharmacies use active ingredients imported from Chinese factories that are not routinely inspected by the FDA.. Patient advocate Amy Allina at the National Women’s Health Network in Washington D.C. puts the blame on KV for overpricing Makena, but believes pharmacies making compounded medications need more oversight. . Noting that regulations follow “tragedies where people die,” she predicted the meningitis fatalities “could be the turning point for compounding pharmacies.”. The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, the industry’s lobbying arm, said its facilities are already “regulated extensively” by state boards of pharmacy, the FDA and others. It noted, however, that the Massachussets pharmacy at the center of the meningitis investigation “appears to have exceeded its scope of authority … and engaged in the manufacture and distribution of prescription drugs without registering.”|Wed Oct 31 16:38:36 +0000 2012||RT @Julie_Appleby $1,500-a-dose drug leads insurers to favor pharmacy-made drug but such policies getting new scrutiny |2.6368138908022784e+17|http://ow.ly/eUPTe
